Episode 18 - Making a Difference

1
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,600
I don't believe it!

2
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
What's wrong?

3
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Carter Boswell!

4
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Who's Carter Boswell?

5
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
He's running for the school board.

6
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
The election's next month.

7
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
What's wrong with wanting to be on the school board?

8
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Nothing.

9
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
But he wants to cut the school budget!

10
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Maybe it needs cutting.

11
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Cutting the budget is fine,

12
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
but he wants to do it

13
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
by cutting all the cultural programs.

14
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
No music, no dance,

15
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
no concert, no stage presentations.

16
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Why does he want to do that?

17
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,600
He says it's to save the taxpayers' money,

18
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
and I think he believes

19
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
that the taxpayers will vote for him

20
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
if he spends less on the cultural programs.

21
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
He's probably right.

22
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Lots of people want their taxes

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
used for new books

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
and a new paint job in the schoolrooms.

25
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Maybe some of us would like to pay a little bit more

26
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
and keep the cultural programs for our kids.

27
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Well, I'm not sure. Ellen.

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,600
I hear it from my patients.

29
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Lots of people are tired of higher taxes.

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
I know,

31
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
but if Boswell wins

32
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
he'll be an important decision-maker

33
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
on the school board,

34
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
and he doesn't know anything

35
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
about our children's education.

36
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Who's running against him?

37
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Nobody. That's the problem.

38
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Well, it sounds to me like Carter Boswell

39
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
is going to win this seat on the board.

40
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Oh, not if I can stop him!

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
And how are you going to stop him?

42
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
I don't know.

43
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Maybe I'll run against him.

44
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Well, you've got my vote.

45
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,600
I'm serious, Philip.

46
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Why shouldn't I run?

47
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Why shouldn't you run for what, Mom?

48
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Your mother is thinking of

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
running for the school board.

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Hey, that's terrific, Mom!

51
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Against Carter Boswell?

52
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Great!

53
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Well, if I run for office,

54
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
the voters will have a clear choice.

55
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,600
I stand for everything Boswell doesn't.

56
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
I think a lot of people will vote for you

57
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
against Boswell, Ellen.

58
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
I'll vote for you.

59
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Will you help me if I do run?

60
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Absolutely.

61
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
The trouble is

62
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
it takes a little bit of money to run a campaign.

63
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,600
I think you can make a difference, Ellen.

64
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
And in a short campaign

65
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
you wouldn't need as much money.

66
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
You know something, Ellen?

67
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Why not give the people of Riverdale a clear choice?

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
I'm with you.

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
You can make a difference.

70
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Come in.

71
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Mr. Maxwell?

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Yes, Charles Maxwell.

73
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
My name is Ellen Stewart.

74
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Hello.

75
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Please, sit down.

76
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,600
You asked to see me.

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
What would you like to see me about?

78
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,600
I'd like your help.

79
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Well,

80
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,600
I'm editor of the most influential newspaper in Riverdale.

81
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Actually, it's the only newspaper.

82
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
A lot of people would like my help.

83
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Do you have a story?

84
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
I'm planning to run for the school board.

85
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Against Carter Boswell?

86
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Yes.

87
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Well, that is news.

88
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Will you announce that I'm running?

89
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Sure.

90
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
But I need some information.

91
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Of course.

92
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Why will the voters vote for you against Boswell,

93
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Mrs. Stewart? Stewart

94
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Because I care.

95
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,600
"Vote for Ellen Stewart. She cares."

96
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Not a bad slogan.

97
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,600
But what do you care about?

98
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Well, I care about the children of our town.

99
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
I don't want them to grow up

100
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
without cultural programs in our school.

101
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Do you have a plan?

102
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,600
I want our children to learn

103
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
more than reading, writing, and arithmetic.

104
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,600
I want to keep the after-school programs -

105
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
the music, the concerts.

106
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,600
It's not a bad plan.

107
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
But who's going to pay for all of this?

108
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
We are.

109
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,600
The citizens of Riverdale, of course.

110
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
I plan to get help

111
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
from the businessmen and the corporations of Riverdale.

112
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
That's fair enough.

113
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Exactly what do you want from me, Mrs. Stewart?

114
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,600
You don't know me.

115
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,600
I can't expect you to take my side against Boswell.

116
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
But I do need some publicity

117
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
so that the people of our town

118
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
know that I'm running for office

119
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
and that I care about our children.

120
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Fair enough.

121
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,600
I certainly can print the news.

122
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
And you are now making news.

1
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Here are the fliers, hot off the press!

2
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Looks good.

3
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Simple.

4
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Right over here, Grandpa.

5
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
You fold the fliers.

6
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Richard and I will put them into the envelopes.

7
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
We finished addressing over three hundred envelopes.

8
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Need another box?

9
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Good work, gang.

10
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Hi, this is Mike Johnson.

11
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs. Anderson?

12
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Mr. Nelson.

13
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Hi. This is Robbie Stewart.

14
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Did you know

15
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
my mother is running for the school board?

16
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Yes, Miss Kim, Ellen Stewart.

17
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
"She cares."

18
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Oh, see you at the polls.

19
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Certainly.

20
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
I'll give her your best wishes,

21
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Mr. Nelson. Nelson

22
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Hi, this is Mike Johnson.

23
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs. Burns?

24
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Thank you.

25
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
We have done so much

26
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
in such a short amount of time.

27
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
I can't believe it!

28
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Wait till Philip comes home and sees our progress.

29
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Everyone saw the story in the Riverdale newspaper.

30
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Mr. Maxwell was very kind

31
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
to print my announcement.

32
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
It helps enormously.

33
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Everybody in Riverdale reads his paper.

34
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Your photo in it helped, too.

35
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Thanks to you, Richard,

36
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
it's a good picture.

37
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Well, hi, all.

38
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Hi, Dad.

39
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Hello, darling.

40
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
May I... may I help?

41
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Licking envelopes.

42
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I fold the fliers.

43
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
We stuff them.

44
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,600
And I lick the envelopes.

45
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Hey, everybody,

46
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Mrs. Greenberg is on the phone.

47
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
She says Carter Boswell is on the TV right now -

48
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
doing a commercial.

49
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
What channel?

50
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Five.

51
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,600
And if you ask what I care about, I'll tell you.

52
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,600
I care about the school buildings in need of paint.

53
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
I care about more lockers for the teachers.

54
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,600
I care about new fixtures in the hallways,

55
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
not music or dancing or entertainment.

56
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,600
I care about the practical things.

57
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,600
If you do, vote for me, Carter Boswell.

58
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,600
A lot of people will agree with him.

59
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,600
I told you.

60
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Too bad kids can't vote.

61
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
It's our school, but we can't vote.

62
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,600
There are people in favor of the cultural programs, Mom.

63
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
There are, Ellen.

64
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Don't be upset by Boswell's commercial.

65
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,600
You have to go on television, too.

66
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Boswell's a powerful speaker.

67
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,600
You can be, too.

68
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Your ideas are good ones.

69
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,600
I don't know.

70
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,600
I'm not sure I'm up to it.

1
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,600
My slogan is "I care".

2
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,600
I care about people, not things.

3
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Vote for me, Ellen Stewart.

4
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
I care.

5
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,600
How was it?

6
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
You were terrific!

7
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Can I see it?

8
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Sure.

9
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Hello. My name is Ellen Stewart,

10
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,600
and I'm running for the open seat on the school board.

11
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,600
My slogan is "I care".

12
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,600
What does the word care mean?

13
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,600
I care about people, not things.

14
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Vote for me, Ellen Stewart.

15
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I care.

16
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,600
I like it,

17
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
but now what?

18
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,600
How can we possibly get it on so Riverdale

19
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
will see it and hear it?

20
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Leave it to me.

21
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,600
I mean that when I say "I care",

22
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,600
I care about people, not things.

23
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Vote for me, Ellen Stewart.

24
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
I care.

25
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
What happened?

26
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Mom is now on television

27
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
in every appliance store in Riverdale,

28
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
except Hamlin's.

29
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
He's a Boswell voter.

30
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
That's a brilliant idea, Richard!

31
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
You inherited your father's brains.

32
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,600
We got our brains from you, Dad.

33
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
And guess what?

34
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
I called channel five.

35
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
I called channel five.

36
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Their TV news is going to cover it.

37
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,600
"Housewife campaigns in appliance stores."

38
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
And I'll bet

39
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
some magazine will pick up the story, too.

40
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Mom, you're going to win!

41
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
I know it!

42
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Hold it, Robbie!

43
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Just cool down.

44
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
I know we're getting some attention now,

45
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
but in the end the voters will have to decide.

46
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,600
You're gonna win.

47
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Trust me!

48
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,600
In the hotly contested race

49
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,600
for the one seat on the Riverdale School Board,

50
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Mrs. Ellen Stewart has taken an early lead.

51
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
She's winning!

52
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Mom, you're winning!

53
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Now returning to other local news...

54
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
Riverdale High School Riverdale

55
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
beat its rival Horace Mann in baseball today It's too soon to know for certain.

56
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
It's too soon to know for certain.

57
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
You're ahead.

58
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
That's better than being behind.

59
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
More sports after this.

60
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
It's not over yet.

61
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Let's just all calm down,

62
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
and wait for the final results.

63
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Ellen, why don't you go out to the backyard

64
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
and get some fresh air?

65
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Thank you, Grandpa.

66
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
I need some.

67
00:17:46,600 --> 00:18:08,600
What happened?

68
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:15,600
You came very close, Ellen.

69
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,600
You lost by only a hundred and twenty-one votes.

70
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:28,600
I lost.

71
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
You tried, Mom.

72
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,600
You lost by a very small number of votes.

73
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Only one hundred and twenty-one votes!

74
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
I'm sorry, Mom.

75
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,600
There just wasn't enough time.

76
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Look,

77
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
you've made a very strong impression

78
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
on our community.

79
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,600
You'll have another chance next election.

80
00:18:50,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Hello.

81
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Oh, yes, yes, Mr. Maxwell.

82
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Hello, Mr. Maxwell.

83
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
How are you?

84
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
I just called to tell you

85
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
that you are very impressive.

86
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
You lost the election,

87
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
but you won the attention of the residents of Riverdale,

88
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
of Boswell, and of me.

89
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Well, thank you, Mr. Maxwell.

90
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
I appreciate your kind words.

91
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
I needed that.

92
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
I hear Boswell

93
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
wants to appoint you to a special arts committee.

94
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I'm sending over a reporter

95
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
in the morning to interview you.

96
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
You are?

97
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,600
I'm gonna do an article

98
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
on "Ellen Stewart, she cares".

99
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Maybe we'll all care now.

100
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Good-bye.

101
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Thank you,

102
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
and good-bye.

103
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:07,600
What was that about?

104
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
You were right, Philip.

105
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,600
I did make a difference in town.

106
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
And in this family.
