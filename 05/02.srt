Episode 02 - The Blind Date

1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Excuse me. Can you help me?

2
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Sure, what do you want?

3
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Where is 83 Wooster Street?

4
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's easy. Walk to the corner.

5
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Then make a left turn.

6
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Then walk two blocks to the traffic light.

7
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Make another left to Wooster.

8
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Thank you.

9
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
To the corner and then a left?

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah. A left.

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hot dog? Only seventy-five cents.

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No. Thank you. I have a dinner date.

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:51,000
555-9470... and it's busy.

14
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Try again.

15
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:07,000
555-9470... and it's still busy.

16
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Excuse me, ma'am.

17
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm looking for 83 Wooster Street.

18
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes. Wooster Street is two blocks,

19
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and 83 is to the right, about two houses.

20
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Thank you, thank you!

21
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You're welcome.

22
00:03:33,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Who is it?

23
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Harry Bennett. Is this Susan?

24
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes, it is. Come up.

25
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm on the top floor.

26
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hello, Harry. It's nice to meet you.

27
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Nice to meet you, Susan.

28
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Sorry I'm late.

29
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The traffic. The parking. I was lost.

30
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What pretty flowers! Thank you.

31
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, please come in.

32
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Don't worry about being late. It's fine.

33
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Excuse the mess. I just moved here.

34
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh, I'd like you to meet my sister-in-law Marilyn.

35
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Marilyn Stewart, this is Harry Bennett.

36
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Pleased to meet you.

37
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Nice to meet you, Harry.

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Are we too late for our dinner reservation?

39
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No, the restaurant will hold our table.

40
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I know the owner very well.

41
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I eat there a lot.

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Do you know the phone number of the restaurant?

43
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'd like to call home

44
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and leave the number with the baby-sitter.

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Sure. The number is... five five five... seventeen twenty.

46
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
May I use the phone?

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Five five five...one seven two oh. Hello?

48
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hi, Michelle. It's Daddy.

49
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Can I speak to Betty?

50
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I want to leave the phone number of the restaurant...

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Hi, Betty. I'll be at five five five... seventeen twenty.

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
OK. Thanks. See you later.

53
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, that's done. Shall we go?

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm ready. See you later, Marilyn.

55
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Have a nice evening.

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Bye, Marilyn. Hope to see you again.

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Me, too. Have fun!

58
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Thanks.

59
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
After you.

1
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Ah! Miss Stewart! Welcome!

2
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
How are you?

3
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Fine, Somsak. And you?

4
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Fine, thank you.

5
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
This is my friend Harry Bennett.

6
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Pleased to meet you.

7
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Very nice to meet you.

8
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Any friend of Miss Stewart's is welcome at Somsak's.

9
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Follow me, please.

10
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
I like it here.

11
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,600
I do, too. I come here often.

12
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,600
A special place for special people.

13
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Thank you, Somsak.

14
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Well! Nice restaurant.

15
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Would you like something to drink?

16
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Yes, I'd like a glass of ginger ale with ice.

17
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Harry, what would you like?

18
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Do you have a dry white wine?

19
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
How about a California chablis?

20
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Chablis is fine.

21
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
What would you like to eat?

22
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I'd like the mee krob.

23
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Harry, would you like to see a menu?

24
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
No, it's Ok.

25
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
I'll have the mee krob also.

26
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
What is it?

27
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Crispy fried noodles. I love them.

28
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
May I bring you a salad?

29
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Oh yes.

30
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
What do you recommend today?

31
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
I recommend rose-petal salad.

32
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Special for new friends.

33
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Rose-petal salad?

34
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Why not?

35
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
I'll take care of everything.

36
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,600
I hope you're hungry.

37
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,600
What? Oh, yes. Starving. Well, I...

38
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Well, I...

39
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,600
What do you do at Universe Toy Company?

40
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,600
I'm the vice-president of new toy development.

41
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Terrific!

42
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,600
I know you're a CPA.

43
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
That's true. Harry Bennett,

44
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
certified public accountant.

45
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
I love numbers.

46
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
I do some work for Smith and Dale,

47
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Your company's accounting firm.

48
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
And so...

49
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Here we are.

50
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Yes.

51
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
I have a daughter.

52
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
I know. How old is she?

53
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
She's nine years old.

54
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
That's a nice age. What's her name?

55
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Michelle.

56
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Do you have a picture of her?

57
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:23,600
She's very pretty.

58
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Thank you.

59
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Rose-petal salad.

60
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,600
And there's a phone call for you, Mr. Bennett.

61
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Excuse me, Susan.

62
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,600
I hope nothing is wrong.

63
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
I'll get the rest of the dinner.

64
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Excuse me.

65
00:11:45,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Please forgive me, Susan, but...

66
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,600
I have to leave. I feel terrible, but...

67
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
What's the matter?

68
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,600
My daughter isn't feeling well.

69
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Oh no! Is it serious?

70
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,600
I don't know. The baby-sitter says she has a stomachache,

71
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
and she's crying.

72
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
I'll have to go home.

73
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Will you forgive me?

74
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Of course. I'm so sorry for Michelle.

75
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600
And you didn't have a chance to eat.

76
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Oh, it's OK.

77
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Let me take you home first.

78
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
No, no. Please, go ahead.

79
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
It's our first date.

80
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
We'll make another.

81
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Please don't worry.

82
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,600
I'll phone you.

83
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,600
I hope your daughter is all right. Good-bye.

84
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Good-bye.

1
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
What happened?

2
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,600
The baby-sitter called.

3
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
His daughter is sick.

4
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
What's wrong?

5
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
I think she has a stomachache.

6
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,600
He's a good father.

7
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,600
So... what do you think of him?

8
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,600
He's very nice.

9
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,600
But I think he was nervous tonight.

10
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,600
It was his first date in two years.

11
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Will you see him again?

12
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I hope so.

13
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,600
This food is delicious.

14
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,600
He didn't get a thing to eat.

15
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
You ordered enough for three or four people,

16
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
but I'm not complaining.

17
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
The food is delicious.

18
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Who is that?

19
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Do you think it's...

20
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:05,600
No. You won't believe it, Marilyn!

21
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
I believe it. Even without looking.

22
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Hi!

23
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
How...?

24
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Your downstairs neighbor let me in.

25
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Did you go home?

26
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
I did , but everything is OK,

27
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
so I decided to come back.

28
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,600
To apologize for leaving so early,

29
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
I brought you a little gift.

30
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,600
It's a bonsai tree

31
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,600
Hi, Marilyn. I hope it's not too late.

32
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
Oh, not at all. We're still eating.

33
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Please, come in. Join us.

34
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
It's our meal from the restaurant.

35
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,600
And how is your daughter?

36
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Oh, she's fine.

37
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,600
It's good that you went back.

38
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,600
Yes, I think it's important for me to be there

39
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
since her mother died.

40
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,600
I agree. Aren't you hungry?

41
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,600
As a matter of fact... I am hungry.

42
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
There's lots of food left.

43
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Mmm, this is delicious!

44
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Enjoy!

45
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,600
I'm going to excuse myself.

46
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,600
I have a lot of work to do to get ready for tomorrow.

47
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Good night, Harry. It was nice meeting you.

48
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Bye, Marilyn.

49
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Good night, Susan.

50
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Good night, Marilyn.

51
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,600
She's going to a fashion show here in the city tomorrow.

52
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
She is sleeping here

53
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,600
so she won't have to travel from Riverdale in the morning.

54
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
You two must be close.

55
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,600
we are.

56
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
The whole Stewart family is close.

57
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
I like that.

58
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:49,600
And then, two years ago, my wife died.

59
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
You miss her.

60
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,600
I do... yes, but I have Michelle...

61
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
and with time...

62
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Is there anyone else in your life?

63
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,600
No, not yet. What about you?

64
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Oh, I date occasionally,

65
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
but my work keeps me busy.

66
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Ooh, speaking of keeping busy,

67
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
I have an early start tomorrow,

68
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
and the baby-sitter has to get home.

69
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Where did the time go?

70
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
It's midnight.

71
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Thank you, Susan.

72
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
I had a nice evening.

73
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Me, too, Harry. Harry?

74
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Yes?

75
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,600
I'd like to meet your daughter someday.

76
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Does that mean that I can see you again?

77
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Of course.

78
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Wonderful. I'll call you,

79
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
and we'll go out to dinner.

80
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Please do.

81
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
I promise I won't leave early.

82
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,600
It was for a good reason.

83
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
You know something?

84
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
What?

85
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
I think we're going to be good friends.

86
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Good night, Susan.

87
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Good night, Harry.

88
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Have a safe trip home.

89
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Are you all right?

90
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Sorry.

91
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,600
I never liked that umbrella stand.

92
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Good night, Harry.
