00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Excuse me. Can you help me?

2
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Sure, what do you want?

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Where is 83 Wooster Street? Wooster

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's easy. Walk to the corner.

5
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Then make a left turn.

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Then walk two blocks to the traffic light.

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Make another left to Wooster.

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thank you.

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
To the corner and then a left?

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah. A left.

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hot dog? Only seventy-five cents.

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No. Thank you. I have a dinner date.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:36,000
555-9470...and it's busy.... 555-9470

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Try again.

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:52,000
555-9470...and it's still busy. 555-9470

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Excuse me, ma'am.

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm looking for 83 Wooster Street.

18
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes. Wooster Street is two blocks,

19
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and 83 is to the right, about two houses. 83

20
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you, thank you!

21
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You're welcome.

22
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Who is it?

23
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Harry Bennett. Is this Susan? Harry Bennett

24
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes, it is. Come up.

25
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm on the top floor.

26
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hello, Harry. It's nice to meet you.

27
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Nice to meet you, Susan.

28
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Sorry I'm late.

29
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The traffic. The parking. I was lost.

30
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What pretty flowers! Thank you.

31
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, please come in.

32
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't worry about being late. It's fine.

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Excuse the mess. I just moved here.

34
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh, I'd like you to meet my sister-in-law Marilyn.

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Marilyn Stewart, this is Harry Bennett. Marilyn Stewart

Nice to meet you, Harry.

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Are we too late for our dinner reservation?

39
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No, the restaurant will hold our table.

40
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I know the owner very well.

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I eat there a lot.

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Do you know the phone number of the restaurant?

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'd like to call home

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and leave the number with the baby-sitter.

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Sure. The number is... five five five...seventeen twenty.

46
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
May I use the phone?

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Five five five...one seven two oh. Hello? 555-1720

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Hi, Michelle. It's Daddy.

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Can I speak to Betty?

50
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I want to leave the phone number of the restaurant....

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hi, Betty. I'll be at five five five...seventeen twenty.

52
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
OK. Thanks. See you later.

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Well, that's done. Shall we go?

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm ready. See you later, Marilyn.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Have a nice evening.

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Bye, Marilyn. Hope to see you again.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Me, too. Have fun!

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Thanks.

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
After you.

1
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Ah! Miss Stewart! Welcome!

2
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
How are you?

3
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Fine, Somsak. And you?

4
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Fine, thank you.

5
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
This is my friend Harry Bennett.

6
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Pleased to meet you.

7
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Very nice to meet you.

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Any friend of Miss Stewart's is welcome at Somsak's. Stewart

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Follow me, please.

10
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
I like it here.

11
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,100
I do, too. I come here often.

12
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,100
A special place for special people.

13
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
Thank you, Somsak.

14
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:37,100
Well! Nice restaurant.

15
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,100
Would you like something to drink?

16
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Yes, I'd like a glass of ginger ale with ice.

17
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Harry, what would you like? Harry

18
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,100
Do you have a dry white wine?

19
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,100
How about a California chablis?

20
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Chablis is fine.

21
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,100
What would you like to eat?

22
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,100
I'd like the mee krob.

23
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Harry, would you like to see a menu? Harry

24
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,100
No, it's Ok.

25
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,100
I'll have the mee krob also.

26
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,100
What is it?

27
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,100
Crispy fried noodles. I love them.

28
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,100
May I bring you a salad?

29
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,100
Oh yes.

30
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
What do you recommend today?

31
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
I recommend rose-petal salad.

32
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Special for new friends.

33
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Rose-petal salad?

34
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,100
Why not?

35
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
I'll take care of everything.

36
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:29,100
I hope you're hungry.

37
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,100
What? Oh, yes. Starving. Well, I...

38
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Well, I ...

39
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:43,100
What do you do at Universe Toy Company?

40
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,100
I'm the vice-president of new toy development.

41
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,100
Terrific!

42
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,100
I know you 're a CPA.

43
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
That's true. Harry Bennett,

44
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
certified public accountant.

45
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
I love numbers.

46
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
I do some work for Smith and Dale,

47
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Your company's accounting firm.

48
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,100
And so...

49
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Here we are.

50
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Yes.

51
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,100
I have a daughter.

52
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
I know. How old is she?

53
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
She's nine years old.

54
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,100
That's a nice age. What's her name?

55
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,100
Michelle. Michelle

56
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,100
Do you have a picture of her?

57
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:29,100
She's very pretty.

58
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,100
Thank you.

59
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:39,100
Rose-petal salad.

60
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,100
And there's a phone call for you, Mr. Bennett. Bennett

61
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Excuse me, Susan.

62
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,100
I hope nothing is wrong.

63
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
I'll get the rest of the dinner.

64
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Excuse me.

65
00:11:51,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Please forgive me, Susan, but...

66
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
I have to leave. I feel terrible, but...

67
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,100
What's the matter?

68
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,100
My daughter isn't feeling well.

69
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100
Oh no! Is it serious?

70
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,100
I don't know. The baby-sitter says she has a stomachache,

71
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,100
and she's crying.

72
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,100
I'll have to go home.

73
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
Will you forgive me?

74
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,100
Of course. I'm so sorry for Michelle.

75
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,100
And you didn't have a chance to eat.

76
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
Oh, it's OK.

77
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Let me take you home first.

78
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
No, no. Please, go ahead.

79
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,100
It's our first date.

80
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,100
We'll make another.

81
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,100
Please don't worry.

82
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,100
I'll phone you.

83
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,100
I hope your daughter is all right. Good-bye.

84
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,100
Good-bye.

1
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,100
What happened?

2
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,100
The baby-sitter called.

3
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,100
His daughter is sick.

4
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
What's wrong?

5
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
I think she has a stomachache.

6
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,100
He's a good father.

7
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:43,100
So... what do you think of him?

8
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,100
He's very nice.

9
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,100
But I think he was nervous tonight.

10
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,100
It was his first date in two years.

11
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,100
Will you see him again?

12
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,100
I hope so.

13
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,100
This food is delicious.

14
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,100
He didn't get a thing to eat.

15
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,100
You ordered enough for three or four people,

16
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
but I'm not complaining.

17
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
The food is delicious.

18
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,100
Who is that?

19
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Do you think it's...

20
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:29,100
No. You won't believe it, Marilyn!

21
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,100
I believe it. Even without looking.

22
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Hi!

23
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
How...?

24
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Your downstairs neighbor let me in.

25
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Did you go home?

26
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,100
I did , but everything is OK,

27
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
so I decided to come back.

28
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,100
To apologize for leaving so early,

29
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
I brought you a little gift.

30
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,100
It's a bonsai tree

31
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,100
Hi, Marilyn. I hope it's not too late.

32
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Oh, not at all. We're still eating.

33
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,100
Please, come in. Join us.

34
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
It's our meal from the restaurant.

35
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,100
And how is your daughter?

36
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Oh, she's fine.

37
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,100
It's good that you went back.

38
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,100
Yes, I think it's important for me to be there

39
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
since her mother died.

40
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,100
I agree. Aren't you hungry?

41
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,100
As a matter of fact... I am hungry.

42
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
There's lots of food left.

43
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,100
Mmm, this is delicious!

44
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Enjoy!

45
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,100
I'm going to excuse myself.

46
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,100
I have a lot of work to do to get ready for tomorrow.

47
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,100
Good night, Harry. It was nice meeting you. Harry

48
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,100
Bye, Marilyn.

49
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Good night, Susan.

50
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Good night, Marilyn.

51
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,100
She's going to a fashion show here in the city tomorrow.

52
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
She is sleeping here

53
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,100
so she won't have to travel from Riverdale in the morning.

54
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
You two must be close.

55
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,100
we are.

56
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,100
The whole Stewart family is close. Stewart

57
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,100
I like that.

58
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:13,100
And then, two years ago, my wife died.

59
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
You miss her.

60
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:20,100
I do...yes, but I have Michelle...

61
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,100
and with time...

62
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,100
Is there anyone else in your life?

63
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,100
No, not yet. What about you?

64
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,100
Oh, I date occasionally,

65
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,100
but my work keeps me busy.

66
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Ooh, speaking of keeping busy-

67
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,100
I have an early start tomorrow,

68
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
and the baby-sitter has to get home.

69
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,100
Where did the time go?

70
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
It's midnight.

71
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:54,100
Thank you, Susan.

72
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
I had a nice evening.

73
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:08,100
Me, too, Harry. Harry?

74
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Yes?

75
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,100
I'd like to meet your daughter someday.

76
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,100
Does that mean that I can see you again?

77
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
Of course.

78
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Wonderful. I'll call you,

79
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,100
and we'll go out to dinner.

80
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,100
Please do.

81
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,100
I promise I won't leave early.

82
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,100
It was for a good reason.

83
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
You know something?

84
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,100
What?

85
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,100
I think we're going to be good friends.

86
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,100
Good night, Susan.

87
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,100
Good night, Harry,

88
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,100
Have a safe trip home.

89
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:47,100
Are you all right?

90
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,100
Sorry.

91
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:55,100
I never liked that umbrella stand.

92
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,100
Good night, Harry.
