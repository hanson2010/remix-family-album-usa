Episode 22 - Career Choices

1
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,600
"Rock-a-bye, baby, on the tree top,

2
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,600
When the wind blows,

3
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,600
The cradle will rock.

4
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
When the bough breaks,

5
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,600
The cradle will fall,

6
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,600
And down will come baby,

7
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Cradle and all."

8
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Hi, Marilyn,

9
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
What are you doing?

10
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Just sketching.

11
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I've been thinking a lot about our responsibilities

12
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
in the past few weeks.

13
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
I never stop thinking about them.

14
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
I've been wrestling

15
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,600
with the question of whether I go back to work or not.

16
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I see.

17
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
And I'm torn.

18
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
I really want to go back to work,

19
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
use my talents,

20
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
and pursue my career in fashion design

21
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
like we always thought I would.

22
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
But now...

23
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
I want to be with Max as a full-time mother,

24
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
especially when he's a baby.

25
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
I really understand, Marilyn.

26
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
But you never have to worry about Max.

27
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
There's Mother and Grandpa...

28
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
and I can always arrange my photo schedule

29
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
around your schedule,

30
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
if that will help.

31
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,600
It's not the same, Richard.

32
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Have you discussed going back to work with your boss?

33
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Rita Mae called yesterday. Rita Mae

34
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Ah! That's what's got you thinking, isn't it?

35
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
She wants to know

36
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
when I think I'll be returning to the boutique.

37
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
And you said...?

38
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
I said I'd give her an answer in a few days ...

39
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,600
that I wasn't sure.

40
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I'm sure Rita Mae will understand

41
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
and wait until you're ready to go back to work.

42
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, maybe she will, and maybe she won't.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Who knows?

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,600
If I don't accept her offer,

45
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
maybe she'll find someone else in the meantime,

46
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
and when I'm ready to go back,

47
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
there won't be a job for me.

48
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
That's something to consider.

49
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
You've got yourself to think about, too.

50
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
But I am thinking about myself.

51
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Don't you see?

52
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
What do you mean?

53
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
It's not just the job.

54
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:34,600
It's also my career as Max's mother.

55
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
That's the way I look at it.

56
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I have two career opportunities at the same time.

57
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
My career as a fashion designer

58
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
and my career as a mother.

59
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,600
I never really thought about being a mother as a career.

60
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,600
I guess you do have two career opportunities

61
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,600
and a decision to make.

62
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,600
I hear Max.

63
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
I'll do it.

1
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,600
There's your teddy bear, Max.

2
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,600
He just loves that teddy bear

3
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
that Grandpa Philip bought for him.

4
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I took him to Philip's office yesterday for a checkup.

5
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,600
You should have seen the look on his face

6
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,600
when Molly gave him the injection. Molly

7
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Oh, did he cry?

8
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
No.

9
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,600
My dear little boy just looked up at me as if to say,

10
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,600
"Mama, what are they doing to me? Help!"

11
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
How did you feel?

12
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Tell the truth.

13
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Didn't you feel terrible?

14
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
I sure did.

15
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,600
I held him closely.

16
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,600
I kissed the top of his dear little head.

17
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,600
He looked up at me.

18
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
He tried to smile.

19
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Being with him helped.

20
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Helped him?

21
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Or helped you?

22
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Being a mother is not easy,

23
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
if that's what you mean.

24
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Speaking of being a mother,

25
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,600
I've been meaning to ask you

26
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,600
what you were thinking about regarding going back to work.

27
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,600
I know Rita Mae called.

28
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
I can imagine what is going through your head.

29
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
I'm sure you can, Ellen.

30
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
There are so many things to consider.

31
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,600
One thing that makes it easier for you

32
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
is that you have us.

33
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Max will always have a family member to watch over him

34
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
while you're at work.

35
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,600
I didn't have that when Richard and Susan were born.

36
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
What did you do?

37
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,600
I chose to continue with my career as a music teacher.

38
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,600
We hired a woman to watch Richard and then Susan,

39
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,600
and I continued with my career.

40
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Do you think you made the right decision?

41
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I think I did.

42
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
But when Robbie was born,

43
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
I decided to give full-time attention to raising Robbie.

44
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
I felt differently at that time.

45
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
And you gave up your career as a music teacher?

46
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Not exactly.

47
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,600
I continued to teach piano lessons at home.

48
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,600
How did you feel about being away

49
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,600
when Susan and Richard were babies?

50
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,600
I think I did the right thing

51
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,600
for them and for myself and for Philip.

52
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
We needed the money.

53
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Well, we do too, Ellen.

54
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Everything I earn helps us towards getting that house

55
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
we want and need.

56
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,600
I can't wait till he's just a little older.

57
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Our toy company makes the most wonderful toys for kids.

58
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Max thanks you.

59
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
I thank you.

60
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
And Richard thanks you.

61
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Now may I please say hello?

62
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Hello.

63
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Hello.

64
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,600
I miss Max and think about him all week long.

65
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,600
We talk about him at dinnertime.

66
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Will you please try to relax?

67
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
I've never seen you so wound up.

68
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,600
You seem to be enjoying the pressure.

69
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
The truth is, I am.

70
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
My job is not an easy one,

71
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
but I really enjoy it.

72
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,600
That is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, Susan.

73
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
What's the problem?

74
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Marilyn's career.

75
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Well, my choice of careers.

76
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Choice?

77
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,600
My career as a fashion designer

78
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
versus my career as a mother.

79
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Why does it have to be one or the other?

80
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
That's what I said.

81
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
How's that?

82
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Why can't you do both?

83
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
She's right.

84
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Both?

85
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Well, that's what I do.

86
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,600
I have a job, and I have Michelle.

87
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
I take care of both to the best of my ability.

88
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,600
It's not easy, but what is?

89
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
And that's what I did.

90
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
I did both with Richard and Susan,

91
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
and I did both with Robbie.

92
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I thought you stayed home with Robbie?

93
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
I did.

94
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
But I was lucky enough to have a career as a music teacher

95
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
which I could continue at home.

96
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Why can't you work at home, Marilyn?

97
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
You're very talented.

98
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Designing dresses is a career

99
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
you could establish out of your home,

100
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
couldn't you?

101
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,600
I don't know why I didn't think of it.

102
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
It seems so simple now.

103
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
For a year or two

104
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,600
I could stay at home with Max and do my dress designs.

105
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,600
And you could make your dresses at home.

106
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Sounds like a great way to solve the problem.

107
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,600
That could solve your problem, Marilyn.

108
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,600
I'm going to call Rita Mae at home

109
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
and ask her to come by and talk about it.

110
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,600
She wants to see Max, anyway.

111
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,600
I think that really answers your questions, Marilyn.

112
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
You can do it.

113
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Do your designs at home - here.

114
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,600
And let Rita Mae do the selling at the boutique.

115
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,600
And you can both benefit financially.

116
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
I'm going to call Rita Mae right now.

117
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Oh, Susan, thank you so much

118
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,600
for coming all this way from the city to talk to me about it.

119
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I hope you don't mind

120
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
having taken so much time away from your busy schedule.

121
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Are you kidding?

122
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
I don't mind at all.

123
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
As a matter of fact,

124
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,600
I came to spend some time with my favorite nephew.

125
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
I think you should call Rita Mae right now.

126
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I think your idea of working at home is perfect.

127
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
I don't know what I would do without you.

128
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,600
I'm lucky to have you all.

129
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,600
We are lucky to have you, Marilyn.

130
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
And so is Max.

1
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Hi, big guy.

2
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
That must be Rita Mae.

3
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
She sure got here quickly.

4
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
That's a good sign.

5
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
She must like you and your work, Marilyn.

6
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
I think she's just anxious to see Max.

7
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
She loves children.

8
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Hi, Marilyn.

9
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Welcome.

10
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
It's so nice of you to come.

11
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Oh, I just wanted to see your baby, Max.

12
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Hello, Rita Mae.

13
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
I haven't seen you since the hospital.

14
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,600
I'm Ellen Stewart, Marilyn's mother-in-law.

15
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
We met at the hospital.

16
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
How are you?

17
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
How are you?

18
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Oh, and there is Max!

19
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Oh! My, how he's grown!

20
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,600
A little present for Max.

21
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Oh, it's beautiful, Rita Mae!

22
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
You shouldn't have.

23
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
It's nothing.

24
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
It's just a little present for Max.

25
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Can I get you some coffee or tea or a cold drink, Rita Mae?

26
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Oh, nothing, thank you.

27
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Well, I will leave you two to talk.

28
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Come on, you big guy.

29
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Yes, come on.

30
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
That's it.

31
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
It's nice seeing you.

32
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Let me know if you need anything.

33
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Thanks, Ellen.

34
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Thanks, Ellen.

35
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,600
OK, Marilyn.

36
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
You sounded like you've made a decision

37
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
when you called me.

38
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,600
I have made a decision, Rita Mae.

39
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
I've decided to stay at home and be a full-time mother.

40
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,600
I'm disappointed, but I respect your decision.

41
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,600
If I had a child as cute as Max,

42
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
I might do the same thing.

43
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
But I haven't finished telling you

44
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
the other half of my decision.

45
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
The other half?

46
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Yes.

47
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
I think I can stay at home

48
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,600
and take care of Max and continue my career.

49
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Sounds interesting.

50
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Let me hear it.

51
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Do you remember

52
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
our talks about custom-designed dresses for the boutique?

53
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
I sure do.

54
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Why can't I design dresses for you here at home?

55
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,000
And make them here.

56
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,900
Have the fittings here, too.

57
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,000
And I could do the selling and the pricing at the boutique.

58
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,600
Exactly.

59
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Oh!

60
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
What kind of dresses would you design?

61
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,600
I've thought about that for some time.

62
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Yes?

63
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Wedding dresses.

64
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Wedding dresses?

65
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Brilliant idea!

66
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,600
There's a big market today in wedding dresses.

67
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
That's what I thought.

68
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
I like the idea very much.

69
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
And if it's successful,

70
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
we can expand to all kinds of dresses.

71
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
That's what I thought.

72
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
As a matter of fact,

73
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,600
I have a customer for your first wedding dress.

74
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
My niece is getting married,

75
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,600
and I've been trying to find just the right thing for her.

76
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Marilyn, you're going to design my niece's dress. Marilyn

77
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
That'll be our first one,

78
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
and then we'll use it to sell others.

79
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Do you really mean it?

80
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
I really mean it.

81
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
It's a simple idea, and it will work.

82
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,600
You can certainly design dresses.

83
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
I know that.

84
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,600
And there's no reason why you can't do it from your home.

85
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
I'm so excited!

86
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
I can't wait to tell Richard!

87
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,600
If I had a baby like Max,

88
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,600
I'd want to stay home and be near him all the time, too.

89
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,600
You're making the right decision

90
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
for Max and for yourself too, Marilyn.

91
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
It all sounds so easy.

92
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Now the hard work begins.

93
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Would you like

94
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,600
to see some of my designs that I've been working on?

95
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
I'd love to.

96
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:28,600
Ooh! Oh, that's wonderful!

97
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Ooh...
