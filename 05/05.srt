Episode 05 - The Right Magic

1
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Hi, Grandpa.

2
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Hi, Robbie.

3
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Can I help?

4
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Yes, indeed.

5
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Hand me two eggs from the refrigerator,

6
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,600
and I'll make you two fried eggs.

7
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,600
How about some bacon?

8
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
I made enough for an army.

9
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,600
You going to the baseball game today?

10
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,600
It's a perfect day for it--a little cloudy but nice and warm.

11
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Dad and I were planning to go to the game,

12
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
but he has to work today,

13
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
and my friends don't want to go.

14
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
It's not an important game, anyway.

15
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Do you have any other plans for the day?

16
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
I'll work on my computer.

17
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,600
I have a new math program, and I want to learn how to use it.

18
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Maybe you can teach me

19
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
how to work on a computer someday.

20
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Anytime. It's really easy, but, like anything,

21
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
you need to work at it, Grandpa.

22
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,600
This bacon is great.

23
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
I love crispy bacon.

24
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Oh, what are you doing tomorrow?

25
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Nothing much.

26
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Well, maybe your dad and I could take you fishing with us.

27
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
I'd like that, but ...

28
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
But what?

29
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
But Dad is always so busy.

30
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Well, can you come fishing with me tomorrow?

31
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Sure, I can.

32
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Robbie says you can't take him to the game today. Robbie

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
I really feel bad about it,

34
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
but they need me at the hospital today,

35
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
in the children's ward.

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
I understand.

37
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Maybe we can spend some time together next weekend.

38
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Definitely.

39
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
We should.

40
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
You and Robbie and me.

41
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Remember our first fishing trip?

42
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
I sure do....

43
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Well, I've got to run, Dad.

44
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
See you later.

45
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Going fishing?

46
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
I'm thinking about it....

47
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,600
So, how's work?

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Oh, the usual problems.

49
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,600
You're working pretty hard these days.

50
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
I guess I am.

51
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:10,600
When did you last go fishing with Robbie?

52
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
I remember exactly.

53
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,600
It was on his birthday, June second, two years ago.

54
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,600
We didn't catch anything.

55
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Remember our fishing trips?

56
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Yes. I loved them.

57
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Remember catching your first fish?

58
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
How can I forget?

59
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
I fell out of the boat!

60
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,600
We had some good times together.

61
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Yes, we did.

62
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Maybe we should do it again.

63
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,600
How about tomorrow?

64
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Don't you have to work?

65
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
My paper work will wait.

66
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Oh, Robbie will be thrilled.

67
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
I am, too, Son.

68
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
I want to spend more time with Robbie.

69
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Tomorrow.

70
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,600
It'll be like old times for you and me.

71
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
And Robbie will love it. Robbie

72
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Well, what's the weather going to be like?

73
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Radio says sunny and mild.

74
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Well, I'll tell Robbie.

75
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,600
And thanks, Dad.

76
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Don't thank me.

77
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,600
I'm just being a grandfather.

1
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,100
This is really neat!

2
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,100
When do we eat?

3
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,100
First, we have to catch some fish.

4
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:10,100
In order to catch fish, you have to do this.

5
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Here we go.

6
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
That's it.

7
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Then drop it into the water.

8
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,100
All of this comes before eating. OK?

9
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,100
How do you know so much about fishing?

10
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
Grandpa taught me.

11
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
We spent a lot of time fishing together.

12
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Now, the important thing is to get the hook close to the fish.

13
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
All right?

14
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Like this.

15
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:55,100
I think I see some fish right under us, Dad.

16
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,100
Oh, not a chance!

17
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,100
I just saw a big one!

18
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
Hi, there!

19
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
Hi.

20
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,100
What's your name?

21
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Albert. Albert

22
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Are you all alone?

23
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
Yes, sir.

24
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,100
How old are you, Albert?

25
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,100
I'm ten.

26
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,100
Where's your father?

27
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
He's up there at the lodge.

28
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Does he know you're here?

29
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
Yes, sir.

30
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,100
OK, Robbie, maybe you should watch him. Robbie

31
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,100
The water's pretty deep here.

32
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
I'll watch him, Dad.

33
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:37,100
What time is it?

34
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,100
It's almost lunchtime, and no fish yet.

35
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,100
I can go up to the lodge for some hot dogs and drinks.

36
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,100
No way!

37
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
We're here to catch our lunch.

38
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,100
To catch fish, you need the right magic.

39
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,100
That's right.

40
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,100
I forgot!

41
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
The right magic.

42
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
Do it for Robbie, Dad.

43
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,100
You remember?

44
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,100
Sure. Come on.

45
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,100
Well, first, you have to turn your hat around like this.

46
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,100
Then you close your eyes and say the magic words.

47
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,100
Fish, fish, send me a fish.

48
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Fish, fish, send me a fish.... I got one!

49
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,100
See, it works!

50
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,100
It's a big one!

51
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,100
Well, it always worked for me, too.

52
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,100
Grandpa, get the net, please!

53
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:42,100
Dad, you got one, too!

54
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,100
You bet I have!

55
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,100
Easy, Philip, easy.

56
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Sorry, Dad.

57
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,100
Well, one more and I've got a pair of boots.

58
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,100
You didn't say the magic words.

59
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Robbie's right. Robbie

60
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
Yes, but you did, and we've got our lunch.

61
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Let's build a fire and cook it!

62
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Come on, Albert, you can help us!

63
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
I want to stay here and fish.

64
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,100
All right, but be careful.

65
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:24,100
Is it finished yet?

66
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,100
I think so.

67
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,100
I hope you like your fish well done.

68
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Burned, you mean.

69
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Hey, I'm a doctor, not a chef.

70
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:47,100
Help! Help! I can't swim!

71
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Dad! Grandpa! He fell in!

72
00:12:49,100 --> 00:13:10,100
Easy does it, Robbie.

73
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
That a boy.

74
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
That's it.

75
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,100
He's not breathing, Philip!

76
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
Robbie, run to the car! Robbie

77
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,100
Bring a blanket and my medical bag.

78
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,100
Yes, Dad.

79
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,100
Now, come on, son. Come on, son.

80
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,100
Breathe, Albert!

1
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Here's the bag.

2
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,100
Will he be OK, Dad?

3
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,100
I hope so.

4
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:08,100
That's it.

5
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,100
That's the way.

6
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
That's it. There.

7
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,100
Oh, it's going to be all right.

8
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,100
That's it.

9
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
Wrap him in the blanket, Dad!

10
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,100
That's it. That's it.

11
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
It's all right, Albert.

12
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,100
You're going to be OK.

13
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,100
I want my daddy!

14
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,100
We'll take you to him.

15
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,100
Easy now. Easy does it. That's it.

16
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Your dad is quite a guy.

17
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
I know, Grandpa.

18
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
How is he, Philip?

19
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
He's asleep.

20
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
He's going to be fine.

21
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
How can I thank all of you?

22
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,100
Thank my son Robbie.

23
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,100
He pulled him out of the water.

24
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
I'm very grateful, Robbie.

25
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
Dad saved him, not me.

26
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
I'm so thankful to all of you.

27
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,100
So long.

28
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,100
He's a lucky boy.

29
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Well, what do you say we get back to our fishing?

30
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
That's a great idea.

31
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,100
Uh-oh. It's probably the hospital.

32
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,100
I have to get to a phone.

33
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,100
It probably means we can't stay.

34
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,100
That's OK.

35
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:23,100
One of my patients has a high fever,

36
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
and I have to go to the hospital.

37
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
I'm sorry, Robbie.

38
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
I guess I ruined your day.

39
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,100
You didn't ruin my day, Dad.

40
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:38,100
I understand. I really do.

41
00:16:38,100 --> 00:17:06,100
Why are you back so early?

42
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,100
Philip had to go back to the hospital. Philip

43
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,100
He had an emergency.

44
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
Oh, that's too bad, Robbie.

45
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,100
Did it spoil your fun?

46
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,100
No, Mom. We had a great time.

47
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
Well, did you do any fishing?

48
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,100
Yeah, we caught lots of them. Look!

49
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:27,100
They had a special on frozen fish down at the supermarket.

50
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,100
Oh, you really had a bad day.

51
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
We had a good day.

52
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,100
Robbie pulled a boy out of the water. Robbie

53
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
And Dad saved his life.

54
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
He's a terrific doctor, Mom.

55
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
I know.

56
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:57,100
Hi, Pop. Hi, Son.

57
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,100
Hello, Dad.

58
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,100
What a day!

59
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
How about a cup of coffee, Son?

60
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
I'd love a cup of coffee.

61
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:13,100
How was the patient?

62
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,100
She'll be fine.

63
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Was it serious?

64
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
No.

65
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,100
Until today, I was never really interested in medicine.

66
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,100
Well, it's hard work.

67
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,100
Now I know.

68
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,100
I had a good time today, Robbie.

69
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,100
Me, too.

70
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Why don't we do it again?

71
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Can we? When?

72
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
How about next Saturday?

73
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,100
Won't you be busy?

74
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,100
I'm changing my schedule.

75
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Well, do we have a date?

76
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,100
We sure do, Dad.

77
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,100
Grandpa, can you come?

78
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
I have other plans, Robbie.

79
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:01,100
But I think you two can have a good time together without me.

80
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:08,100
No, Dad, and certainly not without the right magic.
