Episode 19 - I Do

1
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,600
It looks wrong.

2
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Hmmm. It is wrong.

3
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Are they always that difficult to make?

4
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,600
The truth is... yes.

5
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
I'll try again.

6
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
At this rate,

7
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
the wedding will take place tomorrow.

8
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Not to worry.

9
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
OK. Here we go.

10
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:49,600
I'm worried, Philip.

11
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
What if we can't tie the tie?

12
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
If we can't tie the tie,

13
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
then there can't be a wedding.

14
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
You'd better not make Harry

15
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
any more nervous than he is.

16
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Don't worry.

17
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
We'll figure a way.

18
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
How're you doing, fellas?

19
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Not so good, Grandpa.

20
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
We can't get this bow tie tied.

21
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Nobody knows how to do it.

22
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Do you?

23
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
No. I never could, either.

24
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Well, you have your own tuxedo.

25
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
How do you tie your bow tie?

26
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Yeah, Grandpa,

27
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I've seen you in it.

28
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
You look great.

29
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
How do you tie it?

30
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
I don't.

31
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
What do you mean?

32
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,600
I never could tie one of those...

33
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
things... bow ties.

34
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,600
I have always worn a clip-on bow tie.

35
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
A clip-on?

36
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Of course.

37
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Now I remember.

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Yes, it's so easy.

39
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
All you do is

40
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
clip it around under your collar.

41
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
We all need one of those.

42
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
The tuxedo rental store.

43
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Do you think they're open?

44
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Should be.

45
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Sunday's their big day.

46
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
I'll call and find out.

47
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Well, if they're not,

48
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I'll lend you mine, Harry.

49
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
You're the only one

50
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
who really needs to be wearing a tuxedo,

51
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Thanks, Grandpa.

52
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
I'm the father of the bride.

53
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
I'm supposed to be worried about my daughter,

54
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
and here I am with

55
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
the man that's marrying my daughter

56
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
worrying about him.

57
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Poor Harry.

58
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I know the feeling.

59
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Wedding-day Jitters.

60
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Are they open?

61
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
We're in luck.

62
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
They're open.

63
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
And they have lots of clip-on bow ties.

64
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
I'll bicycle down to the village and get them.

65
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
You'd better hurry, Robbie.

66
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
There's lots of time.

67
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
A little over two hours.

68
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,600
In two hours and fifteen minutes

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
I'll be married to Susan.

70
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
And be a true member of the Stewart family.

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Oh, you're a lucky guy, Harry.

72
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Susan is one of the best women you'll ever find.

73
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
She's just like her grandma.

74
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Now, once you put the ring on Susan's finger,

75
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
you are one of us, Harry.

76
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
And don't ever forget it.

77
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Ring? Ring?

78
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Oh my!

79
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
What did I do with the rings?

80
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,600
I put them in the pocket of my sports jacket.

81
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
No,

82
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
I think you put them

83
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
in your tuxedo jacket pocket.

84
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Remember?

85
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Right.

86
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,600
What did I do with the rings?

87
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Didn't you give them to Richard?

88
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
He's your best man.

89
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
I remember.

90
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
You gave them to Richard.

91
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Oh, yeah.

92
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
I remember now.

93
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
You handed them to me.

94
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
What did I do with them?

95
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
I hope they aren't lost.

96
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Oh, don't worry, Harry.

97
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
They have to be here.

98
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
I remember.

99
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
I gave them to Robbie to hold

100
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
so I wouldn't lose them.

101
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Where's Robbie?

102
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Relax, Harry.

103
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Robbie went to pick up

104
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
the clip-on bow ties.

105
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Oh, I forgot.

106
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
What time is it?

107
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
It's still a little over two hours, Harry.

108
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Just relax.

109
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
What about the rings?

110
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
I'm sure Robbie has them.

111
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,600
No, no, Robbie doesn't have them.

112
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
He gave them to me to hold on to them

113
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
because he didn't want the responsibility of holding them.

114
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
I put them in my tuxedo,

115
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,600
but in the lapel pocket.

116
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,600
That's a relief.

117
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,600
I was really worried.

118
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
I'll hold on to them for you.

119
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
The best man always keeps the rings.

120
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
You're right.

121
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
You hold on to them so there won't be a problem later.

122
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Well,

123
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
now, I think we'd better get dressed, fellas.

124
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
All right!

125
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Robbie will bring the ties back.

126
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Hey, leaving me?

127
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
You'll be fine.

128
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Try to take it easy.

129
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,600
It'll all be over in two hours.

130
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Over?

131
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,600
The wedding ceremony will be over.

132
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
You'll be husband and wife.

133
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
I guess you're right.

134
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Two hours from now.

1
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
And now for... something old,

2
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
something new, something borrowed,

3
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
and something blue.

4
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
OK. Let's see.

5
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Something borrowed.

6
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
That's this dress. Borrowed from Marilyn.

7
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Something blue.

8
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
My wristband.

9
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,600
I wore it when I married your father.

10
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Oh, Mother. I forgot you still had it.

11
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,600
It's just so lovely.

12
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
I bought it in an antique shop

13
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
when I was about eighteen years old.

14
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,600
I saved it for my wedding day.

15
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,600
And you saved it for me, didn't you, Mother?

16
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Yes, honey. I did.

17
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Are we ever going to finish?

18
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:53,600
All right. OK.

19
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Something borrowed.

20
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
The wedding dress. And something blue.

21
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
The wristband. Something old?

22
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Something old.

23
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Right. What's old?

24
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Of course!

25
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Something old.

26
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
I had planned to wear them.

27
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:20,600
Grandma's pearls!

28
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Oh, Grandpa will be so pleased that you're wearing them.

29
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
I'm sure he misses Grandma on a day like this.

30
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Help me with them, Marilyn.

31
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
I've never worn them before.

32
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I've been saving them for today.

33
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Saving them for today?

34
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Oh, you're a real Stewart!

35
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Oh, there you go.

36
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Lovely!

37
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Lovely!

38
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Lovely!

39
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Something borrowed, something blue.

40
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Something old...

41
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,600
and now for something new.

42
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
The veil.

43
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Oh, it's so beautiful, Marilyn!

44
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,600
You really are a fabulous designer, Marilyn.

45
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Doesn't it look just right on Susan? Susan

46
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Perfect!

47
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
And when you both say "I do",

48
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Harry will lift this veil over your head

49
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,600
and kiss the bride.

50
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Oh, I'm so excited!

51
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
When you said "I do", Marilyn,

52
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,600
it suddenly became real.

53
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
That's all right, Susan.

54
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
You've got the wedding-day jitters!

55
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,600
In less than two hours,

56
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,600
you will be Mrs. Harry Bennett.

57
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Oh, that reminds me.

58
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
If we don't get dressed,

59
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
we won't be there

60
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,600
to see Susan become Mrs. Harry Bennett.

61
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Before you leave, do I look all right?

62
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,600
You never looked better.

63
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Mom.

64
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,600
She's right.

65
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,600
And that's dear little Max.

66
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Got to go and feed him.

67
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,600
What am I supposed to do?

68
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
Take off the veil,

69
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
kick off your shoes, and sit down.

70
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
We'll come upstairs and get you in a little while.

71
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Richard's going to take some wedding pictures

72
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
before the ceremony.

73
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
So just relax.

74
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Are you kidding? Relax?

75
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Susan Stewart...

76
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,600
you are about to become Susan Bennett

77
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Mrs. Harry Bennett.

1
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Philip... Ellen.

2
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Ah, Judge.

3
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
How are you?

4
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
I think it's time for the wedding to begin.

5
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,600
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

6
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Please take your places.

7
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
The wedding ceremony is about to begin.

8
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
OK, Jane. Start the music.

9
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Dearly beloved,

10
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,600
we are gathered here today

11
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,600
to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.

12
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Do either of you have any reason

13
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,600
why you should not be legally joined in marriage?

14
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Is there anyone present who can show

15
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
any just cause why these two people

16
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,600
should not be legally joined in marriage?

17
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Then, Harry Bennett, do you take Susan Stewart

18
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,600
to be your lawful, wedded wife?

19
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
I do.

20
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,600
And you, Susan Stewart,

21
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
do you take Harry Bennett

22
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
to be your lawful, wedded husband?

23
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,600
I do.

24
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
The rings, please.

25
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,600
I have them, Harry.

26
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:40,600
By the power vested in me by the laws of the State of New York,

27
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,600
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

28
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,600
You may kiss the bride now, Harry.
