Episode 07 - Man's Best Friend

1
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Robbie, this new Walkman is absolutely wonderful. Robbie

2
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Richard and Marilyn bought it for me for my birthday.

3
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,600
They're so thoughtful.

4
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,600
You are very lucky, Robbie, to have such a nice family. Robbie

5
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Is something wrong, Alexandra? Alexandra

6
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
No, nothing.

7
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Yes, there is.

8
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
I can tell.

9
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
What's the matter?

10
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Come on, you can tell me.

11
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
What's up?

12
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
I don't know.

13
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Something's wrong.

14
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,600
OK, let's talk.

15
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,600
I received a letter from my parents this morning.

16
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Did they write some bad news?

17
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
No.

18
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Well, then why are you so sad?

19
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I miss them.

20
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
I miss them very much.

21
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
I'm sorry, Alexandra.

22
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
But I understand.

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,600
The Molinas treat me so nicely, Molina

24
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,600
and I love being with your family so much ...

25
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,600
but when I received the letter

26
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
with photographs of my family, I cried.

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,600
I cried because I miss them all.

28
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
You really miss your family, don't you?

29
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Yes. I know I must seem silly.

30
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
It's not like I have nobody.

31
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I like the Molinas very much,

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
and they're so kind to me.

33
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Hey, why don't we go out

34
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
for a cheeseburger and french fries?

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
That'll cheer you up.

36
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
And you can use my Walkman.

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
That's a good idea.

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
But if we go out,

39
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,600
please don't complain

40
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
about your math teacher or your math homework.

41
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
I want to have fun.

42
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
So do I.

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
I have to turn off the lights,

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
or else my father will get really angry.

45
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
He says I never turn them out when I leave.

46
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
If they come home and they're on ...

47
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Do you hear something?

48
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Yes.

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
What was that?

50
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
It sounded like a dog barking.

51
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,600
It sounded like a dog barking right here.

52
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Yeah.

53
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,600
A dog!

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
A springer spaniel!

55
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Come on in!

56
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Make yourself at home.

57
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Oh, you poor little thing.

58
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Come here.

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Come on.

60
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Poor baby.

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Where did you come from?

62
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Her name's Gemma,

63
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
and she belongs to Mr. and Mrs. Levinson.

64
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
There's a phone number --

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,600
five five five ... eight four four eight. 555

66
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Robbie, maybe you should call them Robbie

67
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
and tell the Levinsons we have their cute little spaniel.

68
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
I've always wanted a springer spaniel.

69
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
She's so cute.

70
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:20,600
The number you are calling -- 555-8448 --

71
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
is no longer in service.

72
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,600
The number's no longer in service.

73
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Oh, you poor, poor baby.

74
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
You've lost your family.

75
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
We'll find them.

76
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Don't worry, Alexandra.

1
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,100
Don't worry, Alexandra.

2
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
We'll find the owner.

3
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
How, Robbie?

4
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,100
Let me think.

5
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Gemma, sit. Gemma

6
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Good Gemma.

7
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Give me your paw.

8
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Good Gemma.

9
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
This dog is well trained.

10
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,100
She likes you, too.

11
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
So how are we going to find the owners?

12
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
With a little help from the ASPCA,

13
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,100
the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

14
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
They're the ones.

15
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
We once found a cat.

16
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
She was caught in the branches of our tree.

17
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,100
And Dad called the ASPCA.

18
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,100
They came and solved the problem.

19
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,100
Robbie, let's call them. Robbie

20
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:46,100
Let me see -- ASPCA....

21
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:52,100
Here it is.

22
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,100
ASPCA Animal Shelter. ASPCA

23
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:59,100
555-7700.

24
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:12,100
(beep...)

25
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Hello, ASPCA.

26
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,100
Hello, my name is Robbie Stewart.

27
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,100
I have a lost dog I'd like to bring to you.

28
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
How late are you open?

29
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,100
We're open till nine P.M.

30
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Thank you.

31
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
I'll bring the dog over by nine.

32
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Thanks.

33
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,100
Bye.

34
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
Thanks.

35
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,100
Good-bye.

36
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,100
They're still open?

37
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
They're open until nine o'clock.

38
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
We have two and a half hours.

39
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Let's take Gemma by there now.

40
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
They'll find the owner.

41
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
I hope so.

42
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,100
I'm so sad to see this little dog without her family.

43
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100
I'm sure they'll find the owner.

44
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,100
But if they don't, I'll adopt her.

45
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,100
She's so cute.

46
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,100
Look at those eyes.

47
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,100
She's hard to resist.

48
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Don't you just love her?

49
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,100
I'd like to keep her, too.

50
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
But I'll be going home to Greece

51
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,100
at the end of the semester.

52
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,100
She just wants love and affection.

53
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,100
Come on, Robbie.

54
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Let's get her to the animal shelter,

55
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,100
so they can find her owners quickly.

56
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,100
Don't worry, Gemma.

57
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
We'll get you home.

58
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
It's not easy being away from home.

59
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,100
Come on, poochie.

60
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,100
Atta girl!

61
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,100
Let's go.

62
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,100
We're off to the animal shelter.

63
00:11:38,100 --> 00:12:01,100
let's thank taotao

64
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Your name?

65
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Robbie Stewart. Robbie Stewart

66
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,100
And this is Alexandra Pappas.

67
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,100
Your name will do, Mr. Stewart.

68
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Your address?

69
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,100
46 Linden street, Riverdale. Riverdale

70
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Where did you find the dog?

71
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,100
She found us.

72
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,100
You tried calling the number on the collar?

73
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,100
Yes, but the number's no longer in service.

74
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,100
And there's no address on the dog tag?

75
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
There's no other information.

76
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
No ID number.

77
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,100
Without that, it's hard.

78
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,100
You will try to find the dog's owner.

79
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,100
Oh, we'll try, believe me.

80
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,100
And if you don't?

81
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Yes?

82
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,100
If you don't ... can I ... can I adopt the dog?

83
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,100
Why, yes.

84
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,100
If the owners don't claim the dog in forty-eight hours,

85
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,100
then you can apply for adoption.

86
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
How do I do that?

87
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
You really want to?

88
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,100
Yes, I'm serious.

89
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,100
If no one comes to claim Gemma,

90
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
I'd like to adopt her.

91
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,100
It's not difficult.

1
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,100
OK.

2
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,100
If you want to adopt an animal,

3
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,100
first we need to know some references.

4
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,100
References?

5
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
People we know?

6
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Friends, teachers....

7
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
We need to talk to some people about you.

8
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,100
We want to be sure that you're responsible

9
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
and that you can take good care of an animal.

10
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,100
Then you have to fill out this form

11
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,100
about your family background.

12
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,100
Is that it?

13
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
No, there's more.

14
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,100
We need to know about your history with animals.

15
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
Have you ever owned an animal?

16
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Yes.

17
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,100
We had a cat when I was eight years old.

18
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,100
I love cats.

19
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
Do you have any animals now?

20
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
Unfortunately, no.

21
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
Anything else?

22
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
We also like to know

23
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
your reasons for wanting an animal.

24
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,100
Just to hold it and cuddle with it.

25
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
Just to have as a pet.

26
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,100
I love animals.

27
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:06,100
To have a friend -- a pal.

28
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,100
You know, man's best friend is his dog.

29
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,100
And one thing more.

30
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
If you're under twenty-one years of age ...

31
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,100
That's me.

32
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
Then an adult must sign for you.

33
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Uh-oh.

34
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,100
No problem.

35
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
My parents will think it's a good idea.

36
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
I'll be back with them.

37
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
If the real owners don't come to claim Gemma ...

38
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
After forty-eight hours.

39
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
But please call first.

40
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Thanks for your information and for being so helpful.

41
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,100
It's my pleasure.

42
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Nice talking to both of you.

43
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Thanks again.

44
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Bye.

45
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,100
Maybe the real owners will come to claim her.

46
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
Her eyes look so sad.

47
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100
She must really miss them.

48
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
I see you're both animal lovers.

49
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,100
We are.

50
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,100
Good-bye, Miss Aborn.

51
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
We'll call in a couple of days.

52
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
Good-bye, and thanks for bringing Gemma in.

53
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Bye.

54
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:09,100
I keep thinking about the dog -- about Gemma,

55
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,100
alone in the animal shelter.

56
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
I know.

57
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
But I promise you, Alexandra,

58
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,100
the dog is just fine.

59
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,100
They're very kind to the animals.

60
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,100
I know they are.

61
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,100
I mean about her being alone.

62
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,100
Even if they are kind to Gemma,

63
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
she's still alone, without her family.

64
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,100
Ready, folks?

65
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,100
Are you ready, Alexandra?

66
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Yes, I'm ready.

67
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,100
I'll have the chef's salad, please.

68
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,100
I will have a cheeseburger, medium rare,

69
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,100
with raw onion, and french fries, please.

70
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Anything to drink?

71
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,100
A diet cola, please.

72
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Ginger ale with lots of ice for me, thank you.

73
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
I've got it.

74
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Thanks.

75
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Aren't you surprised

76
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,100
that the animal shelter is so careful

77
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,100
about finding homes for the animals?

78
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,100
No, I'm not.

79
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,100
And a cheeseburger, medium rare,

80
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,100
with onion and french fries.

81
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
And a ginger ale with lots of ice.

82
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Salad dressing?

83
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Hey, I wanted you to hear my new sound system

84
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
when the dog scratched on the front door.

85
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,100
and then we'll go back to my house.

86
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
I want you to hear my new tapes.

87
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
I've got some great new dance music.

88
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Hello.

89
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,100
Stewart residence. Stewart

90
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Hello.

91
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
Is Robbie Stewart there? Robbie Stewart

92
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,100
This is he.

93
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
Who's this?

94
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,100
This is Linda Aborn from the animal shelter.

95
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,100
It's Linda from the animal shelter.

96
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,100
Yes, Linda.

97
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Hi.

98
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,100
We have good news and bad news, Robbie.

99
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,100
Oh?

100
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
The good news is that the Levinsons have come by

101
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,100
to pick up the dog.

102
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,100
The bad news is, you won't be able to adopt the dog.

103
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,100
That's OK.

104
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,100
Come by one day and look at some of the other dogs.

105
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,100
I'm sure there's one for you.

106
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Thanks, Robbie.

107
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,100
And the Levinsons thank you for bringing their dog to us. Levinson

108
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,100
Thanks, Linda.

109
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,100
Bye.

110
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:25,100
The owners claimed Gemma?

111
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,100
That's right.

112
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
I'm glad for the dog.

113
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,100
I guess I am, too.

114
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,100
She said if I come by,

115
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,100
she'll help me find another dog.

116
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,100
Come on.

117
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Let's dance.
