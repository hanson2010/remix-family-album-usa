Episode 07 - Man's Best Friend

1
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Robbie, this new Walkman is absolutely wonderful.

2
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Richard and Marilyn bought it for me for my birthday.

3
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,600
They're so thoughtful.

4
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,600
You are very lucky, Robbie, to have such a nice family.

5
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Is something wrong, Alexandra?

6
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
No, nothing.

7
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Yes, there is.

8
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
I can tell.

9
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
What's the matter?

10
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Come on, you can tell me.

11
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
What's up?

12
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
I don't know.

13
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Something's wrong.

14
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,600
OK, let's talk.

15
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,600
I received a letter from my parents this morning.

16
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Did they write some bad news?

17
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
No.

18
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Well, then why are you so sad?

19
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I miss them.

20
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
I miss them very much.

21
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
I'm sorry, Alexandra.

22
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
But I understand.

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,600
The Molinas treat me so nicely, Molina

24
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,600
and I love being with your family so much...

25
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,600
but when I received the letter

26
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
with photographs of my family, I cried.

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,600
I cried because I miss them all.

28
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
You really miss your family, don't you?

29
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Yes. I know I must seem silly.

30
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
It's not like I have nobody.

31
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I like the Molinas very much,

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
and they're so kind to me.

33
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Hey, why don't we go out

34
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
for a cheeseburger and french fries?

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
That'll cheer you up.

36
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
And you can use my Walkman.

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
That's a good idea.

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
But if we go out,

39
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,600
please don't complain

40
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
about your math teacher or your math homework.

41
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
I want to have fun.

42
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
So do I.

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
I have to turn off the lights,

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
or else my father will get really angry.

45
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
He says I never turn them out when I leave.

46
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
If they come home and they're on...

47
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Do you hear something?

48
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Yes.

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
What was that?

50
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
It sounded like a dog barking.

51
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,600
It sounded like a dog barking right here.

52
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Yeah.

53
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,600
A dog!

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
A springer spaniel!

55
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Come on in!

56
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Make yourself at home.

57
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Oh, you poor little thing.

58
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Come here.

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Come on.

60
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Poor baby.

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Where did you come from?

62
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Her name's Gemma,

63
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
and she belongs to Mr. and Mrs. Levinson.

64
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
There's a phone number

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,600
555-8448.

66
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Robbie, maybe you should call them Robbie

67
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
and tell the Levinsons we have their cute little spaniel.

68
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
I've always wanted a springer spaniel.

69
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
She's so cute.

70
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:20,600
The number you are calling "555-8448"

71
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
is no longer in service.

72
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,600
The number's no longer in service.

73
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Oh, you poor, poor baby.

74
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
You've lost your family.

75
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
We'll find them.

76
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Don't worry, Alexandra.

1
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Don't worry, Alexandra.

2
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
We'll find the owner.

3
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
How, Robbie?

4
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Let me think.

5
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Gemma, sit.

6
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Good Gemma.

7
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Give me your paw.

8
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Good Gemma.

9
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
This dog is well trained.

10
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
She likes you, too.

11
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
So how are we going to find the owners?

12
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
With a little help from the ASPCA,

13
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,600
the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

14
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
They're the ones.

15
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
We once found a cat.

16
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
She was caught in the branches of our tree.

17
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
And Dad called the ASPCA.

18
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
They came and solved the problem.

19
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Robbie, let's call them.

20
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Let me see. ASPCA...

21
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,600
Here it is.

22
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
ASPCA Animal Shelter.

23
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,600
555-7700.

24
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:35,600
(beep...)

25
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Hello, ASPCA.

26
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Hello, my name is Robbie Stewart.

27
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
I have a lost dog I'd like to bring to you.

28
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
How late are you open?

29
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
We're open till nine P.M.

30
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Thank you.

31
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I'll bring the dog over by nine.

32
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Thanks.

33
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,600
Bye.

34
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Thanks.

35
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Good-bye.

36
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
They're still open?

37
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
They're open until nine o'clock.

38
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
We have two and a half hours.

39
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Let's take Gemma by there now.

40
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
They'll find the owner.

41
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
I hope so.

42
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I'm so sad to see this little dog without her family.

43
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
I'm sure they'll find the owner.

44
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,600
But if they don't, I'll adopt her.

45
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
She's so cute.

46
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Look at those eyes.

47
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
She's hard to resist.

48
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Don't you just love her?

49
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,600
I'd like to keep her, too.

50
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
But I'll be going home to Greece

51
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
at the end of the semester.

52
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,600
She just wants love and affection.

53
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Come on, Robbie.

54
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Let's get her to the animal shelter,

55
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
so they can find her owners quickly.

56
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Don't worry, Gemma.

57
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
We'll get you home.

58
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
It's not easy being away from home.

59
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Come on, poochie.

60
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Atta girl!

61
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Let's go.

62
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,600
We're off to the animal shelter.

63
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:24,600
let's thank taotao

64
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Your name?

65
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Robbie Stewart.

66
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
And this is Alexandra Pappas.

67
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Your name will do, Mr. Stewart.

68
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Your address?

69
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,600
46 Linden street, Riverdale.

70
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Where did you find the dog?

71
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
She found us.

72
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
You tried calling the number on the collar?

73
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Yes, but the number's no longer in service.

74
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
And there's no address on the dog tag?

75
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
There's no other information.

76
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
No ID number.

77
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Without that, it's hard.

78
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,600
You will try to find the dog's owner.

79
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Oh, we'll try, believe me.

80
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,600
And if you don't?

81
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Yes?

82
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,600
If you don't... can I... can I adopt the dog?

83
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Why, yes.

84
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,600
If the owners don't claim the dog in 48 hours,

85
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
then you can apply for adoption.

86
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
How do I do that?

87
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
You really want to?

88
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Yes, I'm serious.

89
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
If no one comes to claim Gemma,

90
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
I'd like to adopt her.

91
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
It's not difficult.

1
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,600
OK.

2
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
If you want to adopt an animal,

3
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
first we need to know some references.

4
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
References?

5
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
People we know?

6
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Friends, teachers...

7
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
We need to talk to some people about you.

8
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,600
We want to be sure that you're responsible

9
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
and that you can take good care of an animal.

10
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Then you have to fill out this form

11
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
about your family background.

12
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Is that it?

13
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
No, there's more.

14
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,600
We need to know about your history with animals.

15
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Have you ever owned an animal?

16
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Yes.

17
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,600
We had a cat when I was eight years old.

18
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
I love cats.

19
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Do you have any animals now?

20
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Unfortunately, no.

21
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Anything else?

22
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
We also like to know

23
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
your reasons for wanting an animal.

24
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Just to hold it and cuddle with it.

25
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Just to have as a pet.

26
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
I love animals.

27
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,600
To have a friend - a pal.

28
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,600
You know, man's best friend is his dog.

29
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,600
And one thing more.

30
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
If you're under 21 years of age...

31
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
That's me.

32
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Then an adult must sign for you.

33
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Uh-oh.

34
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
No problem.

35
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
My parents will think it's a good idea.

36
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
I'll be back with them.

37
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
If the real owners don't come to claim Gemma...

38
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
After forty-eight hours.

39
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
But please call first.

40
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Thanks for your information and for being so helpful.

41
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
It's my pleasure.

42
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,600
Nice talking to both of you.

43
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Thanks again.

44
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Bye.

45
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Maybe the real owners will come to claim her.

46
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,600
Her eyes look so sad.

47
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
She must really miss them.

48
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
I see you're both animal lovers.

49
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
We are.

50
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Good-bye, Miss Aborn.

51
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
We'll call in a couple of days.

52
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Good-bye, and thanks for bringing Gemma in.

53
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Bye.

54
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:55,600
I keep thinking about the dog, about Gemma,

55
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
alone in the animal shelter.

56
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
I know.

57
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
But I promise you, Alexandra,

58
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
the dog is just fine.

59
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
They're very kind to the animals.

60
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
I know they are.

61
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
I mean about her being alone.

62
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Even if they are kind to Gemma,

63
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
she's still alone, without her family.

64
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Ready, folks?

65
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Are you ready, Alexandra?

66
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Yes, I'm ready.

67
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
I'll have the chef's salad, please.

68
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,600
I will have a cheeseburger, medium rare,

69
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,600
with raw onion, and french fries, please.

70
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Anything to drink?

71
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
A diet cola, please.

72
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,600
Ginger ale with lots of ice for me, thank you.

73
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
I've got it.

74
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Thanks.

75
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Aren't you surprised

76
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
that the animal shelter is so careful

77
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
about finding homes for the animals?

78
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
No, I'm not.

79
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
And a cheeseburger, medium rare,

80
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
with onion and french fries.

81
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
And a ginger ale with lots of ice.

82
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Salad dressing?

83
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Hey, I wanted you to hear my new sound system

84
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
when the dog scratched on the front door.

85
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Let's finish eating,

86
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
and then we'll go back to my house.

87
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
I want you to hear my new tapes.

88
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
I've got some great new dance music.

89
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:23,600
(music... beep...)

90
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Hello.

91
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
Stewart residence.

92
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Hello.

93
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Is Robbie Stewart there?

94
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
This is he.

95
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Who's this?

96
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
This is Linda Aborn from the animal shelter.

97
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
It's Linda from the animal shelter.

98
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Yes, Linda.

99
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Hi.

100
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
We have good news and bad news, Robbie.

101
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Oh?

102
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
The good news is that the Levinsons have come by

103
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
to pick up the dog.

104
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,600
The bad news is, you won't be able to adopt the dog.

105
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
That's OK.

106
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Come by one day and look at some of the other dogs.

107
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
I'm sure there's one for you.

108
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Thanks, Robbie.

109
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,600
And the Levinsons thank you for bringing their dog to us.

110
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Thanks, Linda.

111
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Bye.

112
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:11,600
The owners claimed Gemma?

113
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
That's right.

114
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
I'm glad for the dog.

115
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
I guess I am, too.

116
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,600
She said if I come by,

117
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
she'll help me find another dog.

118
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Come on.

119
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
Let's dance.
