Episode 10 - Smell the Flowers

1
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Good morning, Susan.

2
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Good morning, Sam.

3
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,600
What's the schedule today?

4
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Ten o'clock,

5
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
telephone FAO Schwarz about the new twin baby dolls.

6
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
OK.

7
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Telephone Mrs. Zaskey at the advertising agency.

8
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
I did that. Go on.

9
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Eleven o'clock, approve the sketches for the toy spaceship.

10
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Where are they?

11
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Right here.

12
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Did you look at them?

13
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Yes, I did.

14
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
What do you think of the spaceship?

15
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
I think the kids'll love it.

16
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Would you show me the drawings, please?

17
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Huh.

18
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Now, what else is on the schedule today?

19
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Well, at one o'clock

20
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
you have a lunch appointment with Mr. Levine,

21
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
the client from the Toytown Stores.

22
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Where?

23
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
At Rossano's.

24
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Hmm. Anything else?

25
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
At four o'clock,

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
you have a meeting with the production staff

27
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
in the conference room.

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Make sure everybody is at that meeting.

29
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Will do.

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,600
At six you're meeting, Mr. Ozawa.

31
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Oh, yes. Are his models here?

32
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
They're in my office.

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
I'd like to see them.

34
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Right.

35
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
What else?

36
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Come on, Sam.

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
You work too hard, Susan.

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,600
When was your last day off?

39
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Hmm. I can't remember.

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
You really ought to take some time off.

41
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
What for?

42
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,600
To enjoy the simple things in life...

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
I know, Sam.

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Maybe soon.

45
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
To smell the flowers.

46
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Oh, wait a minute. What's today's date?

47
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Today is the twelfth. Why?

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,600
It seems to me I scheduled something else.

49
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,600
There's nothing else in the appointment book.

50
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
I'm sure I did.

51
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Oh, well, I'll probably remember it later.

52
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,600
I hope it isn't important.

53
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Hmm. It's probably nothing.

54
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
OK, let's get started.

55
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Would you call Priscilla Smith at FAO Schwarz, please?

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Right.

57
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:29,600
These are the models from the Japanese film maker.

58
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Thank you. Just put them on my desk.

59
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,600
And the new drawings for the toy spaceship.

60
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Wonderful.

61
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:50,600
That was fast.

62
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
We have a new artist.

63
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
She's very talented.

64
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
What time is it, anyway?

65
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
My watch stopped.

66
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
It's eleven thirty.

67
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,600
What time is my lunch date with Bill Levine?

68
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
One o'clock.

69
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Remind me to leave at twelve forty-five.

70
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Did you remember your other appointment for today?

71
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
No,

72
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
but I have a feeling

73
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
it's going to be too late when I do remember.

74
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Yes, Sam?

75
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
I just solved the mystery.

76
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
What did I forget?

77
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,600
You have some guests in the reception room.

78
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
What? Who?

79
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Mr. Harry Bennett and his daughter.

80
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
I remember!

81
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Oh... Harry!

82
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,600
I made a lunch date with him and his daughter weeks ago.

83
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Is he a client?

84
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,600
He's a friend.

85
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Well, he's here with his daughter to have lunch.

86
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
I met her at Thanksgiving,

87
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,600
and I promised to have lunch with both of them today.

88
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Yes, indeed.

89
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600
What are you going to do about your appointment

90
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
with Mr. Levine?

91
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Any suggestions?

92
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Oh!

1
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Hi, Michelle.

2
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Hello, Harry.

3
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
It's nice to see you again.

4
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Hello.

5
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Hi, Susan.

6
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,600
We have both been excited about seeing you

7
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
and having lunch with you today.

8
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Michelle picked these flowers out for you.

9
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Daddy, can we go soon?

10
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
We're going to go to lunch in a few minutes, honey.

11
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
But I'm thirsty.

12
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,600
OK. You go out and get a drink of water at the fountain.

13
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
The fountain is over there, Michelle.

14
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Near the Exit sign.

15
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Thank you.

16
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Michelle is a little shy.

17
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,600
I used to be that way when I was her age.

18
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Harry, if Michelle doesn't want to go,

19
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
we don't have to.

20
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
She'll be fine.

21
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Remember,

22
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,600
I haven't dated any one else since her mother died.

23
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,600
This is a little difficult for her.

24
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Are you ready to go?

25
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Yes. But could you wait one minute?

26
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
I have a call to make.

27
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Would you excuse me?

28
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Sam, get Mr. Levine at Toytown Stores

29
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
on the telephone for me, please.

30
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Right.

31
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Hello. Susan Stewart calling Mr. Levine, please.

32
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
He's on the phone.

33
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Mr. Levine, Susan Stewart.

34
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,600
I find myself in an embarrassing situation.

35
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,600
I made another lunch date for today

36
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,600
and forgot to enter it in my appointment book.

37
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Can you and I meet for drinks tomorrow?

38
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I'd really appreciate it... Yes... Thank you...

39
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Tomorrow at five o'clock at the Biltmore.

40
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
I'll see you then.

41
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Thank you, Mr. Levine.

42
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Welcome to the South Street restaurant, folks.

43
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
What'll it be?

44
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
What do you recommend?

45
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Well, the crab salad's always a big hit.

46
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Susan, would you like the crab salad?

47
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
I'd love the crab salad.

48
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Michelle, would you like to try the crab salad, too?

49
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
OK, Daddy.

50
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
We'll have three crab salads

51
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
and a pitcher of lemonade.

52
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Help yourself to celery and carrots and other vegetables.

53
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
We used to catch crabs.

54
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Where was that?

55
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
We had a summer house on Fire Island.

56
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Do you remember, Michelle?

57
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Sure.

58
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
You and Mommy used to take me on the ferryboat.

59
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Sometimes, at night,

60
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
we would go down to the beach and catch crabs,

61
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
remember?

62
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
With a piece of meat on a string!

63
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Right.

64
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Well, I think I'm going to go get us all some vegetables.

65
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,600
There you go.

66
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Thank you.

67
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:59,600
And some ice-cold lemonade.

68
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Thank you.

69
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Enjoy it.

70
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Michelle, can I help you with the lemonade?

71
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
No, thank you.

72
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
I'll wait for my father.

73
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Michelle, can we have a talk?

74
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
Sure.

75
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
I know you miss your mother.

76
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
You do?

77
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Yes. And I'm not trying to take her place.

78
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Then why are you and Daddy

79
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
spending so much time together?

80
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Because we like each other.

81
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,600
And right now, he needs a friend.

82
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
I'm his friend.

83
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,600
I know you are.

84
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Sometimes he's very sad.

85
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,600
And so are you, I think.

86
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Sometimes.

87
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,600
I'd like to be your friend, too.

88
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Will you let me be your friend, Michelle?

89
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:03,600
So, what were you two talking about?

90
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Just girl talk, Daddy.

91
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
It's too hard to explain.

92
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
You're probably right.

93
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Well, let's get started.

1
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh, it's a quarter to four,

2
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,600
and I have a production meeting at four.

3
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,600
I planned to take you for a ride in Central Park

4
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
in a horse and carriage.

5
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Harry, I'd love to,

6
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
but I have work to do.

7
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,600
OK. We'll walk back to your office with you.

8
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
It's so nice out.

9
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,600
I decided to forget about my accounting problems

10
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,600
and just enjoy this beautiful spring day.

11
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Take the time, Susan.

12
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
I know I should,

13
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,600
but ... well, there are too many things to do.

14
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
I understand.

15
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
I'll go for a ride with Michelle.

16
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Right.

17
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Well, I had a really nice time.

18
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
So did I.

19
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
So did I.

20
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
I'm sorry you can't come with us, Susan.

21
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
So am I.

22
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Bye-bye.

23
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Harry! Michelle!

24
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Can you wait till I make a phone call?

25
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Sure.

26
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Susan Stewart's office.

27
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Sam, this is Susan. Sam

28
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Hi. How was lunch?

29
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Fine.

30
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
You're late.

31
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,600
The production department's waiting in the conference room.

32
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
I know.

33
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Ask Paul Smith to fill in for me.

34
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
He knows everything about the production schedule,

35
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
and he can answer any questions.

36
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Right.

37
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Don't tell any one,

38
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
but I'm taking a little time to smell the flowers.

39
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Good for you.

40
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
It'll be our secret.

41
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
But schedule another production meeting for tomorrow.

42
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
I'll be back

43
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
for my six o'clock appointment with Mr. Ozawa.

44
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
OK, Susan.

45
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
And have a nice afternoon.

46
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Thanks.

47
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
She likes you.

48
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
I know. I like her.

49
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
How'd you do it?

50
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
We had a talk.

51
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
About what?

52
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Life.

53
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
And what did you decide?

54
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,600
That's a secret... between us women.
