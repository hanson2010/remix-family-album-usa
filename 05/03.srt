Episode 03 - Grandpa's Trunk

1
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Marilyn, you want coffee or tea? Marilyn

2
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Coffee, please.

3
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:15,600
I am so excited!

4
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
At this time tomorrow morning,

5
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Grandpa will be sitting in the kitchen with us.

6
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
When does he arrive?

7
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
At six o'clock this evening.

8
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
By plane?

9
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
No, by train.

10
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Are we picking him up at the station?

11
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Not Grandpa.

12
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
He doesn't want anybody picking him up.

13
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
He likes to be independent.

14
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Oh, let's go upstairs and prepare Grandpa's room.

15
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Great! Let's do it!

16
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Good morning, Mom.

17
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Morning.

18
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Well, hi, fellas.

19
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,000
Hello.

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,600
Hi, honey.

21
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Morning, Marilyn.

22
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
We are going upstairs to set up Grandpa's room.

23
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
There's coffee ready.

24
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I'm really excited about seeing Grandpa.

25
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Me, too. Milk, please.

26
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
He's so funny.

27
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
He always makes me laugh.

28
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,600
I hope Grandpa's going to like living with us.

29
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
I think he will.

30
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
It just takes time to feel comfortable in a new place.

31
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Won't he miss being in Florida?

32
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Well, he will.

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
But I think he'll like being here with the family.

34
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Are you sure about that?

35
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
It's crazy here most of the time.

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
But it's fun.

37
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
That's for sure.

38
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
You know,

39
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
maybe I'll put together some photos of Grandpa

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
as a "welcome" present.

41
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
That's a neat idea.

42
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
What can I do?

43
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
I've got it!

44
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I have a picture of Grandpa and Dad and me in my wallet.

45
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
It's from the Fathers and Sons' Breakfast

46
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
at my junior high school graduation.

47
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Oh, I remember this picture.

48
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,600
I'd really like to pick up Grandpa at the railroad station.

49
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Railroad stations or airports--

50
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Grandpa always tells us he'll get here by himself.

51
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
He's something!

52
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Is this all Grandpa's stuff?

53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
That's it.

54
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,600
But I'm sure he has a few bags with him on the train.

55
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,600
What's inside?

56
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,600
I don't know. It's locked.

57
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Hi.

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Oh, hi, darling.

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Morning, Philip.

60
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
I want to put some of my good hangers in Grandpa's closet.

61
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
You know I'm very excited about his arrival.

62
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
We are, too.

63
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Susan called early this morning. Susan

64
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
She's unhappy

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
because she's had to go to Chicago on a business trip

66
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
and can't leave till tonight.

67
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
She wants to be here for Grandpa.

68
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Well, Grandpa will be disappointed, too.

69
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
He loves Susan.

70
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
She always reminds him of Grandma. Susan

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Well, how's everything here?

72
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Fine. We were just wondering about this trunk.

73
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,600
It's locked.

74
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Oh. I have the key. Grandpa sent it to me.

1
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,100
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

2
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,100
No, it's not taken.

3
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Oh, thank you.

4
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Oh, let me help you with this.

5
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,100
Oh, thank you.

6
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Do you want to sit by the window?

7
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,100
No, no, no. I like the aisle seat better.

8
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Please, you sit by the window.

9
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:32,100
My name is Stewart... Malcolm Stewart.

10
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,100
Pleased to meet you.

11
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,100
I'm Elsa Tobin. How do you do?

12
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Do you live in New York?

13
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,100
No, no. I'm from Florida.

14
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,100
I am, too. But didn't you just get on?

15
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,100
No, no. I just changed my seat.

16
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,100
A man next to me was smoking,

17
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,100
and smoke really bothers me.

18
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,100
Where are you from in Florida?

19
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Titusville. It's near Orlando. Titusville

20
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,100
Small world. I'm from Titusville, too.

21
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,100
Really? What part?

22
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
My husband and I live near Spaceport.

23
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,100
I know that area.

24
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,100
My house is only a few miles from Spaceport.

25
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Do you still live there?

26
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
Oh yes, yes. My husband's there now.

27
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,100
He couldn't take time off to come to New York with me.

28
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Do you still live there?

29
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,100
No. I sold the house and the furniture,

30
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,100
put a few personal things in an old trunk,

31
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,100
and shipped it to my children in New York.

32
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
That's my destination.

33
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,100
Are you married?

34
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,100
My wife died four years ago.

35
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,100
She was a wonderful woman. A real friend.

36
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,100
I'm sorry. Really, I'm sorry.

37
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Lots of wonderful memories.

38
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,100
We were married almost fifty years.

39
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,100
Well, forty-seven, to be exact.

40
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,100
John and I celebrate our fortieth anniversary next month.

41
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Oh, congratulations! That's nice.

42
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,100
What does John do? John

43
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,100
He's an aerospace engineer

44
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,100
and works for Orlando Aircraft Corporation.

45
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:33,100
He started with them almost forty years ago.

46
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,100
What do you do?

47
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,100
I just retired. Had my own company.

48
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:46,100
A construction company. Roads, bridges, big stuff.

49
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,100
But I just sold it and retired.

50
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:57,100
Excuse me, ma'am. Ticket, please.

51
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Would you kindly hold these keys, please?

52
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,100
I have a ticket, I know.

53
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
I was in the smoking section.

54
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
It's OK, lady. Take your time.

55
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,100
I'm sure it's in your purse, Mrs. Tobin.

56
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,100
Oh, here it is.

57
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,100
And here are your keys.

58
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
Thank you.

59
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Do you have family in New York?

60
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,100
No, no. But I do have very close friends in New York City.

61
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,100
We like to go to the theater together.

62
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,100
You said you have family in New York.

63
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
Yes, indeed.

64
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,100
A son and his wife and their three children--

65
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,100
my grandchildren.

66
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,100
You must be excited.

67
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,100
I can't wait, to see them!

68
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,100
Are you going to live with them?

69
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,100
Yes.

70
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
Permanently?

71
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,100
Well... they want me to,

72
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,100
but it's too early to know for sure.

73
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,100
I'm pretty independent.

74
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,100
I tried to teach my kids the importance of independence,

75
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,100
but I'm not sure I want to be alone.

76
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Some people don't mind being alone. I do.

77
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,100
I understand. But tell me.

78
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
Why did you stop working?

79
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:39,100
I retired because... I wanted to be with my family.

80
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,100
I didn't want to be alone anymore!

1
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,100
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Amtrak is happy to announce our arrival in New York City.

3
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,100
The train will be stopping in five minutes.

4
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,100
Please check to be sure you have your belongings.

5
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,100
And have a good stay in the Big Apple.

6
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
Thank you.

7
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
Well, here we are.

8
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,100
It was so nice meeting you, Mr. Stewart.

9
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,100
And nice meeting you, too, Mrs. Tobin.

10
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,100
Please look us up.

11
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
We're in the phone book.

12
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Dr. Philip Stewart, in Riverdale. Philip Stewarrt

13
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Your son?

14
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,100
That's right. And have a good time in New York.

15
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,100
And don't be so independent.

16
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,100
You're very lucky to have a caring family.

17
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:46,100
When can we go fishing?

18
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,100
Robbie, we'll go fishing soon, Robbie

19
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,100
and we'll take your dad with us.

20
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,100
I'm ready, Grandpa. You name the day.

21
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
That's a great idea, Grandpa!

22
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Philip needs a day off. Philip

23
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Let's give him our presents--now.

24
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,100
Good idea.

25
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,100
Presents--for me?

26
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:10,100
From me and Marilyn. Marilyn

27
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
And this one's from me.

28
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,100
I looked all over the house to find it.

29
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Richard, these are terrific pictures. Richard

30
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:44,100
This one really brings back memories.

31
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,100
You remember that day, Robbie?

32
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,100
I sure do. It was fun.

33
00:16:50,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Oh, I'm sorry Susan isn't here.

34
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
I miss her very much.

35
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,100
She feels bad, too, Grandpa.

36
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,100
She called to say the plane was delayed.

37
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,100
You know airports.

38
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
I can't wait to see her.

39
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,100
She looks just like Grandma at that age.

40
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,100
I'd better unpack.

41
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,100
I started traveling twenty-four hours ago.

42
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,100
I'm not so young anymore.

43
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,100
Don't you want something to eat?

44
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,100
No, thanks.

45
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,100
After a good night's sleep, I'll enjoy breakfast even more.

46
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
Well, come on, Dad.

47
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Ellen and I'll take you to your room. Ellen

48
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,100
I'm sure glad you're here, Grandpa.

49
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Good night, Grandpa.

50
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
Pleasant dreams.

51
00:17:46,100 --> 00:18:05,100
Philip, do you have the key to the trunk? Philip

52
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,100
I have the key, but it doesn't work.

53
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:17,100
I sent the wrong key.

54
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:33,100
I have something for you. I made it myself.

55
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,100
I think you'll enjoy it.

56
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,100
I researched it for over a year.

57
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,100
It's our family tree.

58
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:51,100
Oh, Grandpa! How exciting!

59
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Fabulous!

60
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,100
Why, I didn't know that your grandfather was born in Germany.

61
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,100
Lots of interesting information about our family.

62
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,100
A gift from me.

63
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,100
Thank you so much.

64
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Grandpa! Grandpa!

65
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,100
Oh, Grandpa, I'm so happy to see you!

66
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Oh, you look so beautiful, Susan. My granddaughter.

67
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:24,100
Like I always said, you look just like Grandma.

68
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,100
I think you're going to be very happy here with us.

69
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,100
I know you will.

70
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:46,100
I don't feel alone anymore.
