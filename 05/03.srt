Episode 03 - Grandpa's Trunk

1
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Marilyn, you want coffee or tea?

2
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Coffee, please.

3
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:10,600
I am so excited!

4
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
At this time tomorrow morning,

5
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Grandpa will be sitting in the kitchen with us.

6
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,600
When does he arrive?

7
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
At six o'clock this evening.

8
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
By plane?

9
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
No, by train.

10
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Are we picking him up at the station?

11
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Not Grandpa.

12
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
He doesn't want anybody picking him up.

13
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
He likes to be independent.

14
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Oh, let's go upstairs and prepare Grandpa's room.

15
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Great! Let's do it!

16
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Good morning, Mom.

17
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Morning.

18
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Well, hi, fellas.

19
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,000
Hello.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,600
Hi, honey.

21
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Morning, Marilyn.

22
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
We are going upstairs to set up Grandpa's room.

23
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
There's coffee ready.

24
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,600
I'm really excited about seeing Grandpa.

25
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Me, too. Milk, please.

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
He's so funny.

27
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
He always makes me laugh.

28
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I hope Grandpa's going to like living with us.

29
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I think he will.

30
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
It just takes time to feel comfortable in a new place.

31
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Won't he miss being in Florida?

32
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Well, he will.

33
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
But I think he'll like being here with the family.

34
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Are you sure about that?

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
It's crazy here most of the time.

36
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
But it's fun.

37
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
That's for sure.

38
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
You know,

39
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
maybe I'll put together some photos of Grandpa

40
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
as a "welcome" present.

41
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
That's a neat idea.

42
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
What can I do?

43
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
I've got it!

44
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,600
I have a picture of Grandpa and Dad and me in my wallet.

45
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,600
It's from the Fathers and Sons' Breakfast

46
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
at my junior high school graduation.

47
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Oh, I remember this picture.

48
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,600
I'd really like to pick up Grandpa at the railroad station.

49
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Railroad stations or airports--

50
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Grandpa always tells us he'll get here by himself.

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
He's something!

52
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Is this all Grandpa's stuff?

53
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
That's it.

54
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,600
But I'm sure he has a few bags with him on the train.

55
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
What's inside?

56
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,600
I don't know. It's locked.

57
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Hi.

58
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Oh, hi, darling.

59
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Morning, Philip.

60
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
I want to put some of my good hangers in Grandpa's closet.

61
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
You know I'm very excited about his arrival.

62
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
We are, too.

63
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Susan called early this morning.

64
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
She's unhappy

65
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
because she's had to go to Chicago on a business trip

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
and can't leave till tonight.

67
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
She wants to be here for Grandpa.

68
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Well, Grandpa will be disappointed, too.

69
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
He loves Susan.

70
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
She always reminds him of Grandma. Susan.

71
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Well, how's everything here?

72
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Fine. We were just wondering about this trunk.

73
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,600
It's locked.

74
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Oh. I have the key. Grandpa sent it to me.

1
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

2
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
No, it's not taken.

3
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Oh, thank you.

4
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Oh, let me help you with this.

5
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Oh, thank you.

6
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Do you want to sit by the window?

7
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
No, no, no. I like the aisle seat better.

8
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Please, you sit by the window.

9
00:07:51,600 --> 00:08:00,600
My name is Stewart... Malcolm Stewart.

10
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Pleased to meet you.

11
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
I'm Elsa Tobin. How do you do?

12
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Do you live in New York?

13
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
No, no. I'm from Florida.

14
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,600
I am, too. But didn't you just get on?

15
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,600
No, no. I just changed my seat.

16
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
A man next to me was smoking,

17
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,600
and smoke really bothers me.

18
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Where are you from in Florida?

19
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Titusville. It's near Orlando.

20
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Small world. I'm from Titusville, too.

21
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Really? What part?

22
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
My husband and I live near Spaceport.

23
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
I know that area.

24
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,600
My house is only a few miles from Spaceport.

25
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Do you still live there?

26
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Oh yes, yes. My husband's there now.

27
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,600
He couldn't take time off to come to New York with me.

28
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Do you still live there?

29
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,600
No. I sold the house and the furniture,

30
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,600
put a few personal things in an old trunk,

31
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,600
and shipped it to my children in New York.

32
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
That's my destination.

33
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Are you married?

34
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,600
My wife died four years ago.

35
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,600
She was a wonderful woman. A real friend.

36
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,600
I'm sorry. Really, I'm sorry.

37
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Lots of wonderful memories.

38
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,600
We were married almost fifty years.

39
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Well, forty-seven, to be exact.

40
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,600
John and I celebrate our fortieth anniversary next month.

41
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Oh, congratulations! That's nice.

42
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,600
What does John do?

43
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
He's an aerospace engineer

44
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
and works for Orlando Aircraft Corporation.

45
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,600
He started with them almost forty years ago.

46
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
What do you do?

47
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,600
I just retired. Had my own company.

48
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,600
A construction company. Roads, bridges, big stuff.

49
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,600
But I just sold it and retired.

50
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Excuse me, ma'am. Ticket, please.

51
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Would you kindly hold these keys, please?

52
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,600
I have a ticket, I know.

53
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
I was in the smoking section.

54
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
It's OK, lady. Take your time.

55
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,600
I'm sure it's in your purse, Mrs. Tobin.

56
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Oh, here it is.

57
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,600
And here are your keys.

58
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Thank you.

59
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Do you have family in New York?

60
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,600
No, no. But I do have very close friends in New York City.

61
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,600
We like to go to the theater together.

62
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,600
You said you have family in New York.

63
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Yes, indeed.

64
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,600
A son and his wife and their three children -

65
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
my grandchildren.

66
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
You must be excited.

67
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,600
I can't wait, to see them!

68
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Are you going to live with them?

69
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Yes.

70
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Permanently?

71
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Well... they want me to,

72
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,600
but it's too early to know for sure.

73
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I'm pretty independent.

74
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,600
I tried to teach my kids the importance of independence,

75
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,600
but I'm not sure I want to be alone.

76
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Some people don't mind being alone. I do.

77
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I understand. But tell me.

78
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Why did you stop working?

79
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:07,600
I retired because... I wanted to be with my family.

80
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,600
I didn't want to be alone anymore!

1
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Amtrak is happy to announce our arrival in New York City.

3
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,600
The train will be stopping in five minutes.

4
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Please check to be sure you have your belongings.

5
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
And have a good stay in the Big Apple.

6
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Thank you.

7
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Well, here we are.

8
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,600
It was so nice meeting you, Mr. Stewart.

9
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,600
And nice meeting you, too, Mrs. Tobin.

10
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Please look us up.

11
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
We're in the phone book.

12
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Dr. Philip Stewart, in Riverdale.

13
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Your son?

14
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,600
That's right. And have a good time in New York.

15
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,600
And don't be so independent.

16
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,600
You're very lucky to have a caring family.

17
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:55,600
When can we go fishing?

18
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Robbie, we'll go fishing soon,

19
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
and we'll take your dad with us.

20
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,600
I'm ready, Grandpa. You name the day.

21
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
That's a great idea, Grandpa!

22
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Philip needs a day off.

23
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Let's give him our presents now.

24
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Good idea.

25
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Presents, for me?

26
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,600
From me and Marilyn.

27
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
And this one's from me.

28
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,600
I looked all over the house to find it.

29
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Richard, these are terrific pictures.

30
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:53,600
This one really brings back memories.

31
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,600
You remember that day, Robbie?

32
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
I sure do. It was fun.

33
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Oh, I'm sorry Susan isn't here.

34
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
I miss her very much.

35
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,600
She feels bad, too, Grandpa.

36
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,600
She called to say the plane was delayed.

37
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
You know airports.

38
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
I can't wait to see her.

39
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,600
She looks just like Grandma at that age.

40
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,600
I'd better unpack.

41
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,600
I started traveling twenty-four hours ago.

42
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,600
I'm not so young anymore.

43
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Don't you want something to eat?

44
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
No, thanks.

45
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
After a good night's sleep, I'll enjoy breakfast even more.

46
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Well, come on, Dad.

47
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Ellen and I'll take you to your room.

48
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
I'm sure glad you're here, Grandpa.

49
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Good night, Grandpa.

50
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Pleasant dreams.

51
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Philip, do you have the key to the trunk?

52
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,600
I have the key, but it doesn't work.

53
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:26,600
I sent the wrong key.

54
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:42,600
I have something for you. I made it myself.

55
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
I think you'll enjoy it.

56
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,600
I researched it for over a year.

57
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
It's our family tree.

58
00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Oh, Grandpa! How exciting!

59
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Fabulous!

60
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Why, I didn't know that your grandfather was born in Germany.

61
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Lots of interesting information about our family.

62
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
A gift from me.

63
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Thank you so much.

64
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Grandpa! Grandpa!

65
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Oh, Grandpa, I'm so happy to see you!

66
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Oh, you look so beautiful, Susan. My granddaughter.

67
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Like I always said, you look just like Grandma.

68
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,600
I think you're going to be very happy here with us.

69
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I know you will.

70
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:55,600
I don't feel alone anymore.
