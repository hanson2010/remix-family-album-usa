Episode 20 - Quality Time

1
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Where's Mom?

2
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
She went to a school-board meeting.

3
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,600
I don't know how she does it.

4
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
She sure keeps busy.

5
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
It's important to her.

6
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
There are lots of places to go,

7
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
lots of things to do.

8
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,600
She can't sit around and do nothing.

9
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Philip works late.

10
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
I guess you're right.

11
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
I wish I had her energy.

12
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Anybody home?

13
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
We're in here, Dad.

14
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Oh. Hi, gang.

15
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Hello, Philip.

16
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
How was your day?

17
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
My day was just fine.

18
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
So was my night.

19
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
It's almost ten o'clock.

20
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Mmm. I'm starving.

21
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Um... where's Mom?

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
She went to a school-board meeting.

23
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
There's a note for you on the refrigerator.

24
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Oh?

25
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Did you have dinner, Robbie?

26
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Yeah.

27
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Mike and I had a hamburger at the diner.

28
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
I came home a little while ago.

29
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
You've been working late

30
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
almost every night this week, Dad.

31
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Aren't you exhausted?

32
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,600
I don't have time to be exhausted.

33
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
You and Mom haven't had dinner together with us

34
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
in almost a full week.

35
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Yeah,

36
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
I feel bad

37
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
about us not having dinner with the family,

38
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
but our schedules are so different.

39
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Either I'm at the hospital doing paperwork,

40
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
or Mom is at a committee meeting.

41
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I frankly don't know what to do about it.

42
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
I'm worried about you and Mom.

43
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,600
You really have been working too hard.

44
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Well,

45
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
I think I've had enough of that sandwich.

46
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
You didn't finish it.

47
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,600
It's not good to eat before going to bed.

48
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
A cookie can't hurt, though.

49
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Well,

50
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
I'm heading off for bed

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
and a good night's sleep.

52
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Well, good night.

53
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Good night, Son.

54
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Good night, Dad.

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
I'm going to bed.

56
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Good night, Philip.

57
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Haven't you finished balancing that checkbook?

58
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
I found another mistake.

59
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,600
I'll be off to bed myself in a minute.

60
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
OK. Good night.

61
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:55,600
I'm really concerned about them,

62
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Grandpa.

63
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Concerned about whom?

64
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
About Mom and Dad.

65
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
They hardly ever see each other.

66
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Dad often works late,

67
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
and Mom has all these committees she's on.

68
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,600
What do you propose to do about it?

69
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
You have that look in your eye.

70
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
I don't know,

71
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
but there must be a way

72
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
of getting them to spend more time together.

73
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Quality time.

1
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Hello there, Robbie.

2
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
What are you doing up this late?

3
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Reading.

4
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Reading?

5
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
At this hour?

6
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Ah, come on, Robbie.

7
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
What are you doing up this late?

8
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,600
Things on my mind.

9
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Do you care to talk about them?

10
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Sure,

11
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
if you don't mind listening.

12
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Robbie, Robbie, remember me?

13
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
I'm your mother.

14
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,600
If you have something you want to talk about,

15
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
I'm always prepared to listen.

16
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,600
You haven't been around much lately.

17
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,600
So that's it.

18
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
OK, let's talk.

19
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,600
You and Dad are like ships that pass in the night.

20
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Dad works hard, and he works late.

21
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
You work hard on all your committees,

22
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
and you work late.

23
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
I thought you were proud of the work I do.

24
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
I am, Mom.

25
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Real proud.

26
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,600
You are one fantastic mom,

27
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,600
but ... but I've been noticing

28
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
how little quality time

29
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
you spend with Dad and me... and the family.

30
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,600
It's a real problem, Robbie.

31
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
I know it.

32
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,600
I'm concerned.

33
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
There must be a way

34
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,600
that Dad and you can spend more time together.

35
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Well, we always talk about

36
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
taking a vacation together with the family.

37
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,600
I think you ought to

38
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,600
take a vacation away from the family, alone.

39
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Kind of a second honeymoon.

40
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,600
It would be wonderful,

41
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
but our schedules won't allow it.

42
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
I think I have an idea.

43
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
You do?

44
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Yup.

45
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
I think I have an idea

46
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
that will bring Dad and you

47
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
together in a more scheduled way.

48
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
What is it?

49
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Well,

50
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
you know how Dad is always talking about

51
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
the kids in the ward

52
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,600
and how important it is for them to be paid attention to?

53
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Yes.

54
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Well...

55
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
and how hard it is

56
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
because the doctors and nurses are so busy?

57
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Yes.

58
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Well, how would it be if you took some time

59
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
to work with Dad towards solving that problem?

60
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
I don't get it.

61
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Like setting up a regular weekly reading program.

62
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
You and Dad.

63
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
You and Dr. Philip Stewart--

64
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
going to the children's ward once or twice a week

65
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
and reading to them.

66
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Not bad.

67
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Not a bad idea, Robbie.

68
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
As a matter of fact,

69
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
it fits right in with something I'm working on right now

70
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
with the school-board committee.

71
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
What's that?

72
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
I've been trying

73
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
to work out a program

74
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
in the public school

75
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,600
that will bring parents and teachers together once a week

76
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,600
to read to the students - their own children, really.

77
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
By doing that, it will encourage reading.

78
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,600
So it might fit in with a program

79
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
for reading to the kids in the hospital.

80
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
You're right.

81
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
We'll do it!

82
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
I'm going to talk to Daddy about it right now.

83
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,600
But Dad was so exhausted when he came home from work.

84
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Why don't you talk to him about it tomorrow?

85
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,600
You are a very smart young man, Robbie.

86
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,600
I think I'll wait until tomorrow.

87
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
You won't forget, will you?

88
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Believe me, I won't.

89
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
It is a great idea,

90
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
and I promise you I won't forget.

91
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Thanks, Mom.

92
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Thank you, Robbie.

1
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Good morning.

2
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
What a wonderful morning!

3
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Don't the flowers smell wonderful?

4
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Good morning, Ellen.

5
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Yes, they do.

6
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,600
That's why I'm reading my paper and having my coffee

7
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
on the patio this morning.

8
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Ah, it does smell sweet.

9
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,600
How was your school-board meeting last night?

10
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
You must've come home very late.

11
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Did you find the sandwich I made for you?

12
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Thanks, dear.

13
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,600
I was so tired

14
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
I didn't even finish it.

15
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Philip, I've been working on this special project

16
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
with the school board,

17
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
and I'd like your opinion about it.

18
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
What is it?

19
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
I've been trying to find

20
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
a way to encourage reading.

21
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Good luck!

22
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Well, I think I may have found a way to do it.

23
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Tell me about it.

24
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,600
I work with families every day, Ellen.

25
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
I see how people spend their leisure time,

26
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
young and old.

27
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Mostly watching television.

28
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Well, that would be OK

29
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
if, and I repeat,

30
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
if people took the time to read.

31
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
I couldn't agree with you more.

32
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
The question is,

33
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,600
how do we get them to read more?

34
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
I think

35
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,600
you're going to give me the answer to that question.

36
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
You have that look in your eye.

37
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
I do have an answer, Philip.

38
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Or at least I think I do.

39
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Well, tell me about it.

40
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
The plan is a simple one.

41
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Involve the entire family in a reading project.

42
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
In the home?

43
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Yes, in the home.

44
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
But first in the school-rooms.

45
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Hmm, interesting.

46
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,600
But how do you plan to do that?

47
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
By arranging with the public schools

48
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,600
to schedule one hour a week to start with.

49
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
During that time

50
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
parents are invited to attend--

51
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,600
and to read along with the children - their children.

52
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,600
It can go beyond the school system, Ellen.

53
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Really?

54
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:30,600
I guarantee you it would go very well in the hospitals.

55
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
My patients, mostly kids,

56
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
would love to read and be read to.

57
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
You think so?

58
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
I know so.

59
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Maybe we can experiment with your patients

60
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,600
and see how the plan works.

61
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
I love the idea.

62
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Would you work with me on it?

63
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,600
I would love to, Philip.

64
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,600
And that way,

65
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,600
we'll spend more time together, Ellen.

66
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,600
We just don't see each other anymore.

67
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,600
You and I are very busy these days.

68
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
This is true.

69
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
We need to find time to be together more,

70
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
to do things together more, you and I.

71
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,600
This would be a wonderful way to accomplish that.

72
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
I have a question.

73
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Yes?

74
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,600
What do we read?

75
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
To the patients in the ward?

76
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Yes.

77
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Well,

78
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
let you and I talk about it.

79
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,600
What would you like to read to them?

80
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Mrs. Stewart and I Stewart

81
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
will read a poem by Robert Frost.

82
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
It's called

83
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening".

84
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Would you begin, Ellen?

85
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
All right.

86
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,600
"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"

87
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,600
by Robert Frost.

88
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Whose woods these are I think I know.

89
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
His house is in the village though;

90
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
He will not see me stopping here

91
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
To watch his woods fill up with snow.

92
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,600
My little horse must think it queer

93
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
To stop without a farmhouse near

94
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Between the woods and frozen lake

95
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,600
The darkest evening of the year.

96
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
He gives his harness bells a shake

97
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
To ask if there is some mistake.

98
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,600
The only other sound's the sweep

99
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Of easy wind and downy flake.

100
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,600
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,

101
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
But I have promises to keep,

102
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,600
And miles to go before I sleep,

103
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,600
And miles to go before I sleep.

104
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:03,600
You two belong on stage! That was wonderful!

105
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Grandpa!

106
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Dad... Robbie. When did you come?

107
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
We've been listening to you both.

108
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
These are lucky kids.

109
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Do you enjoy reading together?

110
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Well, we may read together aloud at home.

111
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
You were right, Robbie.

112
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
I know.
