Episode 09 - It's Up to You

1
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Who is it?

2
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Dad.

3
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Come on in, Dad.

4
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,600
I thought you might be hungry.

5
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,600
I brought you a chicken sandwich and a glass of milk.

6
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
I am hungry.

7
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Thanks, Dad.

8
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
What time is it, anyway?

9
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Ten o'clock.

10
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
What are you working on?

11
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,600
I'm writing a story for the high-school paper.

12
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Can't you finish it tomorrow?

13
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,600
No, I have to turn it in in the morning.

14
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
What's it about?

15
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,600
I'm writing an article on the feelings about graduation.

16
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,600
And ... how do you feel?

17
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Me?

18
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
A little scared.

19
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
And excited, too.

20
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,600
I felt the same way.

21
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
The scary part's leaving home and moving to college.

22
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Oh, leaving home is part of growing up.

23
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Well, don't work all night.

24
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
I don't mind.

25
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I enjoy writing.

26
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Well,

27
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
maybe you should think about becoming a writer.

28
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Maybe I should.

29
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,600
You have lots of time to decide.

30
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
That's the worst part--making decisions.

31
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
You'll be OK.

32
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Good night, Son.

33
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Good night, Dad.

34
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:23,600
"Hail to the victors valiant,

35
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Hail to the conquering heroes,

36
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Hail, Hail to Michigan,

37
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
The champions of the West!"

38
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Ah, good morning, Robbie.

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Good morning, Dad.

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
How's my grandson?

41
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Fine, Grandpa. Fine!

42
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
What's all the cheering about?

43
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Did the University of Michigan win another football game?

44
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Better than that.

45
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Tell him, Philip.

46
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
I just spoke with Charley Rafer.

47
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Who's Charley Rafer?

48
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,600
He's the Dean of Admissions for the University of Michigan.

49
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
And it turns out he's a classmate of Philip's.

50
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
We were both on the tennis team.

51
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Great!

52
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
It is great.

53
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
He's going to be in New York tomorrow

54
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
to interview applicants for admission.

55
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
And he's agreed to fit you into his schedule.

56
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
But I may not want to go to Michigan.

57
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,600
It's one of the best schools in the country, Robbie.

58
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
I studied medicine there.

59
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Your grandfather went to the Engineering School there.

60
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
I know that, but ...

61
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
You said you wanted to be a doctor like your father.

62
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Not exactly.

63
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,600
You couldn't pick a finer medical school than Michigan.

64
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Yes, I know that.

65
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Let's meet with Charley at the university club.

66
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

67
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,600
It doesn't mean you're going to Michigan.

68
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
It doesn't mean you have to be a doctor.

69
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,600
But the interview will be good experience for you.

70
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
In that case, it's OK.

71
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Dad, growing up means

72
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
making my own decisions, doesn't it?

73
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,600
You're right, Robbie.

74
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
But, like your Grandpa suggested,

75
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,600
have the interview.

76
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,600
And then make your own decision.

77
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,600
That sounds fine.

78
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
I know it's sudden, Robbie,

79
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
but this is an important opportunity.

80
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
We'll head down there first thing tomorrow morning.

81
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
OK?

82
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Sure, Dad.

83
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,600
I want you to know something, Son.

84
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,600
I'm ... very proud of you.

85
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Thanks, Dad.

86
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Well, I've got an appointment at the hospital.

87
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
I'll see you all at dinnertime.

88
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Bye, Dad.

89
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Is something still wrong, Robbie?

90
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
I'll be OK.

91
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Going away to college for the first time

92
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,600
always makes one a little nervous.

93
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
I guess so.

94
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I'll be OK. I just need time to think.

1
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,100
Sorry, Robbie.

2
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,100
Sorry to be late this morning,but,

3
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,100
well, we've still got some time for a cup of coffee

4
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,100
I can't wait to see my old pal Charley Rafer.

5
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,100
Neither can I.

6
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:12,100
So you thought about it, huh?

7
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Yes, I have, Dad.

8
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Well, I'm glad.

9
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100
I knew you'd realize

10
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,100
that this interview could be an important experience for you.

11
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,100
I came to that conclusion.

12
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,100
That's very wise, Robbie.

13
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
Very wise.

14
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,100
Now let's head off for the city and the university club.

15
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Thanks, Dad.

16
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
Thanks ... for what?

17
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
Thanks for hearing me out. And ...

18
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
And ...?

19
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,100
And thanks for being such an understanding father.

20
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Well, thank you, Robbie. Thank you.

21
00:09:45,100 --> 00:10:00,100
Philip Stewart! Philip Stewart

22
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,100
It's great to see you!

23
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Charley Rafer--you look as young as ever. Charley Rafer

24
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,100
You must be Robbie.

25
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,100
Hi.

26
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Yes, this is my youngest son Robbie.

27
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Robbie, I want you to meet Robbie

28
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,100
one of the best tennis players on the Michigan team--

29
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
Charley Rafer. Charley Rafer

30
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
Nice to meet you, Dean Rafer.

31
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,100
Well, are you as good a tennis player as your dad?

32
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
No, I'm not very good at it.

33
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Frankly, neither was I.

34
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Charley was the star of the team. Charley

35
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
Yeah. Thanks.

36
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,100
Well, how're you been, Philip?

37
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Oh, working too hard.

38
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Doesn't show.

39
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
How's Ellen? Ellen

40
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Fine, thank you.

41
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,100
And how's Marge? Marge

42
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,100
She's still giving the toughest English history exams

43
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,100
in the school and loving every minute of it.

44
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
And speaking of minutes,

45
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
I have interviews until noon,

46
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
so why don't we get right to work?

47
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Can you have lunch with us later?

48
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,100
I'd love to, Philip, but I'm afraid I can't.

49
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100
I'm only here two days,

50
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,100
and I have interviews with twenty-six applicants.

51
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
I understand.

52
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,100
Well, thanks.

53
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,100
I'll wait outside.

54
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,100
Good luck, Son.

55
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,100
Did you bring your transcript from high school?

56
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Yes, sir.

57
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Right here.

58
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,100
Thank you.

59
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Please sit down.

60
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,100
I see under "activities" that

61
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
you've been writing for the school paper.

62
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
Yes, sir.

63
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,100
What kinds of articles have you written?

64
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,100
All kinds--sports, editorials, theater reviews.

65
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
You name it, I've written it.

66
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
Hmmm.

67
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Well, have you ever thought of becoming a journalist?

68
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
A professional writer?

69
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Not until recently.

70
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Michigan has a fine School of Journalism. Michigan

71
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Yes, I know that.

72
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,100
You seem to have some reservations.

73
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,100
I'm a little uncertain.

74
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,100
It's been very nice talking to you.

75
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,100
Nice talking to you, sir.

76
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
One piece of advice.

77
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:13,100
The most important thing is for you to decide your own future.

78
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,100
Yes, sir.

79
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,100
Good-bye, Dean Rafer.

80
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Good-bye, Robbie.

81
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Good luck.

1
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,500
I had an interview today, too.

2
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
I had a great interview

3
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,100
with Admissions at Columbia University.

4
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Really?

5
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
What did they say?

6
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
Will you get into the school?

7
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
Well, they didn't say anything for sure.

8
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,100
But I figure that with my grades and with my personality,

9
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,100
I'll have no problem.

10
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Columbia's a terrific school. Columbia

11
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
What are you going to do?

12
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,100
Do? I don't know.

13
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
I also applied to NYU.

14
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,100
You sound excited about Columbia.

15
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
What's your problem, Mike?

16
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Indecision. Indecision.

17
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,100
It's not easy,

18
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
and this is an important decision we have to make.

19
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
What about you?

20
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,100
How was your interview with Michigan?

21
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
The interview was fine.

22
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,100
It's a great college.

23
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,100
It is.

24
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,100
My father would like me to go there.

25
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,100
He and my Grandpa both went there.

26
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,100
Great medical school, too.

27
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
I know.

28
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
You can follow in your father's footsteps.

29
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Ah! I'd like to follow in my own footsteps, Mike.

30
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,100
What do you want to study?

31
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,100
I've been thinking.

32
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
I think I want to study journalism

33
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,100
to be a reporter--a newspaperman.

34
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
You do a pretty good job on the Riverdale High School paper.

35
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,100
And I've been thinking about it a lot lately.

36
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Have you discussed it with your parents?

37
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,100
No. But I have to.

38
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
OK. Let's talk.

39
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Hi, Son. Is everything all right?

40
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,100
Hi, Dad. Everything's fine.

41
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,100
I was just waiting for you to get home

42
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,100
so we could talk.

43
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
Anything special you want to talk about?

44
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,100
There is, Dad.

45
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,100
I'm listening.

46
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,100
Well, I know you and Mom have given up a lot

47
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:57,100
to save money for my college tuition.

48
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,100
We want you to go to college, Robbie.

49
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,100
I know. I do.

50
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
But?

51
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Well, I've thought a lot about which college,

52
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,100
and one of them is Columbia.

53
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Columbia? Why Columbia? Columbia

54
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,100
First, they have an excellent School of Journalism.

55
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,100
They do.

56
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:27,100
And your friends are planning to go to Columbia?

57
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,100
That's only part of it.

58
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,100
It's complicated.

59
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,100
I'll try to explain.

60
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Mike and I had a hamburger this afternoon, and we talked.

61
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
Yes?

62
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,100
Well, we talked about a lot of things.

63
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
He applied to Columbia,

64
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
and his interview was very successful.

65
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
He thinks he'll be accepted,

66
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
and he really wants to go there.

67
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Dean Rafer called me today. Rafer

68
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,100
He told me he was very impressed with you.

69
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
He's a nice man.

70
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
He was very kind.

71
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
He told me

72
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,100
you had some doubts about wanting to go to Michigan.

73
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Yes. I do.

74
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,100
I'm just not sure about what I want to do.

75
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,100
That's OK.

76
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,100
You understand?

77
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,100
Let me tell you something, Robbie.

78
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:30,100
Something that might be surprising to you.

79
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,100
What? Tell me.

80
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Well, Grandpa wanted me to study engineering, like him.

81
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,100
Well, I wasn't clear about my future,

82
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:51,100
but I knew engineering was not for me.

83
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,100
What did you tell Grandpa?

84
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
The truth.

85
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,100
Then you're not upset

86
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,100
about my not wanting to go into medicine?

87
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,100
I'm not upset at all.

88
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,100
I'm just happy that we're able to talk about it.

89
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,100
I am too, Dad.

90
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:18,100
I suppose you want to apply to Columbia.

91
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,100
Yes, but I also want to apply to several other colleges.

92
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,100
I thought you wanted to go to Columbia.

93
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Well, I might want to go to Columbia.

94
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,100
But I might not.

95
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,100
I just want to be able to make my own decision.

96
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,100
You're a real Stewart!

97
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,100
And if I think about it long enough, you never know ...

98
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
Never know what?

99
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,100
If I make my own decision,

100
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,100
I might choose Michigan.

101
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Robbie, you're something! Robbie

102
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,100
You know, when I was your age,

103
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,100
I said exactly the same thing to Grandpa.
