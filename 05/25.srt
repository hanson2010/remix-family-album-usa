Episode 25 - Country Music

1
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Hot dogs. I love hot dogs.

2
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
There is nothing better than a hot dog in the country.

3
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Hot dogs and mustard.

4
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Cooked outdoors over an open fire.

5
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
I wish I had one now.

6
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Do you remember when Daddy and I used to take you

7
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
and Susan and Robbie to Jones Beach?

8
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Oh, I sure do.

9
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
We'd wait until dark and make a fire,

10
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
and we'd cook the hot dogs.

11
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Oh, don't forget the mustard.

12
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
And, oh, does anybody want ketchup?

13
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
I might as well take it along.

14
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
And now to make sure we've got the hamburger patties.

15
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:44,600
I have to remember to put them in the bag

16
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
tomorrow morning before we leave.

17
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
I'll remind you, Richard.

18
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Mom,

19
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
we really appreciate your taking care of Max for the weekend

20
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
and giving up your free time.

21
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
I love doing it.

22
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Susan and Harry have a sitter for Michelle in the city,

23
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,600
and I'm taking care of Max.

24
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
It's no big deal.

25
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I am happy to do it for you.

26
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
I guess Max is asleep by now.

27
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
He's not crying anymore.

28
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Oh, poor baby. He's teething.

29
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Well, he's asleep, finally.

30
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,600
I feel so bad for him.

31
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,600
It hurts so much when a baby gets his first teeth.

32
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
He'll be fine, Marilyn.

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Well, he wakes up several times during the night,

34
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
and the pain is so bad.

35
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
I'm really concerned about going away for the weekend, Ellen,

36
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,600
and leaving you with the full responsibility of taking care of Max.

37
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Especially with his teething.

38
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
I wish he felt better.

39
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Please don't worry, Marilyn.

40
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Remember your father-in-law's a pediatrician.

41
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,600
We have a live-in doctor if there's a problem I can't handle.

42
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I agree, Marilyn.

43
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
We really don't have to be overly concerned.

44
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,600
I'll go upstairs and stay with him until he falls asleep again.

45
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Thanks, Richard.

46
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Try putting him across your lap on his stomach.

47
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
He likes that.

48
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I'll try it.

49
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
When are Susan and Harry picking you up, Marilyn?

50
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
They're coming by at six tomorrow morning,

51
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
so we can get an early start.

52
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
That's nice.

53
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
And you'll have a full day in the country.

54
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
And a full night.

55
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Tomorrow night we'll be camping out in tents.

56
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,600
And coming home on Sunday?

57
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
We'll be heading back late in the afternoon.

58
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,600
You're going to have the time of your lives.

59
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Camping out is such great fun.

60
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
We'll have a great time camping out, I'm sure.

61
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
But I'm still a little worried about you, Ellen.

62
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
It will be my great pleasure, Marilyn.

63
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Remember, it's only one night.

64
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
He's asleep.

65
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,600
I think he'll sleep through the night now.

66
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Thanks, honey.

67
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,600
I hope he's good when we're away.

68
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Well, so do I.

69
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Now, to check the list of things we need for the camping trip.

70
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,600
We need to bring a flashlight.

71
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,600
It's in the right-hand drawer, next to the bottle openers.

72
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Do we have a bottle opener on the list, Marilyn?

73
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,600
No. No bottle opener.

74
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Is that one of the things Susan and Harry are bringing?

75
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
No.

76
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,600
And we're bringing the ketchup, mustard, relish, all that stuff.

77
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
And cooking utensils.

78
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Well, here's the bottle opener, and here's the flashlight.

79
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Matches.

80
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Matches.

81
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Yes, of course.

82
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
For when we build our campfire.

83
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,600
I can't build a fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together.

84
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,600
And don't forget your camera and film, Richard.

85
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
All packed and ready.

86
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,600
And let's not forget our cassette player and some tapes.

87
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Some music tapes and some blank tapes

88
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
so that we can record our thoughts about the trip.

89
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Oh, that's a nice idea.

90
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
An audio diary.

91
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
That's what I thought.

92
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Got it!

93
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
The cassette player and the tapes.

1
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Oh, I love it!

2
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
I love it!

3
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,600
To be away from the city on such a beautiful day

4
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,600
is my idea of heaven!

5
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,600
The grass. The trees. The fresh air.

6
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,600
I told you you'd like it. I've been doing this for years.

7
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
You have the spirit of a teenager, Susan.

8
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Wait till you see yourself jumping around.

9
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
That's what I love about Susan.

10
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
She works hard.

11
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
She plays hard.

12
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
She's a real Stewart.

13
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Come on, Richard.

14
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Help me get this stuff out of the car.

15
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Where does it go?

16
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Well, we'll put everything over there.

17
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,600
We'll set up our tents over there by the edge of the woods.

18
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Then we'll be able to make our fire there where it's safe.

19
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Oh, there's our table and benches.

20
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
All set for eating.

21
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
That's what makes this spot so good.

22
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Is anybody hungry?

23
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
I am.

24
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
We just got here.

25
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,600
When you're out in the fresh air like this, it makes you hungry.

26
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Aren't you hungry, Marilyn?

27
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
I sure am.

28
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
How about you, Richard?

29
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Starving.

30
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
You guys are like three kids.

31
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Aren't you hungry, Harry?

32
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Well, yeah.

33
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Now that you mention it, I guess I am.

34
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
I mean,

35
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
how could a guy not be hungry with all this talk about eating?

36
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Where's the bag with the chicken salad sandwiches?

37
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Right here, next to the ice packs. Here.

38
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Put the tablecloth on the picnic table,

39
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,600
and I will bring the cola and the plastic cups.

40
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Well, how do you like it so far?

41
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
I've never been more relaxed.

42
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Me, neither.

43
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,600
I wish we had brought Michelle, Harry.

44
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
She would have loved it.

45
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Oh, you're right.

46
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
I wish we had brought Max.

47
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Marilyn, Susan, let's not begin to worry about Michelle and Max.

48
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,600
We're having a good time, and they're in good hands.

49
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Richard is right.

50
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Are you having a good time, Susan?

51
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
You haven't answered my question.

52
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I am having a good time, Harry.

53
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,600
I promise not to think about the city.

54
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
We're in the country.

55
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Let's all just enjoy this wonderful place

56
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
and this wonderful weather.

57
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Good.

58
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,600
This is heaven, Harry!

59
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,600
It was such a great idea to spend the weekend this way.

60
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Thanks, Susan.

61
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
I thought you'd all like it.

62
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Like it?

63
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Listen to the sounds of the summer that surround us.

64
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
It's so calming.

65
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I've always liked camping out.

66
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Away from the telephones and account books.

67
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,600
It's refreshing for me.

68
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
I always go back to the city in a wonderful state of mind.

69
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,600
We've only been here for a day,

70
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,600
and I've completely forgotten about all my business problems.

71
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,600
The office seems so far away.

72
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
I'm glad you like it, Susan.

73
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
We'll spend many more weekends like this.

74
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,600
And next time we'll bring Michelle.

75
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,600
I wish she were here with us to enjoy the country.

76
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,600
And next time we'll bring Michelle.

77
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Just listen to the sound.

78
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,600
It's so soothing.

79
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,600
I can hardly keep my eyes open.

80
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,600
If only we could bottle the fresh air.

81
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Wouldn't it be wonderful?

82
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,600
We could call it "Deep Sleep Country Air."

83
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,600
It puts you to sleep.

84
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,600
So does the sound.

85
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:36,600
I've been having a hard time keeping my eyes open

86
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
just listening to it.

87
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,600
It's like a special music.

88
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Too bad we can't bottle the sound.

89
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,600
But we can!

90
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Can what?

91
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Bottle the sound.

92
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
What are you talking about?

93
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Oh, yeah?

94
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Great idea!

95
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Let's do it!

1
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,600
I'm so glad everyone is asleep.

2
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
I thought Max would be crying, and everybody would be awake.

3
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
What did I tell you?

4
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Nothing to worry about.

5
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
I'm sure everything is fine.

6
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
My mother knows all there is to know

7
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
about taking care of babies, I assure you.

8
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Let's put some of this stuff away and then take off.

9
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
We've got a forty-minute drive into the city.

10
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Welcome home,

11
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
and I do mean welcome home.

12
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Something wrong?

13
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Oh, nothing's wrong, Richard.

14
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Believe me, Max is fine.

15
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,600
But his teeth hurt, and he just can't get to sleep, poor dear.

16
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,600
Neither can you.

17
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Oh, I feel so bad.

18
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Oh, I'm fine.

19
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
How was your weekend?

20
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
We had a great time, Mom.

21
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
It was wonderful.

22
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
The weather couldn't have been better.

23
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,600
It was nice here, too.

24
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
Did you get a chance to get outside at all?

25
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Oh, yes.

26
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Grandpa helped me yesterday afternoon.

27
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
I went to the supermarket to get a few things,

28
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,600
and I stayed out an extra half hour.

29
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
The village was filled with people. The weather was so nice.

30
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Harry's a professional camper, Mom.

31
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
He knows all there is to know,

32
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
and he made the weekend very easy for us to enjoy.

33
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Come on. You all helped.

34
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
You were wonderful, Harry!

35
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Why don't you go to your room, Mom, and get some sleep.

36
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Oh, I'm fine.

37
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Tell me more about your weekend.

38
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Did you do anything special?

39
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Lots of special country things.

40
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
We picked flowers.

41
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
And we brought some home for you.

42
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,600
It was so nice to be out in the country.

43
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,600
They smell wonderful.

44
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Everything smelled so special.

45
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,600
It would have been great if we had been able to bottle the smells.

46
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
It would be a great business if you could do that.

47
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Oh!

48
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Uh, we're home now, Ellen.

49
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
We'll take care of it.

50
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
I'll take care of it.

51
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Let's see if it works.

52
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
What's that?

53
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,600
A little special country music.

54
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,600
I think we'd better head home.

55
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
It's getting late, and we have a bit of a drive.

56
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Well, all your things are inside.

57
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
There's your sleeping bag.

58
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Oh, thanks, Harry.

59
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Say good-bye to Richard.

60
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
We'll call you all tomorrow night.

61
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Good-bye.

62
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Bye, Mom.

63
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:30,600
I'm so tired I think I'm overtired.

64
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,600
I don't know if I can get to sleep.

65
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Max has stopped crying.

66
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Yes. It works!

67
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
It works!

68
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,600
What works?

69
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
This.

70
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Oh. Oh, where did you get that?

71
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,600
It sounds so nice.

72
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:21,600
I think I'm falling asleep.

73
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Like Max did.

74
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Good night.

75
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Sounds of the country.

76
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,600
The soothing sounds of the country.
