Episode 26 - Opening Night

1
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
A little further to the right, Tom.

2
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Is this OK?

3
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Good. What do you think, Richard?

4
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
I like it there.

5
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,600
It's the first thing people will see when they come in.

6
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
It sets the tone for the whole show.

7
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
The next thing they'll see is

8
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,600
this enlargement with the words Family Album, U.S.A.

9
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,600
I can't believe this is really happening!

10
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
You've earned it.

11
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Years of work went into these pictures.

12
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,600
I know, but it's still a dream come true.

13
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Well, remember,

14
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
we're not sure

15
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
what the critics are going to write about your show yet.

16
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
And you never know

17
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,600
what the man from the New York Times is going to say about it.

18
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Are you worried?

19
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
I always worry.

20
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
The reviews of this show

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
are important for the sales of your book.

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
When do we see the reviews?

23
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Soon.

24
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
One of the critics is coming over this morning for a preview.

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I hope he's in a good mood.

26
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
So do I.

27
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Marilyn and I hope to use money from the sales of this book

28
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
to buy a new house.

29
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
The book will be a success.

30
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
And the show will help promote it.

31
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Speaking of promoting the book,

32
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
do I really have to

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
autograph copies for the guests at the opening?

34
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
It's common practice.

35
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,600
I feel uncomfortable about it.

36
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
A lot of people come to openings

37
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
just so they can get

38
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,600
the autograph of somebody who may be famous someday.

39
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Couldn't we wait until I'm famous?

40
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
That might be sooner than you think.

41
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
This one over here, Mr. Carlson?

42
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,600
A little further back, Tom.

43
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
It's too close to the refreshments.

44
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
No, I think this one belongs in the "people-at-work" section.

45
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,600
You may be right.

46
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Try it there, Tom.

47
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Right.

48
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Nervous about the opening tonight?

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Nervous?

50
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,600
No. I'm scared to death.

51
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
How about guests?

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
How many people will you be bringing?

53
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Well, my family, I guess.

54
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
My wife Marilyn, my father and mother,

55
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
my brother Robbie,

56
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
my sister and her husband and their daughter.

57
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
And my grandfather.

58
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Is that too many?

59
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
No such thing as "too many" at an opening.

60
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
I hope they like it.

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Your family or the public?

62
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Everybody.

63
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
But especially my family.

64
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
They've stood by me through all this.

65
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
I'm sure they'll like it.

66
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Harvey, how are you?

67
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Mitchell, so nice of you to come.

68
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Richard, this is Mitchell Johnson.

69
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Mitchell is

70
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
one of the most important syndicated reviewers in the country.

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Well, you're the young man who did all this.

72
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
I'm afraid so.

73
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Nice to meet you.

74
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Nice to meet you, Mr. Johnson.

75
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Mitchell has always encouraged new talent.

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Well ... you mind if I look around

77
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
and see what it says to me?

78
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Be our guest.

79
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Mm-hmm, hmm, uh-huh.

80
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:35,600
What does that mean when he goes,

81
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm"?

82
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
It probably means he's clearing his throat.

83
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
I don't know.

84
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
I don't care what the critics say, Mr. Stewart.

85
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Your work is brilliant.

86
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Thank you, Tom.

87
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Tom is studying photography at NYU. Tom

88
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,600
He's working with me during the summer months as an intern.

89
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Oh, really?

90
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
I'd like to see your work.

91
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
It's not good enough to show.

92
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
I'm still learning.

93
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Oh, I'd still like to see your work.

94
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
You may be the next Ansel Adams and not even know it.

95
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
If you really mean it,

96
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
I'll bring some of my pictures into the gallery.

97
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
I do mean it.

98
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Very interesting pictures, Mr. Stewart.

99
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
You have a most unusual eye.

100
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Thank you.

101
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
I hope that's a compliment.

102
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
It is.

103
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Are you going to be reviewing the show, Mitchell?

104
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Oh, yes. It's definitely worth reviewing.

105
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Favorably?

106
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Oh, you know I never answer that question, Harvey.

107
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
I'd like an advance copy of the book, though,

108
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
so I can study it.

109
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,600
I have an autographed one in my office.

110
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Tom, would you give Mr. Johnson

111
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
the copy of Richard's book on my desk?

112
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Just follow me, Mr. Johnson.

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Sure.

114
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Do you think he liked my photographs?

115
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
We'll know when tonight's papers come out.

116
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Keep your fingers crossed.

1
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Do you like the dress?

2
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
I love it.

3
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
I designed it myself.

4
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
It's beautiful.

5
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Are you ready?

6
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
We're supposed to be there

7
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
before the guests arrive.

8
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
I know. I know.

9
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Help me with this tie, will you?

10
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Honey, I'm scared to death.

11
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,600
But this is what you've been working for all these years.

12
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
No, no.

13
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
I worked to put together a book of photographs.

14
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
This is show business.

15
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Well, it's all part of the same job.

16
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Just relax and enjoy it.

17
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,600
You're right.

18
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,600
I earned this, and I'm going to enjoy it.

19
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,600
As soon as I recover from my nervous breakdown.

20
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,600
What are you afraid of?

21
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Everything.

22
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
A critic was there this morning.

23
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
He probably hates my work.

24
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,600
I have to sign copies of my book for a lot of people

25
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I never met before.

26
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
My new shoes hurt my feet...

27
00:09:51,600 --> 00:10:03,600
You're going to be a great success.

28
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Are you ready?

29
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
As soon as I get these cuff links on.

30
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Let me help.

31
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Mom and Dad are already on their way down to the gallery.

32
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:25,600
There! You look very attractive.

33
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Thank you.

34
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Well, I suppose I've run out of excuses.

35
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Mm-hmm. Let's go...

36
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Oh, one minute.

37
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Before we go to the gallery,

38
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
I just want to tell you

39
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
that I never could have done this book

40
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
without your help and your love.

41
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,600
I appreciate it.

42
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Thanks.

43
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Now, no more stalling.

44
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
What is it?

45
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
There's nobody here!

46
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Of course not, Richard.

47
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Your show doesn't begin until eight thirty.

48
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Oh. Right.

49
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Richard! Welcome! Good luck tonight!

50
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Well, thanks.

51
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
This is my publisher, Harvey Carlson.

52
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
You've met my wife Marilyn...

53
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Charmed.

54
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
My mother, Ellen Stewart.

55
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Harvey Carlson.

56
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
It's good to meet you.

57
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,600
This is my father, Dr. Philip Stewart...

58
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Nice to meet you, Mr. Carlson.

59
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
My brother Robbie...

60
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Hi.

61
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Hi.

62
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
And this is my sister Susan and her husband Harry Bennett

63
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
and his daughter Michelle.

64
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
It's nice to meet you.

65
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,600
And this gentleman is my grandfather, Malcolm Stewart.

66
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Welcome, Mr. Stewart.

67
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Well, make yourselves comfortable.

68
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,600
There are hors d'oeuvres at the table, fruit punch at the bar.

69
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Help yourselves.

70
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Can I get you something, Mr. Stewart?

71
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
No, thank you.

72
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
You can feel very proud of your grandson, Mr. Stewart.

73
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
I do.

74
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,600
I'm proud of all my grandchildren, Mr. Carlson.

75
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Of course.

76
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Feel free to look around.

77
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
If you need anything, just ask.

78
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Thank you.

79
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Harvey? Harvey

80
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Yes?

81
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Did Mitchell Johnson's review come out yet?

82
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Not yet.

83
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
The newspapers don't come out till about ten o'clock.

84
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
When they come out, we'll get it.

85
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Thanks.

86
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Ready?

87
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Yes. Have the people arrived?

88
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
The guests are waiting.

89
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Tom's about to open the doors.

90
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Good luck! And stop worrying!

91
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
They're going to love it.

1
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
What's this?

2
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Read it.

3
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,600
I can't.

4
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Would you read it, Marilyn?

5
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,600
"Richard Stewart's show at the Carlson Gallery"

6
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
is a collection of photographs

7
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
from his new book entitled "Family Album, U.S.A."

8
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,600
There is power and beauty in Mr. Stewart's work,

9
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
and his book

10
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
introduces us to a remarkable new talent.

11
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Oh, Richard, it's wonderful!

12
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Congratulations!

13
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Wow! I'm overwhelmed.

14
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

15
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,600
if I may have your attention for a moment, please?

16
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,600
I hope you're all enjoying the exhibition.

17
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
I know that I am.

18
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,600
And I would like to introduce the young man

19
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
who spent the last five years

20
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
taking these remarkable pictures

21
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,600
and writing the background for Family Album, U.S.A.

22
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Mr. Richard Stewart.

23
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Hello.

24
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I want to thank all of you for coming here tonight.

25
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,600
I'd like to thank Harvey Carlson

26
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
for his faith in my project.

27
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,600
But most of all,

28
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,600
I would like to thank my family

29
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,600
for their love and support all through this adventure.

30
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Thank you.

31
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Oh, I'm glad that's over.

32
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Would you mind?

33
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
Oh, not at all.

34
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Thanks.

35
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Our pleasure.

36
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
Hope it wins a Pulitzer Prize.

37
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
I'll settle for an "A" in my photography course.

38
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Ah, Richard, Marilyn, I want you to meet John O'Neill.

39
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Oh, how do you do?

40
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Nice to meet you.

41
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,600
I've been looking forward to meeting your husband, Mrs. Stewart.

42
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,600
I'm really impressed by your show.

43
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Thank you.

44
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
In fact, I'd like your autograph.

45
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Oh, well, really...

46
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
On a contract.

47
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,600
What's this about, Harvey?

48
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Mr. O'Neill is the publisher of several magazines.

49
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Of course. I've seen you on television.

50
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Mr. O'Neill was so impressed with your work

51
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
that he wants to develop it into a magazine concept.

52
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Well, that sounds very exciting,

53
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,600
but where would I fit into the plan?

54
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
I'd like you to be the photo editor of the magazine.

55
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Oh, Richard, how exciting!

56
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
It's a wonderful opportunity, Richard.

57
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Hold on. Wait a minute, please.

58
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,600
What's the problem, Richard?

59
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,600
The problem is that I'm a photographer, not an editor.

60
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
I like what I do.

61
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
In fact, I love what I do...

62
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,600
which is going out with a camera and a roll of film

63
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
and seeing the wonder of humanity.

64
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Now, I appreciate your offer,

65
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
but I've worked so hard on Family Album, U.S.A.,

66
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,600
and I'm giving some thought to a new book on a different subject.

67
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
I'm flattered,

68
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,600
but I enjoy taking pictures, and I want to continue doing that.

69
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Thank you,

70
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,600
but I'm happy being a photographer.

71
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
I understand, Richard.

72
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Richard, I know your next book will be a success.

73
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Congratulations!

74
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Thanks.

75
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:17,600
You're a real Stewart!

76
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Thanks.
