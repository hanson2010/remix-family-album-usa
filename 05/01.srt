Episode 01 - 46 Linden Street

1
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,000
Excuse me.

2
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
My name is Richard Stewart.

3
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm a photographer.

4
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
May I take a picture of you and your little boy?

5
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,500
What's it for?

6
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,600
It's for a book.

7
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
You're writing a book?

8
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
It's a book of pictures.

9
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
I call it Family Album, U.S.A.

10
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Oh, that's a nice idea.

11
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Well, it's fine if you take our picture.

12
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
I'm Martha Vann.

13
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Thank you. I appreciate your help.

14
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm Richard. What's your name?

15
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Gerald. Gerald

16
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
How old are you, Gerald? Gerald

17
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Five.

18
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
And where do you live?

19
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
We live in California.

20
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Well, welcome to New York.

21
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
OK, just a second.

22
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I'm almost ready here.

23
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Can I help you?

24
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Oh, please.

25
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Hold Gerald's hand, please.

26
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Great!

27
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Now point to the buildings.

28
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Terrific!

29
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Give Mommy a kiss, Gerald. Gerald

30
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Nice!

31
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Thank you, Gerald.

32
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,600
And thank you, Mrs. Vann.

33
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Oh, my pleasure.

34
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
We'll be looking for your book.

35
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Thank you. Good-bye. Bye, Gerald.

36
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Thanks again.

37
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Oh, you're welcome.

38
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Hey, let me take your picture!

39
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Wonderful. Please.

40
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Are you from New York?

41
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
No, I'm from Greece.

42
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
I'm an exchange student.

43
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
When did you come here?

44
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Three months ago.

45
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Your English is very good.

46
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Thanks.

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
I studied English in school.

48
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Would you like some coffee?

49
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
No, thank you.

50
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Tell me about your book.

51
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Oh, it's not finished yet,

52
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
but I have some of the pictures.

53
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Would you like to see them?

54
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Yes. I'd like that.

55
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Here they are.

56
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Family Album, U.S.A.

57
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
It's an album of pictures of the United States:

58
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
the cities, the special places, and the people.

59
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
And these are pictures of people working:

60
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:47,600
steelworkers, bankers, police, street vendors,

61
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:55,600
ambulance drivers, doctors....

62
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Oh, this is my father. He's a doctor.

63
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,600
This is my mother.

64
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
What's her name?

65
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Ellen. Ellen

66
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,600
My younger brother, Robbie.

67
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
He goes to high school.

68
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
This is my sister Susan.

69
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,600
She works for a toy company.

70
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Here's my grandfather.

71
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
He lives in Florida.

72
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
And this is my wife Marilyn.

73
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Oh, she's very pretty.

74
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Thanks. And what about your family?

75
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
They are in Thessaloniki.

76
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,600
That's a large city in northern Greece.

77
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
But now I'm living in the Bronx.

78
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
With a Greek-American family?

79
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
No. Hispanic.

80
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Oh no! It's five thirty.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,600
Will you excuse me?

82
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
I have to meet my wife.

83
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
It was nice meeting you.

84
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
It was a pleasure meeting you, too.

85
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Thanks for your help.

86
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,600
And good luck! I've got to go.

87
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
By the way, I'm Richard.

88
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
What's your name?

89
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Alexandra. Alexandra

90
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Bye-bye, Alexandra. Thanks.

91
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Bye-bye.

92
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Richard! Richard!

93
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
You left your bag!

1
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Excuse me, officer. Can you help me?

2
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:07,700
Sure.

3
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,500
Can you tell me how to get to Linden Street in Riverdale?

4
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Richard Stewart, 46 Linden Street, Riverdale, New York.

5
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
You should take the number 1 subway.

6
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Is there a station near here?

7
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Yes. The station's that way.

8
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
You should take the number 1 train to Van Cortlandt Park.

9
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Number 1 train to Van Cortlandt Park. Thank you.

10
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Anytime. Good luck.

11
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Remember, the number 1 train. The uptown platform.

12
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Thank you.

13
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
You're welcome.

14
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Is this pink too bright for me?

15
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Mmm-hmm. It is a very bright pink.

16
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Try this. It's size eight.

17
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,500
But I wear size ten.

18
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,500
How about green? It's size ten.

19
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
Let me try it on.

20
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,500
I'm taking too much of your time.

21
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,500
It's six o'clock.

22
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Where's my husband?

23
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:23,800
Where's my husband?

24
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,500
I was expecting him here at five forty-five.

25
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Don't worry. The traffic is very heavy at this hour.

26
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,500
I know. But we're going to be late for dinner.

27
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,500
I'll take this green sweater.

28
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
I like the color on me, don't you?

29
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
I think it looks terrific on you.

30
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:44,500
I'm sorry I'm so late.

31
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
I had a really bad day.

32
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,500
It's ten after six. We're late.

33
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
Robbie's cooking tonight, and dinner's at six thirty.

34
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
I know. I know. I'm really sorry.

35
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,500
I left my bag of film on the ferry.

36
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
I went back for it, but the ferry was gone.

37
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
I lost a whole day's work.

38
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,500
I'll call the Staten Island Ferry lost-and-found office.

39
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
I didn't think of that. Thanks.

40
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Hello.

41
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Yes. The number, please,

42
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
of the Staten Island Ferry lost-and-found office. Staten

43
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:25,500
Five five five...zero eight zero eight. 555-

44
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Thank you.

45
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
I really appreciate it, Marilyn.

46
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
I really appreciate it, Marilyn.

47
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Hello.

48
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Did anyone find a camera bag this afternoon,

49
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,500
a small canvas bag,

50
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,500
on the J. F. Kennedy Ferry?...No?

51
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Maybe someone will find it.

52
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,500
The name is Stewart, Richard Stewart.

53
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,500
And the telephone number is five five five...

54
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
three oh nine oh. Thank you.

55
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Sorry, Richard. They don't have it.

56
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Thanks, anyway.

57
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,500
There was a girl on the ferry.

58
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Now maybe...

59
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Tell me about it on the way home.

1
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,500
And give her a teaspoon of the medicine after every meal.

2
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

3
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,500
You're welcome. Good-bye.

4
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:27,500
How are you?

5
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
I'm tired and hungry.

6
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Well, Marilyn and Richard called.

7
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
They'll be here soon, and then we'll eat.

8
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,500
All right. Is...is Susan coming?

9
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Well, she'll be here later.

10
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
She has to work late tonight.

11
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
And what's Robbie cooking for dinner? Robbie

12
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,500
It's a surprise.

13
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,500
I hope it's pasta.

14
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Robbie, the dinner was terrific. Robbie

15
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Yes, it was delicious.

16
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,500
What's for dessert?

17
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Oh, I forgot dessert.

18
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Robbie! Robbie

19
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Don't worry.

20
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
We've got lots of ice cream.

21
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Oh, I'd love some ice cream.

22
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Well, there's chocolate and coffee and a little vanilla.

23
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
I'll have vanilla.

24
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Is that all right with everyone?

25
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
I'll have chocolate.

26
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Me, too.

27
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Uh, one scoop of coffee

28
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
and one scoop of chocolate for me.

29
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,500
Robbie, will you help me serve? Robbie

30
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:43,500
I keep thinking about that bag of film. Eight rolls.

31
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,500
A whole day's work.

32
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
And good stuff, too.

33
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Don't worry, Richard.

34
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Somenoe will find it.

35
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,500
I'll get it. Hello.

36
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Hello.

37
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Does Richard Stewart live here? Richard Stewart

38
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
I'm Robbie...Robbie Stewart.

40
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,500
I'm Alexandra Pappas.

41
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
How do you do?

42
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Your brother left his bag of film on the ferryboat.

43
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,500
I found it.

44
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
I'm really glad to see you.

45
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,500
I mean...my brother'll be really glad to see you!

46
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Robbie! Who is it? Robbie

47
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,500
It's Richard's film! Richard

48
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,500
I mean, Alexandra Pappas.

49
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Come in, please.

50
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Alexandra! Alexandra

51
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
Hello, Richard. I found your bag!

52
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

53
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Um...Alexandra, let me introduce you.

54
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
This is my wife Marilyn.

55
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Richard showed me your photo. Richard

56
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
How do you do?

57
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Oh yes.

58
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
Richard told us all about you. Richard

59
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
It's nice to meet you.

60
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
And this is my mother, Ellen Stewart.

61
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,500
How do you do?

62
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
And my father, Dr. Philip Stewart.

63
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Nice to meet you, Alexandra.

64
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
And...ah...you met Robbie.

65
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Yes. And you must be Susan. Hi.

66
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Hi. Welcome.

67
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
I'm so glad you found the bag

68
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
and took the time and trouble to return it.

69
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Oh, it was no trouble.

70
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
I just took the wrong train.

71
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Would you like something to eat?

72
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Thank you, no.

73
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
I'm late for dinner at my house.

74
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
I really have to go.

75
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Would you like to call home?

76
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
I'd appreciate that.

77
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Please, use the phone.

78
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
Thanks. Excuse me.

79
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,500
Alexandra's a high-school exchange student from Greece. Alexandra

80
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Where does she live?

81
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
With a family in the Bronx.

82
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Oh, that's not too far from here!

83
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Take it easy, Robbie.

84
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Thank you.

85
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
I can only stay a few minutes.

86
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Have some iced tea.

87
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Thanks, Mrs. Stewart.

88
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Please sit down, Alexandra.

89
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:05,500
So, you're an exchange student.

90
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,500
Where do you go to school?

91
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,500
At the Bronx High School of Science.

92
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Oh, that's a very good school.

93
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
What are your favorite subjects?

94
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Biology and mathematics.

95
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Richard tells me you're a doctor. Richard

96
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
Yes, a pediatrician.

97
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
And what does your father do?

98
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,500
He's a lawyer, in Thessaloniki.

99
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Would you like some pasta?

100
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
I made it myself.

101
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
It might be a little cold.

102
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,500
Thanks, no. I do have to go.

103
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
It was nice meeting you all.

104
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Well, maybe you'll come for lunch some Sunday,

105
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
so we can really thank you

106
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
for bringing Richard's bag back.

107
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
Maybe.

108
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
You're welcome anytime.

109
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Good-bye.

110
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:52,500
Can I drive you home?

111
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,500
No, thanks.

112
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
The train is just up the street.

113
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
It won't take me long at all.

114
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Well, you really saved the day for me, Alexandra.

115
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Bye.

116
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Bye-bye.

117
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,500
Good night.

118
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:13,500
She's a smart young lady, and very nice.

119
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Very! Hey, she forgot her bag!

120
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,500
I guess we'll be seeing Alexandra again.

121
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Right, Robbie?
