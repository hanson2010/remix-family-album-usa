Episode 08 - You're Going to Be Fine

1
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Molly, I need your special talent for handling special matters.

2
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Like what special matters?

3
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Well, I have a scheduling problem.

4
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Yes?

5
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,600
I have three tonsillectomies set for Friday with Dr. Earl.

6
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Yes?

7
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,600
I need to fit a fourth operation into his schedule.

8
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,600
And... I know you can do it.

9
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Who's the patient?

10
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Carl Herrera.

11
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
The boy has infected tonsils,

12
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
and we should remove them as soon as possible.

13
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Well, I'll try to arrange the schedule, Dr. Stewart.

14
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
But it's not going to be easy.

15
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,600
I know you'll be able to take care of it.

16
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Well, Mrs. Herrera,

17
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Carl will be perfectly fine after we remove his tonsils.

18
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Thank you for your reassurance, Dr. Stewart.

19
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,600
He's had so many colds and sore throats recently.

20
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Well, it's a very easy operation, Carl.

21
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
You won't feel a thing.

22
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
But when do they do it?

23
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
This Friday.

24
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
But Saturday's my birthday.

25
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Well, we could reschedule the operation, Mrs. Herrera,

26
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
but I don't want to put it off too long.

27
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
No, I think it's important to do it now.

28
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,600
We can have a birthday party for you, Carl,

29
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
When you come out of the hospital.

30
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
But it won't be on my birthday.

31
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
But your health is more important, Carl. Believe me.

32
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
I don't want my tonsils out.

33
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Nurse Baker, would you come in, please?

34
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Hello, Mrs. Herrera. Hi, Carl, how you doing?

35
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,600
I don't want my tonsils out.

36
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Come with me, Carl.

37
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
You and I will talk this over.

38
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:50,600
She has a special way with kids.

39
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
She sure does.

40
00:03:51,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Carl, does your throat hurt?

41
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Yes.

42
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
OK. Do you want to get better?

43
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Yes.

44
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
OK. We want you to get better, too.

45
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
You'll have your tonsils out tomorrow,

46
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,600
and you won't get so many colds anymore.

47
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
But if I have my tonsils out tomorrow,

48
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
I'll miss my birthday party on Saturday.

49
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
I know.

50
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
It's a problem, isn't it?

51
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Let me try to work something out.

52
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
What?

53
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
I have to think about it.

54
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
You're fooling me.

55
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Oh, I'm not, Carl.

56
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Give me a chance to think about it,

57
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
and I'll come up with something.

58
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
A surprise?

59
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Maybe.

60
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
But you just put on your pajamas and robe,

61
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
and I'll think of a surprise.

62
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Will it hurt?

63
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
No.

64
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
There are other boys and girls here,

65
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
and they're having their tonsils out.

66
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
You'll meet them.

67
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
I don't want to.

68
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Change your clothes, Carl.

69
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Everything will be just fine.

1
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,600
OK.

2
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Do you know how to play charades?

3
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Frank, you've never played charades?

4
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Nope.

5
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Carl, you're sure you've never played?

6
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,600
OK, Betty, Tim, and Frank.

7
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
We're going to play charades.

8
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Frank, you can learn as we go.

9
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
And, Carl, you join in at any time.

10
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,600
OK, let me think.

11
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,600
OK, I've got one.

12
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:48,600
All right.

13
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,600
A movie!

14
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
A movie!

15
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Right.

16
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
A movie.

17
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
OK.

18
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Six words.

19
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
It has six words.

20
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
That's easy.

21
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
I can play.

22
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Good. OK.

23
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
We've got a movie.

24
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
The title...

25
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Six words.

26
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Right.

27
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
First word ...

28
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Sounds like.

29
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Sounds like ...

30
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
You got that part right.

31
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Yes.

32
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Sounds like ...

33
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Sounds like what?

34
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Sounds like no.

35
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Absolutely right, Frank.

36
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Sounds like no.

37
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
OK.

38
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
We've got a movie.

39
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Six words.

40
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
The first word sounds like no.

41
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Row. Row.

42
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Go. Go

43
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Nope.

44
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Show.

45
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
That's it - show.

46
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
No... OK...

47
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Snow.

48
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Absolutely right, Betty.

49
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Sounds like no - snow.

50
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
OK, a movie. Six words.

51
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
The first word is snow.

52
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
This is fun.

53
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Oh, OK.

54
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,600
The fifth word.

55
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Right, fifth word.

56
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Seven?

57
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Absolutely right.

58
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Very good.

59
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
The fifth word is seven.

60
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
OK, we've got a movie.

61
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
The first word is snow.

62
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Fifth word, seven.

63
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
I got it!

64
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
I got it!

65
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

66
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,600
I got it.

67
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
I got it.

68
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Frank, you got it.

69
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Betty, you had it, but you didn't say it.

70
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
I knew it.

71
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Carl, now you know charades.

72
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Why don't you join us?

73
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
I don't like charades.

74
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
It's for babies.

75
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Oh, I like it.

76
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Well, they're babies.

77
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
You're a sore loser.

78
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Yeah.

79
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
No arguing.

80
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Save your voices.

81
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Between now and tomorrow

82
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
you're all going to have your tonsils out.

83
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
And you won't be able to speak for a while.

84
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
So save your voices till then.

85
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Hi, gang. Hi, everybody.

86
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Well, what's going on?

87
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I sure I am glad to see you, Dr. Stewart.

88
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
This is a rough group.

89
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,600
I didn't want to play charades,

90
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
so they're angry at me.

91
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Why don't you want to play?

92
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Because I don't want to be here.

93
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I don't want my tonsils out.

94
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Why not?

95
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Because my birthday is tomorrow.

96
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
My mother promised me a birthday party with a clown.

97
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
But you can have one when you go home, Carl.

98
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,600
But my birthday is tomorrow.

99
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
I'm sorry, Carl.

100
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Carl, you'll have your party when you go home,

101
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
But it won't be on my birthday!

102
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,600
And you promised me a surprise.

1
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,600
It hurts, doesn't it?

2
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,600
You'll feel better tomorrow, Betty, believe me.

3
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Only one day, and it won't hurt as much.

4
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Do you feel like eating?

5
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Having some dinner?

6
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Oh, don't look so sad.

7
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Let me tell you about your dinner.

8
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
It's ice cream.

9
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Ice cream.

10
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
All kinds of flavors.

11
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Chocolate.

12
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Strawberry?

13
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Vanilla?

14
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Vanilla, too?

15
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,600
I see you're feeling better already, Betty.

16
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
So you will have dinner?

17
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,600
OK, honey, we'll see to it

18
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,600
that you have strawberry and vanilla ice cream.

19
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Just rest now.

20
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
You need some rest to help you get better quickly.

21
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Hi, Frank.

22
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,600
How you doing?

23
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Oh, come on now.

24
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
You're a big boy.

25
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
It doesn't hurt that much, does it?

26
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Oh, I'm sorry it hurts so much,

27
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
and you won't be able to have dinner.

28
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
You're just going to have to have ice cream.

29
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Yes, ice cream.

30
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Lots of flavors.

31
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Want to hear them?

32
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Chocolate?

33
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Then chocolate it is.

34
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
One scoop or two?

35
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Three scoops?

36
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Then three it will be.

37
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:15,600
You want three scoops also?

38
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Chocolate, too?

39
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Well, I see you're feeling better.

40
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Well, at least you're acting like you feel better.

41
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Three scoops of chocolate ice cream for Tim coming up.

42
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Hi, Carl.

43
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
How you doing?

44
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,600
I know it hurts.

45
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
But it'll be better tomorrow.

46
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
In the meantime, what would you like?

47
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Surprise.

48
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
A surprise?

49
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,600
I promised you a surprise, didn't I?

50
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
And it wasn't just ice cream, was it?

51
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Your birthday is tomorrow, isn't it?

52
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Well, maybe, just maybe,

53
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
there will be a surprise.

54
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,600
But first you have to smile.

55
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,600
I just want to see one smile from you.

56
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,600
No smile, no surprise.

57
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,600
That's the deal.

58
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
No smile, no surprise.

59
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
If you want a surprise,

60
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
then you've got to smile first.

61
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:48,600
How are you all doing?

62
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Well, I'm glad you're feeling better

63
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,600
because we have a little surprise for you today.

64
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
It's Carl's birthday,

65
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,600
and we have Popo the Clown to entertain you.

66
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
And here he is - Popo the Clown.

67
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Happy birthday, Carl.
Happy birthday.

68
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
All right, everybody.

69
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
OK, Carl.

70
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
It's your birthday.

71
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
What's your wish?

72
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
What would you like?

73
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Hmm?

74
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,600
You want to play charades?
