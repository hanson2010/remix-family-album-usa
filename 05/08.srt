Episode 08 - You're Going to Be Fine

1
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Molly, I need your special talent for handling special matters. Molly

2
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Like what special matters?

3
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Well, I have a scheduling problem.

4
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Yes?

5
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,600
I have three tonsillectomies set for Friday with Dr. Earl.

6
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Yes?

7
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,600
I need to fit a fourth operation into his schedule.

8
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,600
And ... I know you can do it.

9
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Who's the patient?

10
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Carl Herrera. Carl Herrera

11
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
The boy has infected tonsils,

12
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
and we should remove them as soon as possible.

13
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Well, I'll try to arrange the schedule, Dr. Stewart.

14
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
But it's not going to be easy.

15
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,600
I know you'll be able to take care of it.

16
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Well, Mrs. Herrera,

17
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Carl will be perfectly fine after we remove his tonsils.

18
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Thank you for your reassurance, Dr. Stewart.

19
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,600
He's had so many colds and sore throats recently.

20
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Well, it's a very easy operation, Carl.

21
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
You won't feel a thing.

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
But when do they do it?

23
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
This Friday.

24
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
But Saturday's my birthday.

25
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Well, we could reschedule the operation, Mrs. Herrera,

26
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
but I don't want to put it off too long.

27
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
No, I think it's important to do it now.

28
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,600
We can have a birthday party for you, Carl,

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
When you come out of the hospital.

30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
But it won't be on my birthday.

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,600
But your health is more important, Carl. Believe me.

32
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
I don't want my tonsils out.

33
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Nurse Baker, would you come in, please? Baker

34
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Hello, Mrs. Herrera. Hi, Carl, how you doing?

35
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
I don't want my tonsils out.

36
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Come with me, Carl.

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
You and I will talk this over.

38
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:34,600
She has a special way with kids.

39
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
She sure does.

40
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Carl, does your throat hurt? Carl

41
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Yes.

42
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
OK. Do you want to get better?

43
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Yes.

44
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
OK. We want you to get better, too.

45
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
You'll have your tonsils out tomorrow,

46
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,600
and you won't get so many colds anymore.

47
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
But if I have my tonsils out tomorrow,

48
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
I'll miss my birthday party on Saturday.

49
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
I know.

50
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
It's a problem, isn't it?

51
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Let me try to work something out.

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,600
What?

53
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
I have to think about it.

54
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
You're fooling me.

55
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Oh, I'm not, Carl.

56
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Give me a chance to think about it,

57
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
and I'll come up with something.

58
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
A surprise?

59
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Maybe.

60
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
But you just put on your pajamas and robe,

61
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
and I'll think of a surprise.

62
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Will it hurt?

63
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
No.

64
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
There are other boys and girls here,

65
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
and they're having their tonsils out.

66
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
You'll meet them.

67
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
I don't want to.

68
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Change your clothes, Carl.

69
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Everything will be just fine.

1
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,100
OK.

2
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,100
Do you know how to play charades?

3
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,100
Frank, you've never played charades? Frank

4
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Nope.

5
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Carl, you're sure you've never played? Carl

6
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:20,100
OK, Betty, Tim, and Frank.

7
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
We're going to play charades.

8
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Frank, you can learn as we go. Frank

9
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
And, Carl, you join in at any time.

10
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,100
OK, let me think.

11
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,100
OK, I've got one.

12
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:44,100
All right.

13
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,100
A movie!

14
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
A movie!

15
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
Right.

16
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,100
A movie.

17
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
OK.

18
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,100
Six words.

19
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,100
It has six words.

20
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
That's easy.

21
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
I can play.

22
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,100
Good. OK.

23
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,100
We've got a movie.

24
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
The title ...

25
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Six words.

26
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,100
Right.

27
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
First word ...

28
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,100
Sounds like.

29
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Sounds like ...

30
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,100
You got that part right.

31
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Yes.

32
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Sounds like ...

33
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,100
Sounds like what?

34
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
Sounds like no.

35
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Absolutely right, Frank.

36
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
Sounds like no.

37
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
OK.

38
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
We've got a movie.

39
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Six words.

40
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
The first word sounds like no.

41
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Row. Row. Row

42
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
Go. Go

43
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Nope.

44
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,100
Show. Show

45
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
That's it--show.

46
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
No ... OK ...

47
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:57,100
Snow.

48
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Absolutely right, Betty.

49
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Sounds like no -- snow.

50
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,100
OK, a movie. Six words.

51
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,100
The first word is snow.

52
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
This is fun.

53
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
Oh, OK.

54
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,100
The fifth word.

55
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Right, fifth word.

56
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Seven?

57
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,100
Absolutely right.

58
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Very good.

59
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,100
The fifth word is seven.

60
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100
OK, we've got a movie.

61
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,100
The first word is snow.

62
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,100
Fifth word, seven.

63
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,100
I got it!

64
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
I got it!

65
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,100
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs

66
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:40,100
I got it.

67
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
I got it.

68
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Frank, you got it. Frank

69
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
Betty, you had it, but you didn't say it. Betty

70
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
I knew it.

71
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Carl, now you know charades. Carl

72
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Why don't you join us?

73
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
I don't like charades.

74
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,100
It's for babies.

75
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
Oh, I like it.

76
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,100
Well, they're babies.

77
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,100
You're a sore loser.

78
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Yeah.

79
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
No arguing.

80
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,100
Save your voices.

81
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Between now and tomorrow

82
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
you're all going to have your tonsils out.

83
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
And you won't be able to speak for a while.

84
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,100
So save your voices till then.

85
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,100
Hi, gang. Hi, everybody.

86
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,100
Well, what's going on?

87
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
I sure I am glad to see you, Dr. Stewart.

88
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,100
This is a rough group.

89
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,100
I didn't want to play charades,

90
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,100
so they're angry at me.

91
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,100
Why don't you want to play?

92
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Because I don't want to be here.

93
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,100
I don't want my tonsils out.

94
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
Why not?

95
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Because my birthday is tomorrow.

96
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,100
My mother promised me a birthday party with a clown.

97
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,100
But you can have one when you go home, Carl.

98
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,100
But my birthday is tomorrow.

99
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
I'm sorry, Carl.

100
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,100
Carl, you'll have your party when you go home, Carl

101
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,100
But it won't be on my birthday!

102
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,100
And you promised me a surprise.

1
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,100
It hurts, doesn't it?

2
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,100
You'll feel better tomorrow, Betty, believe me.

3
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,100
Only one day, and it won't hurt as much.

4
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,100
Do you feel like eating?

5
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
Having some dinner?

6
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,100
Oh, don't look so sad.

7
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
Let me tell you about your dinner.

8
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
It's ice cream.

9
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,100
Ice cream.

10
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,100
All kinds of flavors.

11
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
Chocolate.

12
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,100
Strawberry?

13
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,100
Vanilla?

14
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Vanilla, too?

15
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,100
I see you're feeling better already, Betty.

16
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,100
So you will have dinner?

17
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,100
OK, honey, we'll see to it

18
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,100
that you have strawberry and vanilla ice cream.

19
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Just rest now.

20
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
You need some rest to help you get better quickly.

21
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:28,100
Hi, Frank.

22
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,100
How you doing?

23
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,100
Oh, come on now.

24
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
You're a big boy.

25
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
It doesn't hurt that much, does it?

26
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,100
Oh, I'm sorry it hurts so much,

27
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,100
and you won't be able to have dinner.

28
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100
You're just going to have to have ice cream.

29
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,100
Yes, ice cream.

30
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Lots of flavors.

31
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,100
Want to hear them?

32
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Chocolate?

33
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,100
Then chocolate it is.

34
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
One scoop or two?

35
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Three scoops?

36
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
Then three it will be.

37
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:13,100
You want three scoops also?

38
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,100
Chocolate, too?

39
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,100
Well, I see you're feeling better.

40
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:22,100
Well, at least you're acting like you feel better.

41
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,100
Three scoops of chocolate ice cream for Tim coming up.

42
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:34,100
Hi, Carl.

43
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,100
How you doing?

44
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,100
I know it hurts.

45
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,100
But it'll be better tomorrow.

46
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
In the meantime, what would you like?

47
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Surprise.

48
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
A surprise?

49
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,100
I promised you a surprise, didn't I?

50
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,100
And it wasn't just ice cream, was it?

51
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,100
Your birthday is tomorrow, isn't it?

52
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Well, maybe, just maybe,

53
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
there will be a surprise.

54
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,100
But first you have to smile.

55
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,100
I just want to see one smile from you.

56
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,100
No smile, no surprise.

57
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,100
That's the deal.

58
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,100
No smile, no surprise.

59
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,100
If you want a surprise,

60
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
then you've got to smile first.

61
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:46,100
How are you all doing?

62
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
Well, I'm glad you're feeling better

63
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,100
because we have a little surprise for you today.

64
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
It's Carl's birthday,

65
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,100
and we have Popo the Clown to entertain you.

66
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,100
And here he is--Popo the Clown.

67
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Happy birthday, Carl.
Happy birthday.

68
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
All right, everybody.

69
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
OK, Carl.

70
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,100
It's your birthday.

71
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,100
What 's your wish?

72
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,100
What would you like?

73
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
Hmm?

74
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,100
You want to play charades?
