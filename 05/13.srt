Episode 13 - A Real Stewart

1
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,600
There's nothing more joyous than the arrival of a new baby.

2
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
I am so excited. Mother!

3
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Just imagine--Marilyn and Richard must be thrilled!

4
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Oh, a new baby!

5
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Max... Max... Max.

6
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Oh, it's a sweet-sounding name for a sweet little boy.

7
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,600
My first grandchild.

8
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
And my first nephew.

9
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Isn't he just adorable?

10
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
He looks a lot like you, Mom. He does.

11
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Do you think so?

12
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Well, I guess. He does look a lot like Richard,

13
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
and I guess he looks a lot like me.

14
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Oh, he's got Richard's eyes, though.

15
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
I really want Harry and Michelle to see Max.

16
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,600
When are they coming?

17
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Tomorrow. Harry has an account to work on today.

18
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Yes, he does have Richard's eyes. Big blue eyes.

19
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,600
The baby even looks at you like Richard does.

20
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Well, children usually resemble their parents.

21
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
It's true.

22
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Michelle is a lot like Harry in so many ways.

23
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,600
And she's shy with new people, just like he is.

24
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,600
You really like Michelle, don't you?

25
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Yes. I'm very fond of her.

26
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
And Harry, too?

27
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Well...

28
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Uh, it's four-thirty. Oh my!

29
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Marilyn and Richard will be home from the hospital any minute,

30
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
and we must prepare this room.

31
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Where will we put all the presents?

32
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Well, let's take everything to the living room.

33
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Marilyn and Richard and the baby need the space.

34
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
It's crowded in here.

35
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,600
The welcome sign is up:

36
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
"Welcome home, Max."

37
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Isn't it exciting, Grandpa?

38
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Your first great-grandchild.

39
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Yes. Yes, sir.

40
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
A great-grandchild. A great-grandson.

41
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Another generation to carry on the Stewart name.

42
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
I love you, Grandpa.

43
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,600
You make me feel so proud to be part of our family.

44
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
One day, you'll have your own family,

45
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
and I'll be proud to be part of it.

46
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Now you understand my feelings, Susan.

47
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm Grandpa's daughter-in-law, but I feel like a Stewart.

48
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
He's always made me feel like his own daughter.

49
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,600
that's because you're so much like us. Wonderful!

50
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Mom, got it.

51
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,600
This will make a nice gift for Marilyn and Richard.

52
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,600
They can keep a record of all of the important dates

53
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
and information about Max's life here.

54
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Let's see.

55
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Name: Max Stewart.

56
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Does he have a middle name?

57
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,600
No, just Max. I like that.

58
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
No, just Max. I like that.

59
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
No middle name. No middle initial.

60
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Like me. I'm Malcolm Stewart.

61
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Just Malcolm Stewart.

62
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,600
And Max has your initials, Grandpa: M.S. Max

63
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Uh, it must mean something.

64
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Weight: eight pounds six ounces.

65
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Eight-six. Big boy!

66
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
All the Stewart men were big.

67
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Well, Robbie was eight pounds two ounces,

68
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
and Richard was eight pounds three.

69
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
And me?

70
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Eight pounds six.

71
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,600
You were big, just like Max.

72
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Eight pounds six, just like me.

73
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,600
That's nice. Length. Length?

74
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Richard says Max is twenty-one inches long.

75
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Twenty-one inches.

76
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Is that tall or average or what?

77
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Tall. All the Stewart men are tall.

78
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Well, Grandpa, you're about five-nine or five-ten.

79
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
I wouldn't call that tall.

80
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,600
I take after my mother's family.

81
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
I take after my mother's family.

82
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,600
They were... they were... they were average.

83
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Mother: Marilyn. Father: Richard.

84
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,600
And lots of pages for Richard's photos of Max.

85
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Speaking of mother and of father

86
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,600
and speaking of Max, I hear the car.

87
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
They're here!

88
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Oh! Oh, quickly! Go, go, go!

89
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Let's see. Oh, welcome home.

90
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Oh, let her in.

91
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Wait with your pictures for a second.

92
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Come on, darlings.

93
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Sweetheart, sit down right here.

94
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Oh, he's so cute! Oh, Marilyn!

95
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Max looks just like Grandpa.

96
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
A real Stewart.

97
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,600
I'm so happy to be home with my family and with Max.

1
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
It's almost ten o'clock.

2
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,600
I've got to go. Tomorrow is Monday,

3
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
and work begins at eight in the morning for me.

4
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Oh, I'm so happy that Max is home.

5
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
He's the sweetest little thing.

6
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
I'll drive you to the station, dear.

7
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,600
You can catch the ten-twenty train to Grand Central Station.

8
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I'll drive Susan, dear.

9
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Thank you, Philip.

10
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Then Grandpa, Robbie,

11
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
and I can finish wrapping all these gifts.

12
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,600
It's so good to have you home again...

13
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,600
and to see Max asleep in his bassinet at home with us.

14
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,600
To be with our family and all that Stewart TLC.

15
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:29,600
TLC - tender loving care.

16
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,600
That's our motto.

17
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Did you see the washcloth

18
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,600
and the towels with the teddy bears on them?

19
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Alexandra and the Molinas sent them for Max.

20
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,600
It was so kind of them.

21
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Now Max has come into everyone's life.

22
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
The house is so alive with him here.

23
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,600
The welcome sign over the door.

24
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,600
The boxes of presents.

25
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
The M-A-X over his bassinet.

26
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Robbie put that there.

27
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Susan's teddy bear.

28
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,600
So cuddly. The beautiful crib from Mom and Dad.

29
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Oh, and Grandpa's baseball glove.

30
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,600
You know, it hung over my crib, too.

31
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,600
And it hung over Robbie's crib.

32
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Part of Grandpa's magic?

33
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Oh, that's not all.

34
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
It hung over Susan's crib.

35
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
The same baseball glove?

36
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,600
That's right. Grandpa hangs it there for good luck.

37
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
He says it always brought him good luck on the baseball team.

38
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,600
He believes it'll bring good luck to all the Stewart babies.

39
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
And then he takes it back

40
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
when Max is ready to use it?

41
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Yes,

42
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
and replaces it with a new glove

43
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
so the old one will be ready

44
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
for a new member of the Stewart family.

45
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Grandpa really loves his family, doesn't he?

46
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,600
So do I.

47
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,600
And so do I.

48
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:11,600
And so does Max.

49
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,600
After he eats!

1
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Thanks, Michelle.

2
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
I hope you like it.

3
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Isn't this baby outfit adorable?

4
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,600
With his name on it - "Max".

5
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Thanks so much, Harry and Michelle.

6
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
We really appreciate it.

7
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
I'm glad you like it.

8
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
Michelle picked it out.

9
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Yes, I told Daddy to pick blue ones.

10
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Blue is for boys, and pink is for girls.

11
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
And Max is some boy.

12
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,600
He's a real Stewart.

13
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Right.

14
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,600
That was so thoughtful of you, Michelle.

15
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Especially to pick it out in blue.

16
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Would you like to see baby Max, Michelle?

17
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Could she? Could we?

18
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Could I?

19
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Take them upstairs, Susan.

20
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Harry and Michelle can watch Max sleeping.

21
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Let's go.

22
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
Come on, Michelle.

23
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Before Max wakes up.

24
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Will you please take this upstairs, Susan?

25
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Uh-huh.

26
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Thank you.

27
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:32,600
Michelle is very grown up for a ten-year-old, huh?

28
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,600
She's smart and sensitive for her age.

29
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Growing up without a mother is difficult.

30
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
You mature quickly.

31
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Susan's like a mother to Michelle.

32
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,600
They have a good relationship.

33
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Do you think Susan and Harry will get married?

34
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Yeah. You can count on it.

35
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,600
I think so. Yes. They get along so well.

36
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
I like him. He's good for Susan.

37
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,600
He's a little quiet.

38
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,600
It's hard to do anything but listen in this family.

39
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,600
How can anybody get a word in around here?

40
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
You're right, Ellen.

41
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Oh, really?

42
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
It's the way it should be.

43
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
The Stewarts are the Stewarts!

44
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
They always were,

45
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
and they always will be.

46
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Right!

47
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
They've always got an opinion.

48
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Always got something to say.

49
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,600
And now there's Max Stewart.

50
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,600
and if he talks as loudly as he cries,

51
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
we're all in for trouble.

52
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
He's quiet now.

53
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Mmm-hmm. That's because he's sleeping.

54
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:55,600
He's really cute.

55
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,600
It's not necessary to whisper, Harry.

56
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
A baby gets used to voices.

57
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
I remember now.

58
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
We always whispered when Michelle was born.

59
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,600
And I didn't sleep well, Daddy told me.

60
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
I never slept.

61
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
And when I did,

62
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
I woke up when I heard someone speak.

63
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
I bet you were cute.

64
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
She sure was.

65
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Not as cute as Max.

66
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
He's like a little doll.

67
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Oh, good.

68
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Now I can help diaper him.

69
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Let's get Marilyn.

70
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,600
What do you do when he cries like that?

71
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
You pick him up.

72
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,600
He's so little... so new.

73
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Let's call Marilyn.

74
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Time for a feeding and time for a diapering.

75
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600
You're a real Stewart.
