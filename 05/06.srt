Episode 06 - Thanksgiving

1
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,600
OK, Philip. This is your third cup of coffee.

2
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,600
We should get to work,

3
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
or we won't be finished by dinnertime.

4
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,600
I guess we must.

5
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
We must.

6
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:15,600
OK. The beginning of my famous Thanksgiving apple pie.

7
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,600
One apple. Two apples. Three apples. Four apples.

8
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Come on, Philip!

9
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Get busy with your famous apple pie.

10
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
There's much more to be done.

11
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Now, the ingredients.

12
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,600
What goes into my apple pie besides apples?

13
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Ah, yes. Flour, sugar, butter.

14
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Butter, nice and cold and hard.

15
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
OK, here are the walnuts.

16
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Last but not least,

17
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,600
the reason my apple pie is famous--cinnamon.

18
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Cinnamon ...

19
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Ellen, where's the cinnamon? Ellen

20
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
If there is any cinnamon,

21
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
it's in the cabinet with the salt and pepper.

22
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Salt, pepper, dill weed, garlic powder, cinnamon. Ellen?

23
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Yes, Philip.

24
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Is it possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon?

25
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Yes, it is possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon.

26
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Well, how can I make my famous apple pie without cinnamon?

27
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Good morning.

28
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Oh, hi, Robbie. Good morning.

29
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Good morning. Robbie.

30
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Can you do me a favor?

31
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Sure, Dad. What?

32
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Remember my apple pie on Thanksgiving?

33
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,600
What do you love about it?

34
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
The apples?

35
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
No. The sssss...

36
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Right. We don't have any cinnamon.

37
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
I'll go down to Henry's grocery. He's always open.

38
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
I'll get some for you.

39
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
That's my boy!

40
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Oh, put your heavy jacket on, Robbie.

41
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
It's cold outside.

42
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Alexandra might call. Alexandra

43
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Tell her I'll call her right back.

44
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
OK.

45
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Thanks, Son.

46
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Uh, why does he always have to slam the door?

47
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Hello.... Hello, Alexandra. How are you? ... Fine.

48
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Robbie just went to the store. Robbie

49
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
He'll be back soon.

50
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
He said he'll call you.

51
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,600
... Oh, oh, I see.... Oh ... certainly.

52
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Well, do you have the phone number there?

53
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,600
... Oh ... I see.... Please, I know he wants to talk to you....

54
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Thank you,

55
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,600
and happy Thanksgiving to you and your family, too.

56
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Try to come by later for dessert.... Bye.

57
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,600
That was Alexandra.

58
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
She and the Molinas

59
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
are going to spend Thanksgiving with their cousins.

60
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
She doesn't have the phone number.

61
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Oh, Robbie will be disappointed.

62
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
He'll be grouchy.

63
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Maybe she'll call back. She promised.

64
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Here's your cinnamon, Pop.

65
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:54,600
It was a dollar and sixty cents.

66
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,600
You forgot to ask me for the change.

67
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Or did you forget to give it to me?

68
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Thanks, Son.

69
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Alexandra called. Alexandra

70
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
I'll call her back.

71
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
She said she'll call you later.

72
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
She's not at home.

73
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:33,600
You should have your breakfast, Son.

74
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Make you feel better.

75
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Protein, vitamins.

76
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
She said she'll call back?

77
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Yes, she did.

78
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Good morning, everyone!

79
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Happy Turkey Day!

80
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,600
What's wrong?

81
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

82
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,600
What's gotten into him?

83
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
He missed a phone call.

84
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
From ...?

85
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Yes, Alexandra.

86
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:06,600
It's nice to see young love.... Oh, to be young again!

87
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Where's the coffee?

1
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,100
I love parades.

2
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,100
The Thanksgiving Day parade is always such great fun.

3
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,100
Look at that Superman balloon!

4
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:52,100
Wowee! Just floating along high above Central Park West.

5
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,100
Don't you just love it?

6
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,100
Oh, and the bands and the music.

7
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
John Philip Sousa. John Philip Soussa

8
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
I love his music.

9
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:07,100
Da dada da da dada da da da da da da dada.

10
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Oh, look at that float, Robbie.

11
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Look at those funny-looking clowns.

12
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
It's for kids.

13
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Maybe so, but parades always make me feel like a kid.

14
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Remember when you and your dad and I

15
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,100
went to the Thanksgiving Day parade?

16
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,100
You were four or five years old, I think.

17
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:39,100
Hello, hello.... Oh, hi, Susan.

18
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,100
How are you?... Here's Mom.

19
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,100
Hello, Susan.

20
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Yes, he missed a phone call from Alexandra.

21
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Yes, I know, but he'll get over it.

22
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,100
Good. Then you'll be here about five?

23
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Oh, fine.

24
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,100
I look forward to seeing you and Harry and Michelle.

25
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
Drive carefully.

26
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Good-bye.

27
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,100
Taste Ellen's turkey dressing.

28
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,100
It's delicious.

29
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
I'm not surprised.

30
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,100
It's Grandma's recipe.

31
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
It's my favorite part of the meal.

32
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,100
What about my famous apple pie?

33
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Dad, your apple pie is my favorite dessert.

34
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,100
How's the parade?

35
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
OK.

36
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Mom! Is it for me?

37
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,100
No, Robbie.

38
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Who was it?

39
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Wrong number.

40
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Philip, would you join me in the kitchen, please? Philip

41
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
It's getting late.

42
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,100
We have vegetables to prepare.

43
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,100
Can I help with anything?

44
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
No, honey.

45
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
You just relax with Grandpa.

46
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
I'll get you to help serve later.

47
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Ellen reminds me so much of Grandma. Ellen

48
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
What time does the Michigan football game come on? Michigan

49
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,100
Four.

50
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,100
Philip! Philip

51
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,100
I'll be back to see the game.

52
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Grandpa, when did Dad graduate from Michigan?

53
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
Let me think.

54
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,100
He graduated from medical school in 1960

55
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,100
and from the University of Michigan in 1956.

56
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Did you go to Michigan, too, Grandpa?

57
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,100
Yup. I graduated in 1937.

58
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:31,100
I've got to start thinking about college soon.

1
00:14:38,100 --> 00:15:02,100
OK, everybody.

2
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,100
I want to welcome Harry and his daughter Michelle

3
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
to Thanksgiving with us.

4
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
Thank you, Dr. Stewart.

5
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Call me Philip.

6
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
OK.

7
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
But first, I think we should take a moment

8
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
and remember the meaning of Thanksgiving.

9
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,100
Philip, I took Michelle to a school play Philip

10
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,100
about the first Thanksgiving.

11
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Well, why don't you tell us about that, Michelle?

12
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
Thanksgiving was about the Pilgrims,

13
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,100
the first settlers in America.

14
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
They shared the first harvest with the Indians

15
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,100
and gave thanks.

16
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
All right.

17
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,100
Then in that spirit let each of us give thanks.

18
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Each in his own way.

19
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
Who wants to begin?

20
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,100
I will.

21
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:45,100
I give thanks for being here with my family and for being well,

22
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,100
so I can enjoy you all.

23
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
All rihgt!

24
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,100
We love you, Grandpa.

25
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:57,100
I'd like to give thanks for a healthy year, a good job,

26
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,100
and for meeting Harry and Michelle.

27
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,100
We'd like to give thanks for meeting Susan

28
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,100
and the Stewart family.

29
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,100
I love you, Daddy.

30
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Thanks, Harry.

31
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100
That was very kind of you.

32
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,100
I'd like to give thanks for Grandpa coming to live with us.

33
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,100
And I'd also like to thank my math teacher

34
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
for giving me a passing grade.

35
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,100
And call me, Alexandra.

36
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,100
Oh, Robbie!

37
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,100
She'll call.

38
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
You go first, Marilyn.

39
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,100
I'm thinking.

40
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,100
You go first.

41
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Well, you all know I'm working on my photo album.

42
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
It's not finished yet.

43
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,100
And I'd like to thank Marilyn for being so patient.

44
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,100
Thanks, Richard.

45
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
I should thank you for encouraging me

46
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100
to keep working on my fashion designs.

47
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,100
I'm lucky to have a husband with an artistic eye.

48
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Oh, we have a lot to be thankful for.

49
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,100
For the food on this table.

50
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,100
Just like the Pilgrims.

51
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,100
I'll go along with that, Ellen.

52
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Well, help me serve, Robbie.

53
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:09,100
It was a wonderful meal, Mrs. Stewart.

54
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,100
Thank you.

55
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
And now to see the end of the football game.

56
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,100
Exactly.

57
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Where are you going, Philip?

58
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,100
Remember, the Michigan football game?

59
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,100
And Michigan needs a touchdown. Michigan

60
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,100
Did you forget something?

61
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
Dad, your famous apple pie.

62
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,100
Just let me see the score, Ellen.

63
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,100
Go ahead, Philip.

64
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
We should all take a little break before dessert.

65
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Oh, who could that be?

66
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Oh, it must be Alexandra.

67
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
I invited her to come by for dessert.

68
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
You did?

69
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,100
I like Ellen.

70
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
You know everyone, Alexandra.

71
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,100
No, she doesn't know Harry Bennett and his daughter Michelle.

72
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,100
Nice to meet you.

73
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,100
Hi.

74
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Hi.

75
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,100
Hello, Alexandra.

76
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
Hi, Marilyn.

77
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,500
Hi, Susan.

78
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,100
Happy Thanksgiving.

79
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,100
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie. Alexandra

80
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,100
Please sit down, Alexandra.

81
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,100
Dad, Richard--Alexandra's here.

82
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
Michigan needs a touchdown. Michigan

83
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
Three minutes to play.

84
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Hi, Alexandra. Welcome.

85
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,100
Hello, Alexandra.

86
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
Yes, Michigan needs a touchdown.

87
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,100
One tiny little touchdown, with just three minutes to play.

88
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
You want Michigan to win.

89
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,100
How'd you guess?

90
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,100
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie. Alexandra

91
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:42,100
What happened?

92
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,100
We forgot to turn the oven on.

93
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,100
We did?

94
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100
Philip, why don't you go Philip

95
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
watch the last three minutes of the game.

96
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,100
I will serve coffee and pumpkin pie.

97
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,100
OK. I'll be back in a few minutes.

98
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Robbie, would you bring the dessert plates. Robbie

99
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
And, Marilyn, would you pour coffee, please. Marilyn

100
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
Sure, Ellen.

101
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:11,100
How was your Thanksgiving dinner, Alexandra?

102
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
Just wonderful, Mr. Stewart.

103
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,100
The Molinas are a large family. Molina

104
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,101
I love being with them.

105
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,102
I'm glad you came by, Alexandra.

106
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,103
I am, too.

107
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:28,104
Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!

108
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,105
Great Thanksgiving.

109
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,106
Lots to be thankful for.

110
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,107
Michigan scored a touchdown. Michigan

111
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,108
Alexandra came by. Alexandra

112
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,109
And nobody misses Philip's famous apple pie.

113
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,110
Oh, Grandpa!
