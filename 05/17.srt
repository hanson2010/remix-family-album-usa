Episode 17 - Photo Finish

1
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,600
What are you doing?

2
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,600
I think I've got them.

3
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,600
You think you've got what?

4
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Performing arts... performing arts centers.

5
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
I think I've got them all, but I'm not sure.

6
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I think you have got it, Richard.

7
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Lincoln Center, home of the Metropolitan Opera,

8
00:02:51,600 --> 00:03:02,600
the New York City Ballet, the New York Philharmonic.

9
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Shubert Alley, center of the theater on Broadway.

10
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
And Carnegie Hall.

11
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,600
And the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.

12
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,600
And the Music Center in Los Angeles.

13
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:32,600
And the others. I do have it all.

14
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:40,600
You have been working on this for some time, Richard.

15
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I'm glad you feel you've finally put it all together.

16
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
What now?

17
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Now for the hard part.

18
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Oh, you think you're going to have a hard time

19
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
getting the album published?

20
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Well, it won't be easy.

21
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,600
So, what do you think you're going to do?

22
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Does the name Harvey Carlson ring a bell?

23
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Oh, yes! Harvey Carlson! I remember.

24
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
He said I should call him.

25
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,600
He's the publisher of the Carlson Publishing Company.

26
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
He said they need a new book of photographs,

27
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
and he really liked my concept.

28
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
So, why don't you call him in the morning?

29
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Do you think I have enough to show him?

30
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,600
I've been through every section with you, Richard.

31
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
It's quite complete.

32
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
And now that you're satisfied with the performing arts section,

33
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
I think you should show it to Mr. Carlson.

34
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,600
You're right. My Family Album, U.S.A. feels right.

35
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,600
I'll call in the morning and set up an appointment to see him.

36
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,600
He's going to love your work.

37
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Come on. Let's get some sleep.

38
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Is it too early to call Mr. Carlson?

39
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Seven after nine? No. I'm sure he's in his office.

40
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,600
His number is five, five, five, seven, five, three, two.

41
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Five, five, five, seven, five, three, two.

42
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Hello. Mr. Carlson, please.

43
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Mr. Carlson is busy at the moment. May I help you?

44
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,600
I'd like to make an appointment with him.

45
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
And your name is...?

46
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
My name is Richard Stewart.

47
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
He told me to call him about my project,

48
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Family Album, U.S.A.

49
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
One moment, please.

50
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:55,600
What's going on?

51
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,600
I guess they're trying to set up an appointment for me.

52
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Mr. Stewart, I just spoke to Mr. Carlson. Stewart.

53
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
He would like to see you.

54
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
But the only time he's available this week

55
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
is tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.

56
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Thanks. Thanks a lot. Good-bye.

57
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Well, it's done. Tomorrow morning at a publisher's office.

58
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Oh, it's so exciting, isn't it, Richard?

59
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Well, finally a publisher will see my work.

1
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Good morning.

2
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Good morning. My name is Richard Stewart.

3
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
I'm here to see Mr. Carlson.

4
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Please sit down, Mr. Stewart.

5
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Mr. Carlson will be with you shortly.

6
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Thank you.

7
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Excuse me, Mr. Carlson,

8
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
but Richard Stewart is here

9
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
for his ten o'clock appointment with you.

10
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
OK. Thank you.

11
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Like I said, he'll be with you shortly.

12
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Thank you.

13
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Yes, Mr. Carlson. Yes, sir.

14
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,600
He's ready for you, Mr. Stewart.

15
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Thank you. In there?

16
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Yes. In there. Good luck.

17
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Come in, come in.

18
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,600
This is a crazy morning. Hello, Richard.

19
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Hello, Mr. Carlson.

20
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Sit down, sit down.

21
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.

22
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
I hope you've brought your pictures along.

23
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I see that you have. Let's get right to it.

24
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,600
We need a new coffee-table book,

25
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,600
and a book of photos about the United States still feels right.

26
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
OK, let's take a look.

27
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Good. Very good. Family Album, U.S.A.

28
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
It's an excellent title.

29
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,600
If you had to describe the book in one sentence,

30
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
how would you do it?

31
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Well, I'd describe it as a book which is a...

32
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,600
a portrait of the United States -

33
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,600
the places, the people, mostly the people.

34
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,600
The things they do, the ways they live,

35
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
the places they visit, and the landmarks.

36
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
A photographic journey.

37
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
These are wonderful.

38
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,600
These photos in your performing arts section.

39
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center.

40
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I'm glad you like them.

41
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,600
I do, but...

42
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
But?

43
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,600
There's something missing. You've got a good eye, Richard.

44
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
You're a terrific photographer.

45
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,600
But before I can publish your work,

46
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
I need to meet with my marketing department,

47
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
and you've got to do one more thing.

48
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,600
What's that, Mr. Carlson?

49
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
In the section on culture,

50
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
you've included performing arts centers,

51
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
but you've left out street performance.

52
00:11:52,600 --> 00:12:00,600
The mimes.

53
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Richard, if you go out

54
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
and photograph street performances in the city,

55
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
you'll have it.

56
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,600
That is a great idea.

57
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
The performing arts centers and the street performances.

58
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
I'll do it.

59
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
If you do it, I'll publish your work.

60
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Are you serious?

61
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
I've never been more serious.

62
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,600
When do you think you can return with street performances?

63
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
A couple of weeks.

64
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,600
If they're as good as the rest of these pictures, it's a deal.

65
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,600
You won't be disappointed, Mr. Carlson. Thanks.

66
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Good-bye, Richard, and good luck. See you in two weeks.

67
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Good-bye, Mr. Carlson. Thanks.

68
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:51,600
So if you like the street-performance photos,

69
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,600
you'll really publish Family Album, U.S.A.?

70
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,600
When I say something, I mean it.

71
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Go to work. Good-bye.

72
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Good-bye.

1
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Two weeks. I said I could do it in two weeks, and I did it.

2
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,600
The pictures you've taken are fabulous, Richard.

3
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Mr. Carlson will love them.

4
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Monday morning.

5
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,600
I'm going to show him the photos on Monday morning.

6
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
I can't wait!

7
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:42,600
I'm very proud of you. You really did a beautiful job.

8
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:48,600
I know he will love the new photographs for your book.

9
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Yeah. I really did do a good job, didn't I?

10
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Hey, you know? There's still some film left on this roll,

11
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,600
and there's one person I haven't photographed in a long time.

12
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Who?

13
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
You.

14
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Richard! I haven't brushed my hair.

15
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
You look great!

16
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
It's not fair, Richard. I'm not even ready.

17
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Oh, that's wonderful! That's wonderful!

18
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Wonderful!

19
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Thanks.

20
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Fabulous!

21
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Thanks.

22
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Terrific!

23
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Thanks.

24
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
They get better and better.

25
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Thanks a lot.

26
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,600
This is sensational!

27
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Yeah. Thanks.

28
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,600
What a job! Good work, Richard!

29
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
I'm so glad you like them so much.

30
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Like them? They represent your best work.

31
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Really?

32
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Absolutely.

33
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Well... what do you think? Do I have my book?

34
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,600
You do. You do. There's a book here.

35
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,600
I'll have a contract

36
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
and an advance payment waiting for you

37
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
first thing in the morning.

38
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Thank you.

39
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
And while you're here,

40
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
I would like to introduce you to your editor.

41
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
And I want you to meet the people in the art department.

42
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,600
I'll set up an appointment with the marketing people.

43
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
When do you think we'll be through?

44
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,600
In about half an hour. Why?

45
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
I can't wait to tell Marilyn!
