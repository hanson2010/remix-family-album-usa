1
00:2:4,600-->00:2:7,600
Good morning, Susan.

2
00:2:7,600-->00:2:9,600
Good morning, Sam.

3
00:2:9,600-->00:2:15,600
What's the schedule today?

4
00:2:15,600-->00:2:19,600
Ten o'clock,

5
00:2:19,600-->00:2:21,600
telephone FAO Schwarz about the new twin baby dolls.

6
00:2:21,600-->00:2:22,600
OK.

7
00:2:22,600-->00:2:25,600
Telephone Mrs. Zaskey at the advertising agency.

8
00:2:25,600-->00:2:27,600
I did that. Go on.

9
00:2:27,600-->00:2:29,600
Eleven o'clock, approve the sketches for the toy spaceship.

10
00:2:29,600-->00:2:31,600
Where are they?

11
00:2:31,600-->00:2:32,600
Right here.

12
00:2:32,600-->00:2:34,600
Did you look at them?

13
00:2:34,600-->00:2:35,600
Yes, I did.

14
00:2:35,600-->00:2:38,600
What do you think of the spaceship?

15
00:2:38,600-->00:2:40,600
I think the kids'll love it.

16
00:2:40,600-->00:2:42,600
Would you show me the drawings, please?

17
00:2:42,600-->00:2:43,600
Huh.

18
00:2:43,600-->00:2:52,600

19
00:2:52,600-->00:2:55,600
Now, what else is on the schedule today?

20
00:2:55,600-->00:2:57,600
Well, at one o'clock

21
00:2:57,600-->00:2:59,600
you have a lunch appointment with Mr. Levine,

22
00:2:59,600-->00:3:1,600
the client from the Toytown Stores.

23
00:3:1,600-->00:3:2,600
Where?

24
00:3:2,600-->00:3:3,600
At Rossano's.

25
00:3:3,600-->00:3:5,600
Hmm. Anything else?

26
00:3:5,600-->00:3:7,600
At four o'clock,

27
00:3:7,600-->00:3:8,600
you have a meeting with the production staff

28
00:3:8,600-->00:3:9,600
in the conference room.

29
00:3:9,600-->00:3:12,600
Make sure everybody is at that meeting.

30
00:3:12,600-->00:3:13,600
Will do.

31
00:3:13,600-->00:3:16,600
At six you're meeting, Mr. Ozawa.

32
00:3:16,600-->00:3:18,600
Oh, yes. Are his models here?

33
00:3:18,600-->00:3:19,600
They're in my office.

34
00:3:19,600-->00:3:20,600
I'd like to see them.

35
00:3:20,600-->00:3:21,600
Right.

36
00:3:21,600-->00:3:22,600
What else?

37
00:3:22,600-->00:3:29,600
Come on, Sam ...

38
00:3:29,600-->00:3:32,600
You work too hard, Susan.

39
00:3:32,600-->00:3:35,600
When was your last day off?

40
00:3:35,600-->00:3:38,600
Hmm. I can't remember.

41
00:3:38,600-->00:3:40,600
You really ought to take some time off.

42
00:3:40,600-->00:3:41,600
What for?

43
00:3:41,600-->00:3:44,600
To enjoy the simple things in life ...

44
00:3:44,600-->00:3:46,600
I know, Sam.

45
00:3:46,600-->00:3:49,600
Maybe soon.

46
00:3:49,600-->00:3:52,600
To smell the flowers.

47
00:3:52,600-->00:3:55,600
Oh, wait a minute. What's today's date?

48
00:3:55,600-->00:3:57,600
Today is the twelfth. Why?

49
00:3:57,600-->00:4:1,600
It seems to me I scheduled something else.

50
00:4:1,600-->00:4:7,600
There's nothing else in the appointment book.

51
00:4:7,600-->00:4:9,600
I'm sure I did.

52
00:4:9,600-->00:4:13,600
Oh, well, I'll probably remember it later.

53
00:4:13,600-->00:4:16,600
I hope it isn't important.

54
00:4:16,600-->00:4:17,600
Hmm. It's probably nothing.

55
00:4:17,600-->00:4:19,600
OK, let's get started.

56
00:4:19,600-->00:4:13,600
Would you call Priscilla Smith at FAO Schwarz, please?

57
00:4:13,600-->00:4:24,600
Right.

58
00:4:24,600-->00:4:33,600
These are the models from the Japanese film maker.

59
00:4:33,600-->00:4:35,600
Thank you. Just put them on my desk.

60
00:4:35,600-->00:4:42,600
And the new drawings for the toy spaceship.

61
00:4:42,600-->00:4:44,600
Wonderful.

62
00:4:44,600-->00:4:54,600
That was fast.

63
00:4:54,600-->00:4:55,600
We have a new artist.

64
00:4:55,600-->00:4:56,600
She's very talented.

65
00:4:56,600-->00:4:58,600
What time is it, anyway?

66
00:4:58,600-->00:4:59,600
My watch stopped.

67
00:4:59,600-->00:5:0,600
It's eleven thirty.

68
00:5:0,600-->00:5:3,600
What time is my lunch date with Bill Levine?

69
00:5:3,600-->00:5:5,600
One o'clock.

70
00:5:5,600-->00:5:8,600
Remind me to leave at twelve forty-five.

71
00:5:8,600-->00:5:12,600
Did you remember your other appointment for today?

72
00:5:12,600-->00:5:14,600
No,

73
00:5:14,600-->00:5:15,600
but I have a feeling

74
00:5:15,600-->00:5:17,600
it's going to be too late when I do remember.

75
00:5:17,600-->00:5:31,600
Yes, Sam?

76
00:5:31,600-->00:5:34,600
I just solved the mystery.

77
00:5:34,600-->00:5:36,600
What did I forget?

78
00:5:36,600-->00:5:39,600
You have some guests in the reception room.

79
00:5:39,600-->00:5:41,600
What? Who?

80
00:5:41,600-->00:5:44,600
Mr. Harry Bennett and his daughter. Harry Bennett

81
00:5:44,600-->00:5:45,600
I remember!

82
00:5:45,600-->00:5:48,600
Oh ... Harry!

83
00:5:48,600-->00:5:52,600
I made a lunch date with him and his daughter weeks ago.

84
00:5:52,600-->00:5:55,600
Is he a client?

85
00:5:55,600-->00:5:58,600
He's a friend.

86
00:5:58,600-->00:6:2,600
Well, he's here with his daughter to have lunch.

87
00:6:2,600-->00:6:4,600
I met her at Thanksgiving,

88
00:6:4,600-->00:6:7,600
and I promised to have lunch with both of them today.

89
00:6:7,600-->00:6:10,600
Yes, indeed.

90
00:6:10,600-->00:6:13,600
What are you going to do about your appointment

91
00:6:13,600-->00:6:14,600
with Mr. Levine?

92
00:6:14,600-->00:6:17,600
Any suggestions?

93
00:6:17,600-->00:6:21,600
Oh!
