00:0:40,600-->00:0:43,600
Philip... Ellen.

2
00:0:43,600-->00:0:45,600
Ah, Judge.

3
00:0:45,600-->00:0:47,600
How are you?

4
00:0:47,600-->00:0:49,600
I think it's time for the wedding to begin.

5
00:0:49,600-->00:0:56,600
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

6
00:0:56,600-->00:0:57,600
Please take your places.

7
00:0:57,600-->00:1:0,600
The wedding ceremony is about to begin.

8
00:1:0,600-->00:1:22,600

9
00:1:22,600-->00:1:25,600
OK, Jane. Start the music.

10
00:1:25,600-->00:2:17,600

11
00:2:17,600-->00:2:20,600
Dearly beloved,

12
00:2:20,600-->00:2:23,600
we are gathered here today

13
00:2:23,600-->00:2:27,600
to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.

14
00:2:27,600-->00:2:30,600
Do either of you have any reason

15
00:2:30,600-->00:2:34,600
why you should not be legally joined in marriage?

16
00:2:34,600-->00:2:37,600
Is there anyone present who can show

17
00:2:37,600-->00:2:39,600
any just cause why these two people

18
00:2:39,600-->00:2:43,600
should not be legally joined in marriage?

19
00:2:43,600-->00:2:50,600
Then, Harry Bennett, do you take Susan Stewart

20
00:2:50,600-->00:2:53,600
to be your lawful, wedded wife?

21
00:2:53,600-->00:2:55,600
I do.

22
00:2:55,600-->00:2:58,600
And you, Susan Stewart,

23
00:2:58,600-->00:3:0,600
do you take Harry Bennett

24
00:3:0,600-->00:3:2,600
to be your lawful, wedded husband?

25
00:3:2,600-->00:3:5,600
I do.

26
00:3:5,600-->00:3:7,600
The rings, please.

27
00:3:7,600-->00:3:12,600
I have them, Harry.

28
00:3:12,600-->00:3:35,600

29
00:3:35,600-->00:3:42,600
By the power vested in me by the laws of the State of New York,

30
00:3:42,600-->00:3:45,600
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

31
00:3:45,600-->00:3:49,600
You may kiss the bride now, Harry.

32
00:3:49,600-->00:4:1,600
