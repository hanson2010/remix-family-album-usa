00:2:15,600-->00:2:18,600
Hi, Mom.

2
00:2:18,600-->00:2:19,600
Hi, Robbie.

3
00:2:19,600-->00:2:20,600
You're home from school early.

4
00:2:20,600-->00:2:22,600
Yeah, they're getting the assembly hall

5
00:2:22,600-->00:2:23,600
ready for the graduation ceremony,

6
00:2:23,600-->00:2:25,600
so we all got to go home early.

7
00:2:25,600-->00:2:27,600
Too noisy to study.

8
00:2:27,600-->00:2:28,600
Well, now that you're here,

9
00:2:28,600-->00:2:29,600
you can help me with dinner.

10
00:2:29,600-->00:2:32,600
I need those potatoes peeled and sliced.

11
00:2:32,600-->00:2:35,600
Mom, give me a break.

12
00:2:35,600-->00:2:39,600
Alexandra's coming over to help me study for my math final Alexandra

13
00:2:39,600-->00:2:41,600
Well, in that case,

14
00:2:41,600-->00:2:44,600
you can wash the dishes and clean up after dinner.

15
00:2:44,600-->00:2:48,600
Can I invite Alexandra to stay for dinner?

16
00:2:48,600-->00:2:49,600
Of course.

17
00:2:49,600-->00:2:51,600
Thanks, Mom.

18
00:2:51,600-->00:2:56,600
You and Alexandra

19
00:2:56,600-->00:2:58,600
have become good friends, haven't you?

20
00:2:58,600-->00:3:0,600
Yes. I like her.

21
00:3:0,600-->00:3:1,600
She's a terrific person.

22
00:3:1,600-->00:3:5,600
I'm going to miss her

23
00:3:5,600-->00:3:7,600
when she goes back to Greece.

24
00:3:7,600-->00:3:12,600
Would you like to give her a little farewell party?

25
00:3:12,600-->00:3:14,600
Mom, that would be terrific!

26
00:3:14,600-->00:3:17,600
Maybe we could make it a surprise.

27
00:3:17,600-->00:3:19,600
Oh, I don't know.

28
00:3:19,600-->00:3:21,600
Surprise parties don't always work out.

29
00:3:21,600-->00:3:24,600
Well, we could tell her

30
00:3:24,600-->00:3:26,600
it's a graduation party for me.

31
00:3:26,600-->00:3:28,600
When Alexandra arrives,

32
00:3:28,600-->00:3:30,600
we'll surprise her.

33
00:3:30,600-->00:3:32,600
Well, I suppose that might work.

34
00:3:32,600-->00:3:36,600
I'd like to give her a nice going-away present.

35
00:3:36,600-->00:3:37,600
Fine.

36
00:3:37,600-->00:3:39,600
There's only one problem.

37
00:3:39,600-->00:3:41,600
What's that?

38
00:3:41,600-->00:3:44,600
I'm broke.

39
00:3:44,600-->00:3:46,600
I should have saved some money.

40
00:3:46,600-->00:3:48,600
I'm sure Alexandra

41
00:3:48,600-->00:3:50,600
would be happy with something simple, Robbie.

42
00:3:50,600-->00:3:51,600
I know.

43
00:3:51,600-->00:3:52,600
But, well,

44
00:3:52,600-->00:3:55,600
I'd like to give her something nice

45
00:3:55,600-->00:3:56,600
to remember me by.

46
00:3:56,600-->00:4:0,600
Maybe I could borrow some money from you and Dad.

47
00:4:0,600-->00:4:2,600
It's all right with me

48
00:4:2,600-->00:4:4,600
if it's all right with your dad.

49
00:4:4,600-->00:4:5,600
Thanks, Mom.

50
00:4:5,600-->00:4:6,600
I'll talk to him.

51
00:4:6,600-->00:4:8,600
Is he still in his office?

52
00:4:8,600-->00:4:9,600
I think so.

53
00:4:9,600-->00:4:11,600
Thanks, Mom.

54
00:4:11,600-->00:4:19,600
Robbie! Good luck! Robbie

55
00:4:19,600-->00:4:36,600

56
00:4:36,600-->00:4:38,600
Here are the X-rays you wanted, Dr. Stewart.

57
00:4:38,600-->00:4:40,600
Oh. Thank you, Molly.

58
00:4:40,600-->00:4:42,600
Now, let me check them.

59
00:4:42,600-->00:4:53,600

60
00:4:53,600-->00:4:55,600
What do you think?

61
00:4:55,600-->00:4:58,600
I don't see any breaks or fractures.

62
00:4:58,600-->00:5:2,600
Well, well. Thank you, Molly.

63
00:5:2,600-->00:5:4,600
Thank you.

64
00:5:4,600-->00:5:18,600

65
00:5:18,600-->00:5:19,600
Come in!

66
00:5:19,600-->00:5:22,600
Hi, Son.

67
00:5:22,600-->00:5:25,600
Hi, Dad. Am I interrupting you?

68
00:5:25,600-->00:5:27,600
No, no, no, no.

69
00:5:27,600-->00:5:28,600
What's up?

70
00:5:28,600-->00:5:29,600
Can we talk?

71
00:5:29,600-->00:5:30,600
Sure.

72
00:5:30,600-->00:5:33,600
I need some help.

73
00:5:33,600-->00:5:36,600
Well, that's what fathers are for.

74
00:5:36,600-->00:5:38,600
Well, before I go to college,

75
00:5:38,600-->00:5:40,600
I have the whole summer ...

76
00:5:40,600-->00:5:41,600
Yes ...

77
00:5:41,600-->00:5:43,500
And I'm planning to get a job for the summer.

78
00:5:43,600-->00:5:46,600
And what sort of job?

79
00:5:46,600-->00:5:49,600
I applied for a job as a lifeguard at the community pool.

80
00:5:49,600-->00:5:52,600
Sounds pretty good.

81
00:5:52,600-->00:5:55,600
Yes. I'll be earning pretty good money if I get it.

82
00:5:55,600-->00:5:58,600
But right now, I'm kind of short of cash.

83
00:5:58,600-->00:6:1,600
Who isn't?

84
00:6:1,600-->00:6:5,600
And my friend Alexandra is going back to Greece ...

85
00:6:5,600-->00:6:7,600
Nice girl.

86
00:6:7,600-->00:6:8,600
We'll all miss her.

87
00:6:8,600-->00:6:12,600
Mom says we can give her a going-away surprise party.

88
00:6:12,600-->00:6:13,600
Good idea.

89
00:6:13,600-->00:6:16,600
And I'd like to get her a nice gift ...

90
00:6:16,600-->00:6:18,600
What'd you have in mind?

91
00:6:18,600-->00:6:22,200
Well, a wristwatch,

92
00:6:22,200-->00:6:25,600
so she'll think of me when she looks at the time.

93
00:6:25,600-->00:6:27,600
Nothing flashy or expensive.

94
00:6:27,600-->00:6:30,600
Something simple--but a good one.

95
00:6:30,600-->00:6:33,600
Sounds fine, Robbie.

96
00:6:33,600-->00:6:35,600
Well, I saw a nice watch.

97
00:6:35,600-->00:6:37,600
But I'll need a loan.

98
00:6:37,600-->00:6:39,600
If you could lend me the money,

99
00:6:39,600-->00:6:42,600
I could pay you back out of my lifeguard salary.

100
00:6:42,600-->00:6:48,600
Well, I guess your mother and I can manage it.

101
00:6:48,600-->00:6:51,600
When do you need the money?

102
00:6:51,600-->00:6:53,600
Would tomorrow be OK?

103
00:6:53,600-->00:6:57,600
You've got it.

104
00:6:57,600-->00:6:59,600
Thanks, Dad.

105
00:6:59,600-->00:7:1,600
My pleasure, Son.

106
00:7:1,600-->00:7:4,600
Oh, and, Robbie ...

107
00:7:4,600-->00:7:5,600
Yes?

108
00:7:5,600-->00:7:8,600
You'll probably want the family car

109
00:7:8,600-->00:7:11,600
so you can drive her home after the party.

110
00:7:11,600-->00:7:12,600
Could I?

111
00:7:12,600-->00:7:19,400
If you drive carefully.

112
00:7:19,400-->00:7:22,600
I will. Thanks, Dad.

113
00:7:22,600-->00:7:24,600
My pleasure.

114
00:7:24,600-->00:7:26,600
You're OK, Dad.

115
00:7:26,600-->00:7:30,600
You're not so bad yourself, Son.
