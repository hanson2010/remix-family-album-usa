1
00:2:37,600-->00:2:40,600
Is that you, Susan?

2
00:2:40,600-->00:2:43,600
It's me, Grandpa.

3
00:2:43,600-->00:2:46,600
Am I glad to see you!

4
00:2:46,600-->00:2:48,600
And am I glad to see you!

5
00:2:48,600-->00:2:51,600
I am also glad to be here.

6
00:2:51,600-->00:2:53,600
How are things?

7
00:2:53,600-->00:2:58,600
I have been talking to a group of salesmen

8
00:2:58,600-->00:2:59,600
since ten this morning,

9
00:2:59,600-->00:3:1,600
and I'm real exhausted.

10
00:3:1,600-->00:3:3,600
Well, you look good.

11
00:3:3,600-->00:3:6,600
What's Harry doing tonight?

12
00:3:6,600-->00:3:7,600
He and Michelle

13
00:3:7,600-->00:3:9,600
are visiting relatives in New Jersey today.

14
00:3:9,600-->00:3:11,600
The rest of our family went to the movies.

15
00:3:11,600-->00:3:15,600
So it's just you and me, Susan.

16
00:3:15,600-->00:3:18,600
It's nice to be alone with you, Grandpa.

17
00:3:18,600-->00:3:20,600
We don't get to see enough of each other.

18
00:3:20,600-->00:3:22,600
Oh, I feel the same way, Susan.

19
00:3:22,600-->00:3:24,600
I miss seeing you.

20
00:3:24,600-->00:3:26,600
But to tell the truth,

21
00:3:26,600-->00:3:28,600
next time

22
00:3:28,600-->00:3:31,600
I'd like to go into the city and meet you there,

23
00:3:31,600-->00:3:33,600
instead of you coming here.

24
00:3:33,600-->00:3:35,600
You don't need to do that, Grandpa.

25
00:3:35,600-->00:3:37,600
Yeah, I do.

26
00:3:37,600-->00:3:39,600
I need to get out more.

27
00:3:39,600-->00:3:42,600
Well, I mean

28
00:3:42,600-->00:3:46,600
there's a lot to do around the house,

29
00:3:46,600-->00:3:48,600
and I love being here with the family,

30
00:3:48,600-->00:3:49,600
you know,

31
00:3:49,600-->00:3:51,600
but I'm restless.

32
00:3:51,600-->00:3:54,600
Since I retired,

33
00:3:54,600-->00:3:56,600
I've got extra time on my hands.

34
00:3:56,600-->00:3:59,600
I understand, Grandpa.

35
00:3:59,600-->00:4:2,600
I think you do.

36
00:4:2,600-->00:4:4,600
Frankly,

37
00:4:4,600-->00:4:7,600
I'd like to use my brain a little more.

38
00:4:7,600-->00:4:8,600
Grandpa,

39
00:4:8,600-->00:4:13,600
you have so much energy and so many years of experience.

40
00:4:13,600-->00:4:17,600
There are probably a lot of places for you to work

41
00:4:17,600-->00:4:19,600
Particularly in the construction field.

42
00:4:19,600-->00:4:22,600
But at my age,

43
00:4:22,600-->00:4:24,600
I'm not looking for a full-time job.

44
00:4:24,600-->00:4:26,600
I'm retired.

45
00:4:26,600-->00:4:29,600
But I'm bored.

46
00:4:29,600-->00:4:32,600
Well, there must be something.

47
00:4:32,600-->00:4:36,600
Maybe I can help.

48
00:4:36,600-->00:4:40,600
Let's go into the kitchen,

49
00:4:40,600-->00:4:44,600
and maybe you can help me set the table.

50
00:4:44,600-->00:4:45,600
Sounds good to me.

51
00:4:45,600-->00:4:47,600
What are we having?

52
00:4:47,600-->00:4:49,600
I prepared lamb chops,

53
00:4:49,600-->00:4:52,600
mashed potatoes, and a tossed green salad to begin with.

54
00:4:52,600-->00:4:56,600
Grandpa, you are a terrific guy!

55
00:4:56,600-->00:5:8,600
You're still thinking about something to do, aren't you?

56
00:5:8,600-->00:5:10,600
A job of some kind.

57
00:5:10,600-->00:5:11,600
That's right.

58
00:5:11,600-->00:5:16,600
I've been thinking about it for weeks now.

59
00:5:16,600-->00:5:19,600
There must be some way to put my mind to good use.

60
00:5:19,600-->00:5:22,600
We'll find a solution.

61
00:5:22,600-->00:5:25,600
A positive solution

62
00:5:25,600-->00:5:28,600
to your finding a way to use that wonderful mind of yours.
