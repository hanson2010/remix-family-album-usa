00:0:58,600-->00:1:4,600
Hello. Hello there.

2
00:1:4,600-->00:1:6,600
Are you ready for lunch with your grandpa?

3
00:1:6,600-->00:1:12,600
Oh! Hi, Grandpa. Yes, of course, I am, but my mind isn't.

4
00:1:12,600-->00:1:13,600
What's the matter, Susan?

5
00:1:13,600-->00:1:15,600
A real dilemma.

6
00:1:15,600-->00:1:17,600
Does it have anything to do with you and Harry?

7
00:1:17,600-->00:1:21,600
Yes, but I don't know where to start.

8
00:1:21,600-->00:1:27,600
Maybe I can help. Tell me what it is, Susan.

9
00:1:27,600-->00:1:31,600
Thanks, Grandpa. Please sit down.

10
00:1:31,600-->00:1:37,600
Oh! Harry has been offered a job in Los Angeles.

11
00:1:37,600-->00:1:41,600
Well, this is something to think about.

12
00:1:41,600-->00:1:45,600
There are so many things to consider. There's Michelle.

13
00:1:45,600-->00:1:51,600
I wonder if a move would be a bad thing for her. And my job.

14
00:1:51,600-->00:1:53,600
I don't know if I can get a good job in Los Angeles.

15
00:1:53,600-->00:1:56,600
And what about our family?

16
00:1:56,600-->00:2:0,600
Can I tell you what I think?

17
00:2:0,600-->00:2:2,600
Tell me.

18
00:2:2,600-->00:2:5,600
I think that you're very successful

19
00:2:5,600-->00:2:10,600
and that you have a fantastic reputation in the toy industry.

20
00:2:10,600-->00:2:13,600
I think you could talk to Mr. Marchetta,

21
00:2:13,600-->00:2:15,600
and I think

22
00:2:15,600-->00:2:19,600
he could help you find a real good job in Los Angeles.

23
00:2:19,600-->00:2:22,600
He was very helpful to me, remember?

24
00:2:22,600-->00:2:25,600
I suppose I could call him.

25
00:2:25,600-->00:2:28,600
But I'm not so sure that I want to leave New York,

26
00:2:28,600-->00:2:30,600
you, and the rest of our family.

27
00:2:30,600-->00:2:32,600
Well, I'm not going to kid you, Susan.

28
00:2:32,600-->00:2:33,600
You know we'd all miss you.

29
00:2:33,600-->00:2:37,600
But this should be your decision.

30
00:2:37,600-->00:2:41,600
It's something that only you and Harry can work out.

31
00:2:41,600-->00:2:47,600
If moving to L.A. is in Harry's best interest,

32
00:2:47,600-->00:2:50,600
I have to do what I can do to support him.

33
00:2:50,600-->00:2:53,600
In every marriage,

34
00:2:53,600-->00:2:56,600
sacrifices have to be made by one partner from time to time.

35
00:2:56,600-->00:2:59,600
And what about Michelle?

36
00:2:59,600-->00:3:2,600
Well, what do you think?

37
00:3:2,600-->00:3:6,600
I think Michelle is better off staying where she is.

38
00:3:6,600-->00:3:8,600
What does she think?

39
00:3:8,600-->00:3:11,600
I don't know for sure.

40
00:3:11,600-->00:3:12,600
Well, you'll have to ask her.

41
00:3:12,600-->00:3:15,600
I think I'm going to have a talk with Mr. Marchetta

42
00:3:15,600-->00:3:17,600
and get his feelings about my leaving.

43
00:3:17,600-->00:3:20,600
And about helping me find a job in Los Angeles.

44
00:3:20,600-->00:3:22,600
Good idea.

45
00:3:22,600-->00:3:24,600
I'll call him right now. No point in delaying.

46
00:3:24,600-->00:3:27,600
Thanks, Grandpa.

47
00:3:27,600-->00:3:41,600
Harry, it's the perfect job for you. You'll love it. Harry

48
00:3:41,600-->00:3:43,600
It's a big decision for me, Bill.

49
00:3:43,600-->00:3:46,600
And I have to discuss it with my wife.

50
00:3:46,600-->00:3:47,600
I don't know if it's right for her.

51
00:3:47,600-->00:3:51,600
She'll love it. It's a once-in-a-lifetime offer, Harry.

52
00:3:51,600-->00:3:53,600
OK. Tell it to me again.

53
00:3:53,600-->00:3:55,600
The company is Craft and Craft,

54
00:3:55,600-->00:3:57,600
the biggest accounting company in the country.

55
00:3:57,600-->00:3:59,600
I know the company well. It's big.

56
00:3:59,600-->00:4:1,600
The biggest.

57
00:4:1,600-->00:4:5,600
Yeah, yeah. The biggest. When do I have to let you know?

58
00:4:5,600-->00:4:9,600
Talk it over. Think it over. Let me know by the end of the week.

59
00:4:9,600-->00:4:12,600
When would we have to move?

60
00:4:12,600-->00:4:14,600
As soon as possible.

61
00:4:14,600-->00:4:17,600
I also have my daughter to consider.

62
00:4:17,600-->00:4:19,600
I don't want to interrupt her school year.

63
00:4:19,600-->00:4:21,600
Let me know by the end of the week.

64
00:4:21,600-->00:4:23,600
It's a great opportunity for you, Harry.

65
00:4:23,600-->00:4:24,600
Believe me.

66
00:4:24,600-->00:4:25,600
I know.

67
00:4:25,600-->00:4:28,600
Craft and Craft is the biggest in the country. Craft and Crraft

68
00:4:28,600-->00:4:34,600
Yeah, I know. The biggest.

69
00:4:34,600-->00:4:41,600

70
00:4:41,600-->00:4:46,600
I think Michelle is asleep now. Let's talk.

71
00:4:46,600-->00:4:55,600
I met with Bill York today.

72
00:4:55,600-->00:4:59,600
And I talked with Mr. Marchetta. Did York make the offer?

73
00:4:59,600-->00:5:1,600
Yup. He asked me if I want the job.

74
00:5:1,600-->00:5:3,600
That's exciting, Harry. What was it?

75
00:5:3,600-->00:5:5,600
A vice-presidency

76
00:5:5,600-->00:5:7,600
with the biggest accounting company in the country--

77
00:5:7,600-->00:5:9,600
Craft and Craft. Craft and Crraft

78
00:5:9,600-->00:5:11,600
Aren't you excited about that?

79
00:5:11,600-->00:5:14,600
Sure I am. But there's so much more to consider.

80
00:5:14,600-->00:5:18,600
I talked to Mr. Marchetta.

81
00:5:18,600-->00:5:20,600
What did he say? Did you tell him about me?

82
00:5:20,600-->00:5:23,600
Of course, Harry. I want what's best for you,

83
00:5:23,600-->00:5:26,600
and I think I can get a good job

84
00:5:26,600-->00:5:27,600
through Mr. Marchetta

85
00:5:27,600-->00:5:28,600
in Los Angeles also.

86
00:5:28,600-->00:5:29,600
You're kidding.

87
00:5:29,600-->00:5:30,600
No, I'm not kidding.

88
00:5:30,600-->00:5:32,600
I talked with him, and he understands completely.

89
00:5:32,600-->00:5:35,600
He has a major toy buyer in Los Angeles,

90
00:5:35,600-->00:5:38,600
and he's pretty sure that I can get a good job there.

91
00:5:38,600-->00:5:39,600
Unbelievable!

92
00:5:39,600-->00:5:42,600
But I think we should talk to Michelle about all of this.

93
00:5:42,600-->00:5:46,600
You're right. We'll talk to her about it.

94
00:5:46,600-->00:5:50,600
And how do you feel about taking the job in Los Angeles?

95
00:5:50,600-->00:5:52,600
How should I feel?

96
00:5:52,600-->00:5:53,600
It's the biggest company in the country.

97
00:5:53,600-->00:5:56,600
Well, then you feel good about taking it?

98
00:5:56,600-->00:6:1,600
Well ... I feel fine about it. Why shouldn't I?
