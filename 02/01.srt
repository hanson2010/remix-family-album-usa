1
00:2:34,600-->00:2:37,000
Excuse me.

2
00:2:37,000-->00:2:40,000
My name is Richard Stewart.

3
00:2:40,000-->00:2:41,000
I'm a photographer.

4
00:2:41,000-->00:2:43,000
May I take a picture of you and your little boy?

5
00:2:43,000-->00:2:43,500
What's it for?

6
00:2:43,500-->00:2:44,600
It's for a book.

7
00:2:44,600-->00:2:46,600
You're writing a book?

8
00:2:46,600-->00:2:48,600
It's a book of pictures.

9
00:2:48,600-->00:2:49,600
I call it Family Album, U.S.A.

10
00:2:49,600-->00:2:51,600
Oh, that's a nice idea.

11
00:2:51,600-->00:2:53,600
Well, it's fine if you take our picture.

12
00:2:53,600-->00:2:54,600
I'm Martha Vann.

13
00:2:54,600-->00:2:57,600
Thank you. I appreciate your help.

14
00:2:57,600-->00:3:0,600
I'm Richard. What's your name?

15
00:3:0,600-->00:3:1,600
Gerald. Gerald

16
00:3:1,600-->00:3:2,600
How old are you, Gerald?

17
00:3:2,600-->00:3:3,600
Five.

18
00:3:3,600-->00:3:4,600
And where do you live?

19
00:3:4,600-->00:3:6,600
We live in California.

20
00:3:6,600-->00:3:8,600
Well, welcome to New York.

21
00:3:8,600-->00:3:11,600
OK, just a second.

22
00:3:11,600-->00:3:14,600
I'm almost ready here.

23
00:3:14,600-->00:3:15,600
Can I help you?

24
00:3:15,600-->00:3:17,600
Oh, please.

25
00:3:17,600-->00:3:26,600
Hold Gerald's hand, please.

26
00:3:26,600-->00:3:30,600
Great!

27
00:3:30,600-->00:3:32,600
Now point to the buildings.

28
00:3:32,600-->00:3:36,600
Terrific!

29
00:3:36,600-->00:3:41,600
Give Mommy a kiss, Gerald.

30
00:3:41,600-->00:3:44,600
Nice!

31
00:3:44,600-->00:3:47,600
Thank you, Gerald.

32
00:3:47,600-->00:3:50,600
And thank you, Mrs. Vann.

33
00:3:50,600-->00:3:51,600
Oh, my pleasure.

34
00:3:51,600-->00:3:52,600
We'll be looking for your book.

35
00:3:52,600-->00:3:55,600
Thank you. Good-bye. Bye, Gerald.

36
00:3:55,600-->00:3:59,600
Thanks again.

37
00:3:59,600-->00:4:1,600
Oh, you're welcome.

38
00:4:1,600-->00:4:3,600
Hey, let me take your picture!

39
00:4:3,600-->00:4:6,600
Wonderful. Please.

40
00:4:6,600-->00:4:13,600
Are you from New York?

41
00:4:13,600-->00:4:15,600
No, I'm from Greece.

42
00:4:15,600-->00:4:16,600
I'm an exchange student.

43
00:4:16,600-->00:4:19,600
When did you come here?

44
00:4:19,600-->00:4:21,600
Three months ago.

45
00:4:21,600-->00:4:23,600
Your English is very good.

46
00:4:23,600-->00:4:24,600
Thanks.

47
00:4:24,600-->00:4:26,600
I studied English in school.

48
00:4:26,600-->00:4:32,600
Would you like some coffee?

49
00:4:32,600-->00:4:33,600
No, thank you.

50
00:4:33,600-->00:4:36,600
Tell me about your book.

51
00:4:36,600-->00:4:38,600
Oh, it's not finished yet,

52
00:4:38,600-->00:4:40,600
but I have some of the pictures.

53
00:4:40,600-->00:4:41,600
Would you like to see them?

54
00:4:41,600-->00:4:42,600
Yes. I'd like that.

55
00:4:42,600-->00:4:45,600
Here they are.

56
00:4:45,600-->00:4:49,600
Family Album, U.S.A.

57
00:4:49,600-->00:4:52,600
It's an album of pictures of the United States:

58
00:4:52,600-->00:4:55,600
the cities, the special places, and the people.

59
00:4:55,600-->00:4:57,600
And these are pictures of people working:

60
00:4:57,600-->00:5:6,600
steelworkers, bankers, police, street vendors,

61
00:5:6,600-->00:5:14,600
ambulance drivers, doctors...

62
00:5:14,600-->00:5:16,600
Oh, this is my father. He's a doctor.

63
00:5:16,600-->00:5:20,600
This is my mother.

64
00:5:20,600-->00:5:21,600
What's her name?

65
00:5:21,600-->00:5:22,600
Ellen.

66
00:5:22,600-->00:5:26,600
My younger brother, Robbie.

67
00:5:26,600-->00:5:27,600
He goes to high school.

68
00:5:27,600-->00:5:29,600
This is my sister Susan.

69
00:5:29,600-->00:5:32,600
She works for a toy company.

70
00:5:32,600-->00:5:36,600
Here's my grandfather.

71
00:5:36,600-->00:5:38,600
He lives in Florida.

72
00:5:38,600-->00:5:39,600
And this is my wife Marilyn.

73
00:5:39,600-->00:5:41,600
Oh, she's very pretty.

74
00:5:41,600-->00:5:43,600
Thanks. And what about your family?

75
00:5:43,600-->00:5:46,600
They are in Thessaloniki.

76
00:5:46,600-->00:5:50,600
That's a large city in northern Greece.

77
00:5:50,600-->00:5:52,600
But now I'm living in the Bronx.

78
00:5:52,600-->00:5:54,600
With a Greek-American family?

79
00:5:54,600-->00:5:56,600
No. Hispanic.

80
00:5:56,600-->00:6:4,600
Oh no! It's five thirty.

81
00:6:4,600-->00:6:5,600
Will you excuse me?

82
00:6:5,600-->00:6:7,600
I have to meet my wife.

83
00:6:7,600-->00:6:9,600
It was nice meeting you.

84
00:6:9,600-->00:6:11,600
It was a pleasure meeting you, too.

85
00:6:11,600-->00:6:12,600
Thanks for your help.

86
00:6:12,600-->00:6:15,600
And good luck! I've got to go.

87
00:6:15,600-->00:6:16,600
By the way, I'm Richard.

88
00:6:16,600-->00:6:17,600
What's your name?

89
00:6:17,600-->00:6:18,600
Alexandra.

90
00:6:18,600-->00:6:20,600
Bye-bye, Alexandra. Thanks.

91
00:6:20,600-->00:6:22,600
Bye-bye.

92
00:6:22,600-->00:6:26,600
Richard! Richard!

93
00:6:26,600-->00:6:28,600
You left your bag!
