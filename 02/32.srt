1
00:0:47,600-->00:0:50,600
I remember your parents' first house very well.

2
00:0:50,600-->00:0:54,600
It was on Spring Avenue, near the park.

3
00:0:54,600-->00:0:55,600
I grew up in that house.

4
00:0:55,600-->00:0:58,000
Yes, and you were such a cute baby.

5
00:0:58,000-->00:0:59,000
I've seen pictures of him.

6
00:0:59,000-->00:1:1,000
He had blond hair.

7
00:1:1,000-->00:1:4,000
I've been friendly with the Stewart family

8
00:1:4,000-->00:1:5,000
for a long time,

9
00:1:5,000-->00:1:6,000
so it's my pleasure

10
00:1:6,600-->00:1:7,600
to help you find a house now.

11
00:1:7,600-->00:1:9,600
Well, we're not sure we can afford one.

12
00:1:9,600-->00:1:10,600
But we'd like to find out

13
00:1:10,600-->00:1:11,600
about the possibilities.

14
00:1:11,600-->00:1:12,600
That's a good idea.

15
00:1:12,600-->00:1:15,600
I love your house on Linden Street.

16
00:1:15,600-->00:1:19,600
I sold your father that house seventeen years ago.

17
00:1:19,600-->00:1:20,600
Really?

18
00:1:20,600-->00:1:22,600
Yes, Mom was pregnant with Robbie then,

19
00:1:22,600-->00:1:23,600
and they needed the extra room.

20
00:1:23,600-->00:1:26,600
I hear you're expecting a baby, Mrs. Stewart.

21
00:1:26,600-->00:1:27,600
Mmm-hmm.

22
00:1:27,600-->00:1:28,600
So we will be needing more room.

23
00:1:28,600-->00:1:30,600
Oh, so you don't need something immediately?

24
00:1:30,600-->00:1:33,600
No. But in five or six months...

25
00:1:33,600-->00:1:35,600
And time passes so quickly.

26
00:1:35,600-->00:1:36,600
Yes, it does.

27
00:1:36,600-->00:1:39,600
Well, when you called,

28
00:1:39,600-->00:1:41,600
you gave me enough information

29
00:1:41,600-->00:1:42,600
about your salaries and your savings.

30
00:1:42,600-->00:1:44,600
So I have a good idea about your financial situation.

31
00:1:44,600-->00:1:47,600
Let me show you some pictures of houses.

32
00:1:47,600-->00:1:48,600
With two bedrooms?

33
00:1:48,600-->00:1:51,600
Yes, I think I can show you some.

34
00:1:51,600-->00:1:53,600
Of course, they won't be in Riverdale.

35
00:1:53,600-->00:1:55,600
The cost of housing's too high for you here.

36
00:1:55,600-->00:1:58,600
I haven't thought about living anywhere else.

37
00:1:58,600-->00:2:1,600
We've always lived in this area.

38
00:2:1,600-->00:2:4,600
Where should we look for a house, Mrs. Martinelli?

39
00:2:4,600-->00:2:6,600
Well, we have an office in Mount Kisco.

40
00:2:6,600-->00:2:7,600
It's a lovely area,

41
00:2:7,600-->00:2:9,600
and it's only about an hour's drive from here.

42
00:2:9,600-->00:2:10,600
Here.

43
00:2:10,600-->00:2:14,600
I have a book with photos of some homes in that area.

44
00:2:14,600-->00:2:18,600
Now, let's see.

45
00:2:18,600-->00:2:21,600
Here

46
00:2:21,600-->00:2:26,600
This is a lovely two-bedroom house in your price range.

47
00:2:26,600-->00:2:29,600
It's pretty,

48
00:2:29,600-->00:2:31,600
but I prefer a two-story home.

49
00:2:31,600-->00:2:32,600
I do, too.

50
00:2:32,600-->00:2:33,600
I don't care for a ranch type.

51
00:2:33,600-->00:2:35,600
OK.

52
00:2:35,600-->00:2:40,600
Oh, this is a wonderful house.

53
00:2:40,600-->00:2:42,600
I know it well.

54
00:2:42,600-->00:2:43,600
I sold it to the present owners.

55
00:2:43,600-->00:2:44,600
It looks wonderful.

56
00:2:44,600-->00:2:47,600
This is a two-bedroom, two-bath house.

57
00:2:47,600-->00:2:48,600
It has a full basement,

58
00:2:48,600-->00:2:50,600
and it is on a half-acre lot.

59
00:2:50,600-->00:2:52,600
You can probably afford this one.

60
00:2:52,600-->00:2:54,600
I like this house.

61
00:2:54,600-->00:2:55,600
So do I.

62
00:2:55,600-->00:2:57,600
And the price is right.

63
00:2:57,600-->00:2:59,600
Would you like to go see it?

64
00:2:59,600-->00:3:0,600
Yes. We're planning

65
00:3:0,600-->00:3:2,600
to talk to someone at the bank next week.

66
00:3:2,600-->00:3:4,600
Perhaps we could see the house this weekend.

67
00:3:4,600-->00:3:7,600
If someone doesn't buy it before then,

68
00:3:7,600-->00:3:10,600
But let's keep looking.

69
00:3:10,600-->00:3:13,600
Just to get an idea of some other possibilities.

70
00:3:13,600-->00:3:15,600
This is very helpful, Mrs. Martinelli.

71
00:3:15,600-->00:3:17,600
Here.

72
00:3:17,600-->00:3:21,600
This is a wonderful example of Spanish-style architecture.

73
00:3:21,600-->00:3:25,600
I love the roof tiles on a Spanish-style house.

74
00:3:25,600-->00:3:28,600
It looks like the houses in Hollywood.

75
00:3:28,600-->00:3:29,600
It's interesting.

76
00:3:29,600-->00:3:34,600
A house like this in Riverdale costs double the price.

77
00:3:34,600-->00:3:44,600
Oh my!

78
00:3:44,600-->00:3:48,600
Here's a real buy.

79
00:3:48,600-->00:3:50,600
It's a bargain.

80
00:3:50,600-->00:3:52,600
This house just came on the market.

81
00:3:52,600-->00:3:53,600
It's quite lovely.

82
00:3:53,600-->00:3:54,600
Is it a two-bedroom house?

83
00:3:54,600-->00:3:58,600
No. It has three bedrooms and three baths.

84
00:3:58,600-->00:3:59,600
I know the house.

85
00:3:59,600-->00:4:1,600
It has a brand new kitchen.

86
00:4:1,600-->00:4:3,600
And a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling.

87
00:4:3,600-->00:4:6,600
And there's a two-car garage.

88
00:4:6,600-->00:4:7,600
Then why don't we go look at this house, too?

89
00:4:7,600-->00:4:9,600
It's a good investment.

90
00:4:9,600-->00:4:11,600
Thank you, Mrs. Martinelli.

91
00:4:11,600-->00:4:12,600
Thanks so much.

92
00:4:12,600-->00:4:13,600
My pleasure.

93
00:4:13,600-->00:4:16,600
Give my best to your parents.

94
00:4:16,600-->00:4:19,600
Your father's a wonderful doctor, Richard.

95
00:4:19,600-->00:4:20,600
He took care of my daughter

96
00:4:20,600-->00:4:21,600
when she was a child.

97
00:4:21,600-->00:4:24,600
He's the best pediatrician in Westchester.

98
00:4:24,600-->00:4:25,600
Thanks, Mrs. Martinelli.

99
00:4:25,600-->00:4:26,600
I'll give them your regards.

100
00:4:26,600-->00:4:28,600
We really appreciate your advice.

101
00:4:28,600-->00:4:30,600
I do think you should go see the houses

102
00:4:30,600-->00:4:32,600
and talk to the bank.

103
00:4:32,600-->00:4:33,600
Here.

104
00:4:33,600-->00:4:35,600
Let me give you some information sheets about the houses.

105
00:4:35,600-->00:4:42,600
They're both very good buys.

106
00:4:42,600-->00:4:45,600
Well, thanks so much for your help and your time,

107
00:4:45,600-->00:4:46,600
Mrs. Martinelli.

108
00:4:46,600-->00:4:48,600
We've got a lot to talk about.

109
00:4:48,600-->00:4:50,600
Mmm-hmm. Thanks.
