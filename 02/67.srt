1
00:1:54,600-->00:1:59,600
Morning, Grandpa.

2
00:1:59,600-->00:2:3,600
Is something the matter, Grandpa?

3
00:2:3,600-->00:2:14,600
The editorial in this paper has my friend Nat Baker real upset.

4
00:2:14,600-->00:2:17,600
Ah! I'll read it to you.

5
00:2:17,600-->00:2:22,600
"The old library building on Chestnut Street,

6
00:2:22,600-->00:2:25,600
which has been vacant for over a year now,

7
00:2:25,600-->00:2:28,600
was supposed to be made into a community center

8
00:2:28,600-->00:2:30,600
to serve the senior citizens

9
00:2:30,600-->00:2:32,600
as well as the younger people of Riverdale.

10
00:2:32,600-->00:2:34,600
Due to lack of funds

11
00:2:34,600-->00:2:37,600
for the repainting of the interior of the building

12
00:2:37,600-->00:2:39,600
and for the furniture needed,

13
00:2:39,600-->00:2:42,600
the plans for the community center

14
00:2:42,600-->00:2:45,600
have been postponed indefinitely."

15
00:2:45,600-->00:2:49,600
He's coming over to talk about it.

16
00:2:49,600-->00:2:51,600
Is it that serious a problem, Grandpa?

17
00:2:51,600-->00:2:53,600
It is.

18
00:2:53,600-->00:2:57,600
Nat's not as lucky as I am, Robbie. Nat

19
00:2:57,600-->00:2:59,600
He doesn't have any family with him.

20
00:2:59,600-->00:3:1,600
He lives alone

21
00:3:1,600-->00:3:5,600
and depends on places like a community center

22
00:3:5,600-->00:3:8,600
to be with people--people his own age.

23
00:3:8,600-->00:3:12,600
But there's the old community center on Elm Street.

24
00:3:12,600-->00:3:13,600
It's small,

25
00:3:13,600-->00:3:20,600
and the problem is that it's set up primarily for kids to play.

26
00:3:20,600-->00:3:26,600
Ping-Pong tables, soda machines, and lots of music.

27
00:3:26,600-->00:3:29,600
It's too noisy for some older people like Nat.

28
00:3:29,600-->00:3:32,600
I never realized that.

29
00:3:32,600-->00:3:36,600
It's hard for some older people to take all that noise.

30
00:3:36,600-->00:3:40,600
That's why the new community center is a good idea.

31
00:3:40,600-->00:3:42,600
Part of the building for older people,

32
00:3:42,600-->00:3:44,600
part of the building for younger people.

33
00:3:44,600-->00:3:46,600
I see what you mean.

34
00:3:46,600-->00:3:49,600
That must be Nat.

35
00:3:49,600-->00:3:51,600
It could be Alexandra.

36
00:3:51,600-->00:3:54,600
She's coming over this morning to help me with my math.

37
00:3:54,600-->00:4:2,600
Hi, Robbie.

38
00:4:2,600-->00:4:4,600
Hi, Alexandra. Come on in.

39
00:4:4,600-->00:4:9,600
Do you want something cold to drink?

40
00:4:9,600-->00:4:11,600
I'd love some cola, please.

41
00:4:11,600-->00:4:13,600
Cola coming up.

42
00:4:13,600-->00:4:17,600
I really appreciate you coming over to help me with my math.

43
00:4:17,600-->00:4:19,600
My final exam is next Tuesday.

44
00:4:19,600-->00:4:22,600
You're so good in all your other subjects.

45
00:4:22,600-->00:4:24,600
I just can't understand

46
00:4:24,600-->00:4:26,600
why you have so many problems with math.

47
00:4:26,600-->00:4:28,600
Hi, Alexandra.

48
00:4:28,600-->00:4:29,600
Hi, Mr. Stewart.

49
00:4:29,600-->00:4:32,600
I thought that was Nat Baker who rang the front doorbell.

50
00:4:32,600-->00:4:35,600
Don't let me interrupt you.

51
00:4:35,600-->00:4:36,600
No problem, Grandpa.

52
00:4:36,600-->00:4:37,600
We're just having some cola

53
00:4:37,600-->00:4:40,600
before getting to the tough stuff--math.

54
00:4:40,600-->00:4:44,600
He'll do anything to avoid getting down to math lessons,

55
00:4:44,600-->00:4:45,600
Mr. Stewart. Stewart

56
00:4:45,600-->00:4:48,600
I was the same way.

57
00:4:48,600-->00:4:49,600
Really, Grandpa?

58
00:4:49,600-->00:4:52,600
Really. I didn't like math.

59
00:4:52,600-->00:4:56,600
I wasn't good at it, and I didn't like studying it.

60
00:4:56,600-->00:4:58,600
But you had to be good at math.

61
00:4:58,600-->00:5:0,600
You graduated from engineering school.

62
00:5:0,600-->00:5:3,600
I was. But not in high school.

63
00:5:3,600-->00:5:6,600
For some reason, I couldn't get a handle on it.

64
00:5:6,600-->00:5:10,600
Then, in college, I became good at it.

65
00:5:10,600-->00:5:12,600
Then there's hope for Robbie.

66
00:5:12,600-->00:5:13,600
I can't wait.

67
00:5:13,600-->00:5:17,600
You think I can just skip it now and get to it at college?

68
00:5:17,600-->00:5:20,600
You'll never get to college to find out, Robbie,

69
00:5:20,600-->00:5:21,600
if you skip it now.

70
00:5:21,600-->00:5:24,600
That must be Nat.

71
00:5:24,600-->00:5:29,600
Sit down, Robbie. Let's get to work.

72
00:5:29,600-->00:5:43,600
I'd like you to meet my friend Nat Baker.

73
00:5:43,600-->00:5:47,600
This is Alexandra Pappas, and this is my grandson Robbie,

74
00:5:47,600-->00:5:49,600
whom I think you've met once or twice before.

75
00:5:49,600-->00:5:51,600
Nice to meet you, Mr. Baker.

76
00:5:51,600-->00:5:53,600
Hi, Mr. Baker. We met before.

77
00:5:53,600-->00:5:54,600
Where?

78
00:5:54,600-->00:5:57,600
In town. At the hardware store.

79
00:5:57,600-->00:6:2,600
I remember now. Right. Hi.

80
00:6:2,600-->00:6:3,600
Hello, Alexandra.

81
00:6:3,600-->00:6:7,600
Don't let us keep you from your math tutoring, Robbie.

82
00:6:7,600-->00:6:9,600
I know you want to get to it.

83
00:6:9,600-->00:6:10,600
Stay ... stay.

84
00:6:10,600-->00:6:14,600
I told you. He'll use any excuse to avoid math.

85
00:6:14,600-->00:6:17,600
Did you read the story in the paper, Malcolm?

86
00:6:17,600-->00:6:18,600
I did.

87
00:6:18,600-->00:6:21,600
It's a serious matter for a lot of us.

88
00:6:21,600-->00:6:22,600
A serious matter.

89
00:6:22,600-->00:6:24,600
It is. Come on out to the patio.

90
00:6:24,600-->00:6:25,600
We'll talk about it out there.

91
00:6:25,600-->00:6:28,600
Thanks. Nice to meet you ... again.

92
00:6:28,600-->00:6:32,600
What's the problem?

93
00:6:32,600-->00:6:35,600
Come on! You'll hear about it.
