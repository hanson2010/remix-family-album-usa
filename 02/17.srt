00:0:27,600-->00:0:32,600
I love parades.

2
00:0:32,600-->00:0:36,600
The Thanksgiving Day parade is always such great fun.

3
00:0:36,600-->00:0:41,600
Look at that Superman balloon!

4
00:0:41,600-->00:0:48,600
Wowee! Just floating along high above Central Park West.

5
00:0:48,600-->00:0:51,600
Don't you just love it?

6
00:0:51,600-->00:0:53,600
Oh, and the bands and the music.

7
00:0:53,600-->00:0:54,600
John Philip Sousa. John Philip Soussa

8
00:0:54,600-->00:0:56,600
I love his music.

9
00:0:56,600-->00:1:3,600
Da dada da da dada da da da da da da dada.

10
00:1:3,600-->00:1:6,600
Oh, look at that float, Robbie.

11
00:1:6,600-->00:1:9,600
Look at those funny-looking clowns.

12
00:1:9,600-->00:1:11,600
It's for kids.

13
00:1:11,600-->00:1:15,600
Maybe so, but parades always make me feel like a kid.

14
00:1:15,600-->00:1:19,600
Remember when you and your dad and I

15
00:1:19,600-->00:1:21,600
went to the Thanksgiving Day parade?

16
00:1:21,600-->00:1:25,600
You were four or five years old, I think.

17
00:1:25,600-->00:1:35,600
Hello, hello.... Oh, hi, Susan.

18
00:1:35,600-->00:1:38,600
How are you?... Here's Mom.

19
00:1:38,600-->00:1:43,600
Hello, Susan.

20
00:1:43,600-->00:1:46,600
Yes, he missed a phone call from Alexandra.

21
00:1:46,600-->00:1:49,600
Yes, I know, but he'll get over it.

22
00:1:49,600-->00:1:52,600
Good. Then you'll be here about five?

23
00:1:52,600-->00:1:53,600
Oh, fine.

24
00:1:53,600-->00:1:57,600
I look forward to seeing you and Harry and Michelle.

25
00:1:57,600-->00:1:59,600
Drive carefully.

26
00:1:59,600-->00:2:0,600
Good-bye.

27
00:2:0,600-->00:2:2,600
Taste Ellen's turkey dressing.

28
00:2:2,600-->00:2:4,600
It's delicious.

29
00:2:4,600-->00:2:6,600
I'm not surprised.

30
00:2:6,600-->00:2:8,600
It's Grandma's recipe.

31
00:2:8,600-->00:2:10,600
It's my favorite part of the meal.

32
00:2:10,600-->00:2:11,600
What about my famous apple pie?

33
00:2:11,600-->00:2:15,600
Dad, your apple pie is my favorite dessert.

34
00:2:15,600-->00:2:16,600
How's the parade?

35
00:2:16,600-->00:2:17,600
OK.

36
00:2:17,600-->00:2:30,600
Mom! Is it for me?

37
00:2:30,600-->00:2:31,600
No, Robbie.

38
00:2:31,600-->00:2:33,600
Who was it?

39
00:2:33,600-->00:2:36,600
Wrong number.

40
00:2:36,600-->00:2:39,600
Philip, would you join me in the kitchen, please? Philip

41
00:2:39,600-->00:2:40,600
It's getting late.

42
00:2:40,600-->00:2:41,600
We have vegetables to prepare.

43
00:2:41,600-->00:2:42,600
Can I help with anything?

44
00:2:42,600-->00:2:43,600
No, honey.

45
00:2:43,600-->00:2:45,600
You just relax with Grandpa.

46
00:2:45,600-->00:2:46,600
I'll get you to help serve later.

47
00:2:46,600-->00:2:50,600
Ellen reminds me so much of Grandma. Ellen

48
00:2:50,600-->00:2:52,600
What time does the Michigan football game come on? Michigan

49
00:2:52,600-->00:2:53,600
Four.

50
00:2:53,600-->00:2:54,600
Philip! Philip

51
00:2:54,600-->00:2:56,600
I'll be back to see the game.

52
00:2:56,600-->00:3:2,600
Grandpa, when did Dad graduate from Michigan?

53
00:3:2,600-->00:3:4,600
Let me think.

54
00:3:4,600-->00:3:9,600
He graduated from medical school in 1960

55
00:3:9,600-->00:3:12,600
and from the University of Michigan in 1956.

56
00:3:12,600-->00:3:15,600
Did you go to Michigan, too, Grandpa?

57
00:3:15,600-->00:3:19,600
Yup. I graduated in 1937.

58
00:3:19,600-->00:3:27,600
I've got to start thinking about college soon.
