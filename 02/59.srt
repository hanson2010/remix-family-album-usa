00:1:21,600-->00:1:24,600
Hello there, Robbie.

2
00:1:24,600-->00:1:26,600
What are you doing up this late?

3
00:1:26,600-->00:1:28,600
Reading.

4
00:1:28,600-->00:1:29,600
Reading?

5
00:1:29,600-->00:1:30,600
At this hour?

6
00:1:30,600-->00:1:31,600
Ah, come on, Robbie.

7
00:1:31,600-->00:1:32,600
What are you doing up this late?

8
00:1:32,600-->00:1:35,600
Things on my mind.

9
00:1:35,600-->00:1:39,600
Do you care to talk about them?

10
00:1:39,600-->00:1:41,600
Sure,

11
00:1:41,600-->00:1:43,600
if you don't mind listening.

12
00:1:43,600-->00:1:46,600
Robbie, Robbie, remember me?

13
00:1:46,600-->00:1:48,600
I'm your mother.

14
00:1:48,600-->00:1:51,600
If you have something you want to talk about,

15
00:1:51,600-->00:1:52,600
I'm always prepared to listen.

16
00:1:52,600-->00:1:56,600
You haven't been around much lately.

17
00:1:56,600-->00:1:59,600
So that's it.

18
00:1:59,600-->00:2:1,600
OK, let's talk.

19
00:2:1,600-->00:2:5,600
You and Dad are like ships that pass in the night.

20
00:2:5,600-->00:2:8,600
Dad works hard, and he works late.

21
00:2:8,600-->00:2:10,600
You work hard on all your committees,

22
00:2:10,600-->00:2:12,600
and you work late.

23
00:2:12,600-->00:2:14,600
I thought you were proud of the work I do.

24
00:2:14,600-->00:2:15,600
I am, Mom.

25
00:2:15,600-->00:2:16,600
Real proud.

26
00:2:16,600-->00:2:20,600
You are one fantastic mom,

27
00:2:20,600-->00:2:24,600
but ... but I've been noticing

28
00:2:24,600-->00:2:26,600
how little quality time

29
00:2:26,600-->00:2:29,600
you spend with Dad and me... and the family.

30
00:2:29,600-->00:2:35,600
It's a real problem, Robbie.

31
00:2:35,600-->00:2:37,600
I know it.

32
00:2:37,600-->00:2:42,600
I'm concerned.

33
00:2:42,600-->00:2:44,600
There must be a way

34
00:2:44,600-->00:2:47,600
that Dad and you can spend more time together.

35
00:2:47,600-->00:2:51,600
Well, we always talk about

36
00:2:51,600-->00:2:53,600
taking a vacation together with the family.

37
00:2:53,600-->00:2:56,600
I think you ought to

38
00:2:56,600-->00:2:59,600
take a vacation away from the family, alone.

39
00:2:59,600-->00:3:1,600
Kind of a second honeymoon.

40
00:3:1,600-->00:3:4,600
It would be wonderful,

41
00:3:4,600-->00:3:6,600
but our schedules won't allow it.

42
00:3:6,600-->00:3:8,600
I think I have an idea.

43
00:3:8,600-->00:3:10,600
You do?

44
00:3:10,600-->00:3:11,600
Yup.

45
00:3:11,600-->00:3:13,600
I think I have an idea

46
00:3:13,600-->00:3:14,600
that will bring Dad and you

47
00:3:14,600-->00:3:16,600
together in a more scheduled way.

48
00:3:16,600-->00:3:18,600
What is it?

49
00:3:18,600-->00:3:19,600
Well,

50
00:3:19,600-->00:3:21,600
you know how Dad is always talking about

51
00:3:21,600-->00:3:22,600
the kids in the ward

52
00:3:22,600-->00:3:25,600
and how important it is for them to be paid attention to?

53
00:3:25,600-->00:3:26,600
Yes.

54
00:3:26,600-->00:3:27,600
Well...

55
00:3:27,600-->00:3:28,600
and how hard it is

56
00:3:28,600-->00:3:30,600
because the doctors and nurses are so busy?

57
00:3:30,600-->00:3:31,600
Yes.

58
00:3:31,600-->00:3:36,600
Well, how would it be if you took some time

59
00:3:36,600-->00:3:38,600
to work with Dad towards solving that problem?

60
00:3:38,600-->00:3:40,600
I don't get it.

61
00:3:40,600-->00:3:44,600
Like setting up a regular weekly reading program.

62
00:3:44,600-->00:3:46,600
You and Dad.

63
00:3:46,600-->00:3:48,600
You and Dr. Philip Stewart--

64
00:3:48,600-->00:3:51,600
going to the children's ward once or twice a week

65
00:3:51,600-->00:3:52,600
and reading to them.

66
00:3:52,600-->00:3:55,600
Not bad.

67
00:3:55,600-->00:3:57,600
Not a bad idea, Robbie.

68
00:3:57,600-->00:3:59,600
As a matter of fact,

69
00:3:59,600-->00:4:1,600
it fits right in with something I'm working on right now

70
00:4:1,600-->00:4:3,600
with the school-board committee.

71
00:4:3,600-->00:4:4,600
What's that?

72
00:4:4,600-->00:4:6,600
I've been trying

73
00:4:6,600-->00:4:8,600
to work out a program

74
00:4:8,600-->00:4:9,600
in the public school

75
00:4:9,600-->00:4:13,600
that will bring parents and teachers together once a week

76
00:4:13,600-->00:4:16,600
to read to the students - their own children, really.

77
00:4:16,600-->00:4:18,600
By doing that, it will encourage reading.

78
00:4:18,600-->00:4:21,600
So it might fit in with a program

79
00:4:21,600-->00:4:23,600
for reading to the kids in the hospital.

80
00:4:23,600-->00:4:24,600
You're right.

81
00:4:24,600-->00:4:26,600
We'll do it!

82
00:4:26,600-->00:4:28,600
I'm going to talk to Daddy about it right now.

83
00:4:28,600-->00:4:32,600
But Dad was so exhausted when he came home from work.

84
00:4:32,600-->00:4:34,600
Why don't you talk to him about it tomorrow?

85
00:4:34,600-->00:4:38,600
You are a very smart young man, Robbie.

86
00:4:38,600-->00:4:41,600
I think I'll wait until tomorrow.

87
00:4:41,600-->00:4:43,600
You won't forget, will you?

88
00:4:43,600-->00:4:45,600
Believe me, I won't.

89
00:4:45,600-->00:4:47,600
It is a great idea,

90
00:4:47,600-->00:4:49,600
and I promise you I won't forget.

91
00:4:49,600-->00:4:51,600
Thanks, Mom.

92
00:4:51,600-->00:4:52,600
Thank you, Robbie.
