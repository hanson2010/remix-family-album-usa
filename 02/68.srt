00:0:57,600-->00:0:59,600
There is a way, Malcolm.

2
00:0:59,600-->00:1:3,600
We get our friends to roll their sleeves up and get to work.

3
00:1:3,600-->00:1:5,600
It's certainly a good idea.

4
00:1:5,600-->00:1:7,600
If I could take a look at the place,

5
00:1:7,600-->00:1:11,600
I could probably tell what it requires to fix it up.

6
00:1:11,600-->00:1:15,600
How much paint, how many hours of work ...

7
00:1:15,600-->00:1:19,600
That's what I came to ask you to do, Malcolm.

8
00:1:19,600-->00:1:22,600
If you would supervise the refurbishing,

9
00:1:22,600-->00:1:25,600
I'll find the people to help do it.

10
00:1:25,600-->00:1:27,600
I'll help too, Mr. Baker.

11
00:1:27,600-->00:1:30,600
I can get some of my friends to go around the neighborhood

12
00:1:30,600-->00:1:32,600
and collect the furniture we need.

13
00:1:32,600-->00:1:34,600
I'll help.

14
00:1:34,600-->00:1:38,600
Tomorrow. Yes. We'll meet tomorrow morning, right here.

15
00:1:38,600-->00:1:39,600
Can we help?

16
00:1:39,600-->00:1:40,600
I'd really like to.

17
00:1:40,600-->00:1:41,600
Sure.

18
00:1:41,600-->00:1:44,600
We might need you to come through with your friends, Robbie.

19
00:1:44,600-->00:1:47,600
Not just to go around the neighborhood asking for furniture,

20
00:1:47,600-->00:1:49,600
but to help with the paint job.

21
00:1:49,600-->00:1:52,600
That's backbreaking work and may be too much for us.

22
00:1:52,600-->00:1:55,600
I'll do it. I'll talk to them.

23
00:1:55,600-->00:1:59,600
And tomorrow morning we'll all meet here to discuss the plan?

24
00:1:59,600-->00:2:1,600
Tomorrow morning it is.

25
00:2:1,600-->00:2:18,600

26
00:2:18,600-->00:2:26,600
Come in, come in. Please, come in.

27
00:2:26,600-->00:2:36,600
I'd like you to meet my friend Malcolm Stewart.

28
00:2:36,600-->00:2:38,600
Malcolm, this is Joanne Thompson. Malcolm

29
00:2:38,600-->00:2:41,600
Hello, Joanne. Nice to meet you.

30
00:2:41,600-->00:2:42,600
My pleasure, Malcolm.

31
00:2:42,600-->00:2:46,600
And this is Abe Lucas. You must remember Abe.

32
00:2:46,600-->00:2:47,600
He ran the drugstore

33
00:2:47,600-->00:2:50,600
and used to play drums with the jazz band on weekends.

34
00:2:50,600-->00:2:52,600
Oh, sure I do. Hi, Abe.

35
00:2:52,600-->00:2:53,600
Hello, Mr. Stewart.

36
00:2:53,600-->00:2:54,600
Malcolm, please.

37
00:2:54,600-->00:2:55,600
Hello, Malcolm.

38
00:2:55,600-->00:2:57,600
Sit down, sit down. Have some coffee.

39
00:2:57,600-->00:3:1,600
And I've got some delicious Danish pastry for you.

40
00:3:1,600-->00:3:4,600
Where's your grandson Robbie and his friend Alexandra?

41
00:3:4,600-->00:3:6,600
Weren't they going to be here this morning?

42
00:3:6,600-->00:3:8,600
I thought so, too.

43
00:3:8,600-->00:3:12,600
I'm surprised they're not here.

44
00:3:12,600-->00:3:16,600
Robbie left early this morning to meet Alexandra. Robbie

45
00:3:16,600-->00:3:20,600
Frankly, I thought they'd be here, but ...

46
00:3:20,600-->00:3:23,600
It's OK. I'm sure they meant well,

47
00:3:23,600-->00:3:25,600
but they probably had other things on their minds.

48
00:3:25,600-->00:3:29,600
I understand you used to be in the construction business,

49
00:3:29,600-->00:3:30,600
Malcolm. Malcolm

50
00:3:30,600-->00:3:31,600
I was, indeed.

51
00:3:31,600-->00:3:34,600
I wonder if you would take a look at the old library

52
00:3:34,600-->00:3:37,600
and make sure that it is in good condition

53
00:3:37,600-->00:3:40,600
so that we don't have to worry about any structural problems.

54
00:3:40,600-->00:3:44,600
When can I do that? I'd be happy to.

55
00:3:44,600-->00:3:46,600
We've got permission to go inside the old building

56
00:3:46,600-->00:3:48,600
during the week--

57
00:3:48,600-->00:3:50,600
Tuesday or Wednesday.

58
00:3:50,600-->00:3:53,600
That's fine with me. I can do it either day.

59
00:3:53,600-->00:3:55,600
That would be very helpful.

60
00:3:55,600-->00:3:58,600
I think the building just needs a good cleaning.

61
00:3:58,600-->00:4:0,600
And a good paint job.

62
00:4:0,600-->00:4:2,600
Then we have to furnish it.

63
00:4:2,600-->00:4:6,600
I wish Robbie and Alexandra had come to this meeting.

64
00:4:6,600-->00:4:9,600
They had some ideas about getting the place fixed up.

65
00:4:9,600-->00:4:12,600
Perhaps they'll show up. In the meantime,

66
00:4:12,600-->00:4:16,600
let me give you some additional thoughts and ideas I have.

67
00:4:16,600-->00:4:17,600
OK.

68
00:4:17,600-->00:4:20,600
Go ahead, Joanne.

69
00:4:20,600-->00:4:25,600
As I said, mostly the building just needs a good cleaning.

70
00:4:25,600-->00:4:28,600
This place can be developed

71
00:4:28,600-->00:4:32,600
with one real intergenerational program.

72
00:4:32,600-->00:4:34,600
That's an idea I like.

73
00:4:34,600-->00:4:35,600
A community center

74
00:4:35,600-->00:4:38,600
with the kinds of programs that fit everyone.

75
00:4:38,600-->00:4:41,600
And programs that don't leave anyone out.

76
00:4:41,600-->00:4:43,600
It's asking a lot.

77
00:4:43,600-->00:4:46,600
But we can't do it without talking to the young people.

78
00:4:46,600-->00:4:48,600
Finding out what they want.

79
00:4:48,600-->00:4:51,600
If only Robbie and Alexandra were here.

80
00:4:51,600-->00:4:53,600
Don't be upset, Malcolm.

81
00:4:53,600-->00:4:55,600
We'll have a chance to talk to them later.

82
00:4:55,600-->00:4:57,600
It's not like Robbie.

83
00:4:57,600-->00:5:0,600
If he says he's going to be here, he's here.

84
00:5:0,600-->00:5:4,600
I wonder what the problem is.
