1
00:0:46,600-->00:0:49,600
And now for ... something old,

2
00:0:49,600-->00:0:50,600
something new, something borrowed,

3
00:0:50,600-->00:0:51,600
and something blue.

4
00:0:51,600-->00:0:54,600
OK. Let's see.

5
00:0:54,600-->00:0:55,600
Something borrowed.

6
00:0:55,600-->00:0:59,600
That's this dress. Borrowed from Marilyn.

7
00:0:59,600-->00:1:5,600
Something blue.

8
00:1:5,600-->00:1:9,600
My wristband.

9
00:1:9,600-->00:1:14,600
I wore it when I married your father.

10
00:1:14,600-->00:1:22,600
Oh, Mother. I forgot you still had it.

11
00:1:22,600-->00:1:25,600
It's just so lovely.

12
00:1:25,600-->00:1:26,600
I bought it in an antique shop

13
00:1:26,600-->00:1:28,600
when I was about eighteen years old.

14
00:1:28,600-->00:1:31,600
I saved it for my wedding day.

15
00:1:31,600-->00:1:35,600
And you saved it for me, didn't you, Mother?

16
00:1:35,600-->00:1:40,600
Yes, honey. I did.

17
00:1:40,600-->00:1:43,600
Are we ever going to finish?

18
00:1:43,600-->00:1:53,600
All right. OK.

19
00:1:53,600-->00:1:55,600
Something borrowed.

20
00:1:55,600-->00:1:57,600
The wedding dress. And something blue.

21
00:1:57,600-->00:1:59,600
The wristband. Something old?

22
00:1:59,600-->00:2:2,600
Something old.

23
00:2:2,600-->00:2:4,600
Right. What's old?

24
00:2:4,600-->00:2:5,600
Of course!

25
00:2:5,600-->00:2:6,600
Something old.

26
00:2:6,600-->00:2:8,600
I had planned to wear them.

27
00:2:8,600-->00:2:20,600
Grandma's pearls!

28
00:2:20,600-->00:2:23,600
Oh, Grandpa will be so pleased that you're wearing them.

29
00:2:23,600-->00:2:27,600
I'm sure he misses Grandma on a day like this.

30
00:2:27,600-->00:2:29,600
Help me with them, Marilyn.

31
00:2:29,600-->00:2:33,600
I've never worn them before.

32
00:2:33,600-->00:2:35,600
I've been saving them for today.

33
00:2:35,600-->00:2:37,600
Saving them for today?

34
00:2:37,600-->00:2:40,600
Oh, you're a real Stewart!

35
00:2:40,600-->00:2:48,600
Oh, there you go.

36
00:2:48,600-->00:2:51,600
Lovely!

37
00:2:51,600-->00:2:53,600
Lovely!

38
00:2:53,600-->00:2:57,600
Lovely!

39
00:2:57,600-->00:3:2,600
Something borrowed, something blue.

40
00:3:2,600-->00:3:3,600
Something old ...

41
00:3:3,600-->00:3:6,600
and now for something new.

42
00:3:6,600-->00:3:7,600
The veil.

43
00:3:7,600-->00:3:9,600
Oh, it's so beautiful, Marilyn!

44
00:3:9,600-->00:3:14,600
You really are a fabulous designer, Marilyn.

45
00:3:14,600-->00:3:32,600
Doesn't it look just right on Susan? Susan

46
00:3:32,600-->00:3:34,600
Perfect!

47
00:3:34,600-->00:3:36,600
And when you both say, "I do,"

48
00:3:36,600-->00:3:41,600
Harry will lift this veil over your head Harry

49
00:3:41,600-->00:3:44,600
and kiss the bride.

50
00:3:44,600-->00:3:48,600
Oh, I'm so excited!

51
00:3:48,600-->00:3:50,600
When you said, "I do," Marilyn,

52
00:3:50,600-->00:3:53,600
it suddenly became real.

53
00:3:53,600-->00:3:55,600
That's all right, Susan.

54
00:3:55,600-->00:3:57,600
You've got the wedding-day jitters!

55
00:3:57,600-->00:4:1,600
In less than two hours,

56
00:4:1,600-->00:4:4,600
you will be Mrs. Harry Bennett.

57
00:4:4,600-->00:4:7,600
Oh, that reminds me.

58
00:4:7,600-->00:4:8,600
If we don't get dressed,

59
00:4:8,600-->00:4:10,600
we won't be there

60
00:4:10,600-->00:4:14,600
to see Susan become Mrs. Harry Bennett.

61
00:4:14,600-->00:4:17,600
Before you leave--do I look all right?

62
00:4:17,600-->00:4:21,600
You never looked better.

63
00:4:21,600-->00:4:23,600
Mom.

64
00:4:23,600-->00:4:26,600
She's right.

65
00:4:26,600-->00:4:30,600
And that's dear little Max.

66
00:4:30,600-->00:4:33,600
Got to go and feed him.

67
00:4:33,600-->00:4:37,600
What am I supposed to do?

68
00:4:37,600-->00:4:38,600
Take off the veil,

69
00:4:38,600-->00:4:40,600
kick off your shoes, and sit down.

70
00:4:40,600-->00:4:43,600
We'll come upstairs and get you in a little while.

71
00:4:43,600-->00:4:46,600
Richard's going to take some wedding pictures Richard

72
00:4:46,600-->00:4:47,600
before the ceremony.

73
00:4:47,600-->00:4:48,600
So just relax.

74
00:4:48,600-->00:4:50,600
Are you kidding? Relax?

75
00:4:50,600-->00:5:14,600

76
00:5:14,600-->00:5:17,600
Susan Stewart ... Susan Stewart

77
00:5:17,600-->00:5:20,600
you are about to become Susan Bennett--

78
00:5:20,600-->00:5:29,600
Mrs. Harry Bennett. Harry Bennet
