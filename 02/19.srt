1
00:1:59,600-->00:2:2,600
Robbie, this new Walkman is absolutely wonderful.

2
00:2:2,600-->00:2:5,600
Richard and Marilyn bought it for me for my birthday.

3
00:2:5,600-->00:2:8,600
They're so thoughtful.

4
00:2:8,600-->00:2:12,600
You are very lucky, Robbie, to have such a nice family.

5
00:2:12,600-->00:2:15,600
Is something wrong, Alexandra?

6
00:2:15,600-->00:2:18,600
No, nothing.

7
00:2:18,600-->00:2:20,600
Yes, there is.

8
00:2:20,600-->00:2:21,600
I can tell.

9
00:2:21,600-->00:2:23,600
What's the matter?

10
00:2:23,600-->00:2:26,600
Come on, you can tell me.

11
00:2:26,600-->00:2:27,600
What's up?

12
00:2:27,600-->00:2:29,600
I don't know.

13
00:2:29,600-->00:2:32,600
Something's wrong.

14
00:2:32,600-->00:2:36,600
OK, let's talk.

15
00:2:36,600-->00:2:42,600
I received a letter from my parents this morning.

16
00:2:42,600-->00:2:45,600
Did they write some bad news?

17
00:2:45,600-->00:2:46,600
No.

18
00:2:46,600-->00:2:49,600
Well, then why are you so sad?

19
00:2:49,600-->00:2:51,600
I miss them.

20
00:2:51,600-->00:2:53,600
I miss them very much.

21
00:2:53,600-->00:2:55,600
I'm sorry, Alexandra.

22
00:2:55,600-->00:2:58,600
But I understand.

23
00:2:58,600-->00:3:3,600
The Molinas treat me so nicely, Molina

24
00:3:3,600-->00:3:7,600
and I love being with your family so much...

25
00:3:7,600-->00:3:11,600
but when I received the letter

26
00:3:11,600-->00:3:13,600
with photographs of my family, I cried.

27
00:3:13,600-->00:3:17,600
I cried because I miss them all.

28
00:3:17,600-->00:3:19,600
You really miss your family, don't you?

29
00:3:19,600-->00:3:24,600
Yes. I know I must seem silly.

30
00:3:24,600-->00:3:27,600
It's not like I have nobody.

31
00:3:27,600-->00:3:30,600
I like the Molinas very much,

32
00:3:30,600-->00:3:31,600
and they're so kind to me.

33
00:3:31,600-->00:3:38,600
Hey, why don't we go out

34
00:3:38,600-->00:3:40,600
for a cheeseburger and french fries?

35
00:3:40,600-->00:3:41,600
That'll cheer you up.

36
00:3:41,600-->00:3:44,600
And you can use my Walkman.

37
00:3:44,600-->00:3:47,600
That's a good idea.

38
00:3:47,600-->00:3:49,600
But if we go out,

39
00:3:49,600-->00:3:54,600
please don't complain

40
00:3:54,600-->00:3:56,600
about your math teacher or your math homework.

41
00:3:56,600-->00:3:58,600
I want to have fun.

42
00:3:58,600-->00:3:59,600
So do I.

43
00:3:59,600-->00:4:1,600
I have to turn off the lights,

44
00:4:1,600-->00:4:3,600
or else my father will get really angry.

45
00:4:3,600-->00:4:6,600
He says I never turn them out when I leave.

46
00:4:6,600-->00:4:8,600
If they come home and they're on...

47
00:4:8,600-->00:4:13,600
Do you hear something?

48
00:4:13,600-->00:4:14,600
Yes.

49
00:4:14,600-->00:4:15,600
What was that?

50
00:4:15,600-->00:4:19,600
It sounded like a dog barking.

51
00:4:19,600-->00:4:22,600
It sounded like a dog barking right here.

52
00:4:22,600-->00:4:23,600
Yeah.

53
00:4:23,600-->00:4:27,600
A dog!

54
00:4:27,600-->00:4:29,600
A springer spaniel!

55
00:4:29,600-->00:4:31,600
Come on in!

56
00:4:31,600-->00:4:33,600
Make yourself at home.

57
00:4:33,600-->00:4:36,600
Oh, you poor little thing.

58
00:4:36,600-->00:4:37,600
Come here.

59
00:4:37,600-->00:4:38,600
Come on.

60
00:4:38,600-->00:4:48,600
Poor baby.

61
00:4:48,600-->00:4:50,600
Where did you come from?

62
00:4:50,600-->00:4:56,600
Her name's Gemma,

63
00:4:56,600-->00:4:59,600
and she belongs to Mr. and Mrs. Levinson.

64
00:4:59,600-->00:5:1,600
There's a phone number

65
00:5:1,600-->00:5:5,600
555-8448.

66
00:5:5,600-->00:5:9,600
Robbie, maybe you should call them Robbie

67
00:5:9,600-->00:5:12,600
and tell the Levinsons we have their cute little spaniel.

68
00:5:12,600-->00:5:14,600
I've always wanted a springer spaniel.

69
00:5:14,600-->00:5:16,600
She's so cute.

70
00:5:16,600-->00:5:39,600
The number you are calling "555-8448"

71
00:5:39,600-->00:5:42,600
is no longer in service.

72
00:5:42,600-->00:5:46,600
The number's no longer in service.

73
00:5:46,600-->00:5:52,600
Oh, you poor, poor baby.

74
00:5:52,600-->00:5:53,600
You've lost your family.

75
00:5:53,600-->00:5:55,600
We'll find them.

76
00:5:55,600-->00:5:56,600
Don't worry, Alexandra.
