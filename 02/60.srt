1
00:0:56,600-->00:0:59,600
Good morning.

2
00:0:59,600-->00:1:1,600
What a wonderful morning!

3
00:1:1,600-->00:1:3,600
Don't the flowers smell wonderful?

4
00:1:3,600-->00:1:5,600
Good morning, Ellen.

5
00:1:5,600-->00:1:7,600
Yes, they do.

6
00:1:7,600-->00:1:10,600
That's why I'm reading my paper and having my coffee

7
00:1:10,600-->00:1:12,600
on the patio this morning.

8
00:1:12,600-->00:1:17,600
Ah, it does smell sweet.

9
00:1:17,600-->00:1:20,600
How was your school-board meeting last night?

10
00:1:20,600-->00:1:22,600
You must've come home very late.

11
00:1:22,600-->00:1:24,600
Did you find the sandwich I made for you?

12
00:1:24,600-->00:1:26,600
Thanks, dear.

13
00:1:26,600-->00:1:29,600
I was so tired

14
00:1:29,600-->00:1:30,600
I didn't even finish it.

15
00:1:30,600-->00:1:37,600
Philip, I've been working on this special project Philip

16
00:1:37,600-->00:1:38,600
with the school board,

17
00:1:38,600-->00:1:40,600
and I'd like your opinion about it.

18
00:1:40,600-->00:1:42,600
What is it?

19
00:1:42,600-->00:1:45,600
I've been trying to find

20
00:1:45,600-->00:1:47,600
a way to encourage reading.

21
00:1:47,600-->00:1:50,600
Good luck!

22
00:1:50,600-->00:1:53,600
Well, I think I may have found a way to do it.

23
00:1:53,600-->00:1:54,600
Tell me about it.

24
00:1:54,600-->00:1:57,600
I work with families every day, Ellen.

25
00:1:57,600-->00:1:59,600
I see how people spend their leisure time--

26
00:1:59,600-->00:2:1,600
young and old.

27
00:2:1,600-->00:2:3,600
Mostly watching television.

28
00:2:3,600-->00:2:5,600
Well, that would be OK

29
00:2:5,600-->00:2:7,600
if, and I repeat,

30
00:2:7,600-->00:2:9,600
if people took the time to read.

31
00:2:9,600-->00:2:11,600
I couldn't agree with you more.

32
00:2:11,600-->00:2:13,600
The question is,

33
00:2:13,600-->00:2:16,600
how do we get them to read more?

34
00:2:16,600-->00:2:18,600
I think

35
00:2:18,600-->00:2:22,600
you're going to give me the answer to that question.

36
00:2:22,600-->00:2:24,600
You have that look in your eye.

37
00:2:24,600-->00:2:26,600
I do have an answer, Philip.

38
00:2:26,600-->00:2:27,600
Or at least I think I do.

39
00:2:27,600-->00:2:31,600
Well, tell me about it.

40
00:2:31,600-->00:2:33,600
The plan is a simple one.

41
00:2:33,600-->00:2:38,600
Involve the entire family in a reading project.

42
00:2:38,600-->00:2:40,600
In the home?

43
00:2:40,600-->00:2:42,600
Yes, in the home.

44
00:2:42,600-->00:2:43,600
But first in the school-rooms.

45
00:2:43,600-->00:2:46,600
Hmm, interesting.

46
00:2:46,600-->00:2:50,600
But how do you plan to do that?

47
00:2:50,600-->00:2:53,600
By arranging with the public schools

48
00:2:53,600-->00:2:56,600
to schedule one hour a week--to start with.

49
00:2:56,600-->00:2:58,600
During that time

50
00:2:58,600-->00:3:0,600
parents are invited to attend--

51
00:3:0,600-->00:3:2,600
and to read along with the children--their children.

52
00:3:2,600-->00:3:7,600
It can go beyond the school system, Ellen.

53
00:3:7,600-->00:3:9,600
Really?

54
00:3:9,600-->00:3:15,600
I guarantee you it would go very well in the hospitals.

55
00:3:15,600-->00:3:17,600
My patients--mostly kids--

56
00:3:17,600-->00:3:20,600
would love to read and be read to.

57
00:3:20,600-->00:3:22,600
You think so?

58
00:3:22,600-->00:3:24,600
I know so.

59
00:3:24,600-->00:3:26,600
Maybe we can experiment with your patients

60
00:3:26,600-->00:3:29,600
and see how the plan works.

61
00:3:29,600-->00:3:31,600
I love the idea.

62
00:3:31,600-->00:3:37,600
Would you work with me on it?

63
00:3:37,600-->00:3:41,600
I would love to, Philip.

64
00:3:41,600-->00:3:45,600
And that way,

65
00:3:45,600-->00:3:48,600
we'll spend more time together, Ellen.

66
00:3:48,600-->00:3:52,600
We just don't see each other anymore.

67
00:3:52,600-->00:3:55,600
You and I are very busy these days.

68
00:3:55,600-->00:3:56,600
This is true.

69
00:3:56,600-->00:3:59,600
We need to find time to be together more,

70
00:3:59,600-->00:4:1,600
to do things together more--you and I.

71
00:4:1,600-->00:4:4,600
This would be a wonderful way to accomplish that.

72
00:4:4,600-->00:4:5,600
I have a question.

73
00:4:5,600-->00:4:6,600
Yes?

74
00:4:6,600-->00:4:9,600
What do we read?

75
00:4:9,600-->00:4:11,600
To the patients in the ward?

76
00:4:11,600-->00:4:12,600
Yes.

77
00:4:12,600-->00:4:14,600
Well,

78
00:4:14,600-->00:4:16,600
let you and I talk about it.

79
00:4:16,600-->00:4:19,600
What would you like to read to them?

80
00:4:19,600-->00:4:30,600

81
00:4:30,600-->00:4:33,600
Mrs. Stewart and I Stewart

82
00:4:33,600-->00:4:35,600
will read a poem by Robert Frost.

83
00:4:35,600-->00:4:37,600
It's called

84
00:4:37,600-->00:4:39,600
"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening."

85
00:4:39,600-->00:4:42,600
Would you begin, Ellen?

86
00:4:42,600-->00:4:43,600
All right.

87
00:4:43,600-->00:4:48,600
"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"

88
00:4:48,600-->00:4:51,600
by Robert Frost. Robert Frost

89
00:4:51,600-->00:4:55,600
Whose woods these are I think I know.

90
00:4:55,600-->00:4:57,600
His house is in the village though;

91
00:4:57,600-->00:5:0,600
He will not see me stopping here

92
00:5:0,600-->00:5:3,600
To watch his woods fill up with snow.

93
00:5:3,600-->00:5:6,600
My little horse must think it queer

94
00:5:6,600-->00:5:8,600
To stop without a farmhouse near

95
00:5:8,600-->00:5:11,600
Between the woods and frozen lake

96
00:5:11,600-->00:5:15,600
The darkest evening of the year.

97
00:5:15,600-->00:5:18,600
He gives his harness bells a shake

98
00:5:18,600-->00:5:20,600
To ask if there is some mistake.

99
00:5:20,600-->00:5:23,600
The only other sound's the sweep

100
00:5:23,600-->00:5:26,600
Of easy wind and downy flake.

101
00:5:26,600-->00:5:30,600
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,

102
00:5:30,600-->00:5:32,600
But I have promises to keep,

103
00:5:32,600-->00:5:35,600
And miles to go before I sleep,

104
00:5:35,600-->00:5:40,600
And miles to go before I sleep.

105
00:5:40,600-->00:5:48,600
You two belong on stage! That was wonderful!

106
00:5:48,600-->00:5:49,600
Grandpa!

107
00:5:49,600-->00:5:52,600
Dad ... Robbie. When did you come?

108
00:5:52,600-->00:5:54,600
We've been listening to you both.

109
00:5:54,600-->00:5:56,600
These are lucky kids.

110
00:5:56,600-->00:5:59,600
Do you enjoy reading together?

111
00:5:59,600-->00:6:4,600
Well, we may read together aloud at home.

112
00:6:4,600-->00:6:6,600
You were right, Robbie.

113
00:6:6,600-->00:6:7,600
I know.
