00:1:2,000-->00:1:4,000
Excuse me, officer. Can you help me?

2
00:1:4,000-->00:1:4,200
Sure.

3
00:1:4,200-->00:1:7,000
Can you tell me how to get to Linden Street in Riverdale?

4
00:1:7,000-->00:1:12,000
Richard Stewart, 46 Linden Street, Riverdale, New York.

5
00:1:12,000-->00:1:12,000

6
00:1:12,000-->00:1:13,000
You should take the number 1 subway.

7
00:1:13,000-->00:1:15,000
Is there a station near here?

8
00:1:15,000-->00:1:16,000
Yes. The station's that way.

9
00:1:16,000-->00:1:19,000
You should take the number 1 train to Van Cortlandt Park.

10
00:1:19,000-->00:1:22,000
Number 1 train to Van Cortlandt Park. Thank you.

11
00:1:22,000-->00:1:23,000
Anytime. Good luck.

12
00:1:23,000-->00:1:26,000
Remember, the number 1 train. The uptown platform.

13
00:1:26,000-->00:1:27,000
Thank you.

14
00:1:27,000-->00:1:28,000
You're welcome.

15
00:1:28,000-->00:1:47,000
Is this pink too bright for me?

16
00:1:47,000-->00:1:51,000
Mmm-hmm. It is a very bright pink.

17
00:1:51,000-->00:2:3,000
Try this. It's size eight.

18
00:2:3,000-->00:2:4,000
But I wear size ten.

19
00:2:4,000-->00:2:10,000
How about green? It's size ten.

20
00:2:10,000-->00:2:11,000
Let me try it on.

21
00:2:11,000-->00:2:15,000
I'm taking too much of your time.

22
00:2:15,000-->00:2:19,000
It's six o'clock.

23
00:2:19,000-->00:2:20,000
Where's my husband?

24
00:2:20,000-->00:2:20,300
Where's my husband?

25
00:2:20,300-->00:2:23,000
I was expecting him here at five forty-five.

26
00:2:23,000-->00:2:26,000
Don't worry. The traffic is very heavy at this hour.

27
00:2:26,000-->00:2:29,000
I know. But we're going to be late for dinner.

28
00:2:29,000-->00:2:32,000
I'll take this green sweater.

29
00:2:32,000-->00:2:34,000
I like the color on me, don't you?

30
00:2:34,000-->00:2:35,000
I think it looks terrific on you.

31
00:2:35,000-->00:2:41,000
I'm sorry I'm so late.

32
00:2:41,000-->00:2:43,000
I had a really bad day.

33
00:2:43,000-->00:2:47,000
It's ten after six. We're late.

34
00:2:47,000-->00:2:49,000
Robbie's cooking tonight, and dinner's at six thirty.

35
00:2:49,000-->00:2:51,000
I know. I know. I'm really sorry.

36
00:2:51,000-->00:2:54,000
I left my bag of film on the ferry.

37
00:2:54,000-->00:2:56,000
I went back for it, but the ferry was gone.

38
00:2:56,000-->00:2:58,000
I lost a whole day's work.

39
00:2:58,000-->00:3:2,000
I'll call the Staten Island Ferry lost-and-found office.

40
00:3:2,000-->00:3:3,000
I didn't think of that. Thanks.

41
00:3:3,000-->00:3:10,000
Hello.

42
00:3:10,000-->00:3:13,000
Yes. The number, please,

I really appreciate it, Marilyn.

47
00:3:26,000-->00:3:27,000
I really appreciate it, Marilyn.

48
00:3:27,000-->00:3:29,000
Hello.

49
00:3:29,000-->00:3:33,000
Did anyone find a camera bag this afternoon,

50
00:3:33,000-->00:3:36,000
a small canvas bag,

51
00:3:36,000-->00:3:40,000
on the J. F. Kennedy Ferry?...No?

52
00:3:40,000-->00:3:46,000
Maybe someone will find it.

53
00:3:46,000-->00:3:49,000
The name is Stewart, Richard Stewart.

54
00:3:49,000-->00:3:55,000
And the telephone number is five five five...

55
00:3:55,000-->00:3:57,000
three oh nine oh. Thank you.

56
00:3:57,000-->00:4:1,000
Sorry, Richard. They don't have it.

57
00:4:1,000-->00:4:3,000
Thanks, anyway.

58
00:4:3,000-->00:4:8,000
There was a girl on the ferry.

59
00:4:8,000-->00:4:12,000
Now maybe...

60
00:4:12,000-->00:4:15,000
Tell me about it on the way home.
