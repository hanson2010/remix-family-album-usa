00:0:52,600-->00:0:55,600
Hi, Michelle.

2
00:0:55,600-->00:0:56,600
Hello, Harry.

3
00:0:56,600-->00:0:58,600
It's nice to see you again.

4
00:0:58,600-->00:0:59,600
Hello.

5
00:0:59,600-->00:1:0,600
Hi, Susan.

6
00:1:0,600-->00:1:3,600
We have both been excited about seeing you

7
00:1:3,600-->00:1:5,600
and having lunch with you today.

8
00:1:5,600-->00:1:7,600
Michelle picked these flowers out for you. Michelle

9
00:1:7,600-->00:1:9,600
Daddy, can we go soon?

10
00:1:9,600-->00:1:12,600
We're going to go to lunch in a few minutes, honey.

11
00:1:12,600-->00:1:14,600
But I'm thirsty.

12
00:1:14,600-->00:1:19,600
OK. You go out and get a drink of water at the fountain.

13
00:1:19,600-->00:1:21,600
The fountain is over there, Michelle.

14
00:1:21,600-->00:1:23,600
Near the Exit sign.

15
00:1:23,600-->00:1:25,600
Thank you.

16
00:1:25,600-->00:1:33,600
Michelle is a little shy. Michelle

17
00:1:33,600-->00:1:36,600
I used to be that way when I was her age.

18
00:1:36,600-->00:1:40,600
Harry, if Michelle doesn't want to go, Harry

19
00:1:40,600-->00:1:41,600
we don't have to.

20
00:1:41,600-->00:1:42,600
She'll be fine.

21
00:1:42,600-->00:1:43,600
Remember,

22
00:1:43,600-->00:1:46,600
I haven't dated any one else since her mother died.

23
00:1:46,600-->00:1:49,600
This is a little difficult for her.

24
00:1:49,600-->00:1:50,600
Are you ready to go?

25
00:1:50,600-->00:1:54,600
Yes. But could you wait one minute?

26
00:1:54,600-->00:1:55,600
I have a call to make.

27
00:1:55,600-->00:1:57,600
Would you excuse me?

28
00:1:57,600-->00:2:4,600
Sam, get Mr. Levine at Toytown Stores Sam

29
00:2:4,600-->00:2:6,600
on the telephone for me, please.

30
00:2:6,600-->00:2:7,600
Right.

31
00:2:7,600-->00:2:15,600
Hello. Susan Stewart calling Mr. Levine, please.

32
00:2:15,600-->00:2:17,600
He's on the phone.

33
00:2:17,600-->00:2:22,600
Mr. Levine, Susan Stewart. Levine

34
00:2:22,600-->00:2:26,600
I find myself in an embarrassing situation.

35
00:2:26,600-->00:2:29,600
I made another lunch date for today

36
00:2:29,600-->00:2:32,600
and forgot to enter it in my appointment book.

37
00:2:32,600-->00:2:35,600
Can you and I meet for drinks tomorrow?

38
00:2:35,600-->00:2:40,600
I'd really appreciate it.... Yes.... Thank you....

39
00:2:40,600-->00:2:43,600
Tomorrow at five o'clock at the Biltmore.

40
00:2:43,600-->00:2:44,600
I'll see you then.

41
00:2:44,600-->00:2:45,600
Thank you, Mr. Levine.

42
00:2:45,600-->00:3:8,600

43
00:3:8,600-->00:3:12,600
Welcome to the South Street restaurant, folks.

44
00:3:12,600-->00:3:13,600
What'll it be?

45
00:3:13,600-->00:3:14,600
What do you recommend?

46
00:3:14,600-->00:3:16,600
Well, the crab salad's always a big hit.

47
00:3:16,600-->00:3:18,600
Susan, would you like the crab salad? Susan

48
00:3:18,600-->00:3:19,600
I'd love the crab salad.

49
00:3:19,600-->00:3:22,600
Michelle, would you like to try the crab salad, too? Michelle

50
00:3:22,600-->00:3:23,600
OK, Daddy.

51
00:3:23,600-->00:3:25,600
We'll have three crab salads

52
00:3:25,600-->00:3:26,600
and a pitcher of lemonade.

53
00:3:26,600-->00:3:30,600
Help yourself to celery and carrots and other vegetables.

54
00:3:30,600-->00:3:32,600
We used to catch crabs.

55
00:3:32,600-->00:3:34,600
Where was that?

56
00:3:34,600-->00:3:36,600
We had a summer house on Fire Island.

57
00:3:36,600-->00:3:37,600
Do you remember, Michelle?

58
00:3:37,600-->00:3:38,600
Sure.

59
00:3:38,600-->00:3:40,600
You and Mommy used to take me on the ferryboat.

60
00:3:40,600-->00:3:41,600
Sometimes, at night,

61
00:3:41,600-->00:3:43,600
we would go down to the beach and catch crabs,

62
00:3:43,600-->00:3:44,600
remember?

63
00:3:44,600-->00:3:47,600
With a piece of meat on a string!

64
00:3:47,600-->00:3:48,600
Right.

65
00:3:48,600-->00:3:51,600
Well, I think I'm going to go get us all some vegetables.

66
00:3:51,600-->00:4:2,600

67
00:4:2,600-->00:4:5,600
There you go.

68
00:4:5,600-->00:4:6,600
Thank you.

69
00:4:6,600-->00:4:16,600
And some ice-cold lemonade.

70
00:4:16,600-->00:4:17,600
Thank you.

71
00:4:17,600-->00:4:18,600
Enjoy it.

72
00:4:18,600-->00:4:26,600
Michelle, can I help you with the lemonade? Michelle

73
00:4:26,600-->00:4:27,600
No, thank you.

74
00:4:27,600-->00:4:28,600
I'll wait for my father.

75
00:4:28,600-->00:4:33,600
Michelle, can we have a talk? Michelle

76
00:4:33,600-->00:4:35,600
Sure.

77
00:4:35,600-->00:4:37,600
I know you miss your mother.

78
00:4:37,600-->00:4:38,600
You do?

79
00:4:38,600-->00:4:42,600
Yes. And I'm not trying to take her place.

80
00:4:42,600-->00:4:45,600
Then why are you and Daddy

81
00:4:45,600-->00:4:46,600
spending so much time together?

82
00:4:46,600-->00:4:49,600
Because we like each other.

83
00:4:49,600-->00:4:52,600
And right now, he needs a friend.

84
00:4:52,600-->00:4:53,600
I'm his friend.

85
00:4:53,600-->00:4:55,600
I know you are.

86
00:4:55,600-->00:4:59,600
Sometimes he's very sad.

87
00:4:59,600-->00:5:2,600
And so are you, I think.

88
00:5:2,600-->00:5:3,600
Sometimes.

89
00:5:3,600-->00:5:6,600
I'd like to be your friend, too.

90
00:5:6,600-->00:5:12,600
Will you let me be your friend, Michelle?

91
00:5:12,600-->00:5:20,600
So, what were you two talking about?

92
00:5:20,600-->00:5:22,600
Just girl talk, Daddy.

93
00:5:22,600-->00:5:24,600
It's too hard to explain.

94
00:5:24,600-->00:5:25,600
You're probably right.

95
00:5:25,600-->00:5:27,600
Well, let's get started.
