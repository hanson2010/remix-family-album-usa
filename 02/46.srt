1
00:2:0,600-->00:2:3,600
The mailman just dropped some mail in our box, Grandpa.

2
00:2:3,600-->00:2:7,600
Probably a lot of advertising and bills.

3
00:2:7,600-->00:2:9,600
Why don't you write to me, Robbie,

4
00:2:9,600-->00:2:11,600
so I can get some interesting mail?

5
00:2:11,600-->00:2:34,600
You were right, Grandpa.

6
00:2:34,600-->00:2:39,600
Advertising, bills, bills, advertising.

7
00:2:39,600-->00:2:42,600
Yes. It's just like I said, Robbie.

8
00:2:42,600-->00:2:44,600
Nothing interesting.

9
00:2:44,600-->00:2:47,600
You won't believe it, Grandpa,

10
00:2:47,600-->00:2:49,600
but there's a letter here addressed to you,

11
00:2:49,600-->00:2:52,600
Mr. Malcolm Stewart, and it looks like a personal letter. Malcolm Stewarrt

12
00:2:52,600-->00:2:53,600
Oh, it must be a bill.

13
00:2:53,600-->00:2:55,600
I don't think so.

14
00:2:55,600-->00:2:57,600
The return name and address is

15
00:2:57,600-->00:3:0,600
Pete Waters, RFD Number 1, Chesterton. Pete Waters CChesterton

16
00:3:0,600-->00:3:3,600
You're joking. Pete Waters?

17
00:3:3,600-->00:3:7,600
Pete Waters, RFD Number 1, Chesterton. Pete Waters

18
00:3:7,600-->00:3:8,600
You know him?

19
00:3:8,600-->00:3:10,600
Do I know Pete Waters?

20
00:3:10,600-->00:3:13,600
You bet I do!

21
00:3:13,600-->00:3:15,600
He was my roommate in college.

22
00:3:15,600-->00:3:23,600
He visited with Grandma and me in Florida

23
00:3:23,600-->00:3:24,600
about five years ago.

24
00:3:24,600-->00:3:33,600
What does he say?

25
00:3:33,600-->00:3:34,600
Is he OK?

26
00:3:34,600-->00:3:35,600
Yeah, he's fine.

27
00:3:35,600-->00:3:36,600
Just fine.

28
00:3:36,600-->00:3:41,600
He's writing to invite me

29
00:3:41,600-->00:3:43,600
to spend a weekend with him at his farm.

30
00:3:43,600-->00:3:45,600
He's planning a get-together

31
00:3:45,600-->00:3:47,600
with two or three other college friends.

32
00:3:47,600-->00:3:53,600
A kind of a fifty-year anniversary reunion.

33
00:3:53,600-->00:3:55,600
Sounds like fun.

34
00:3:55,600-->00:3:57,600
Fifty years? Wow!

35
00:3:57,600-->00:4:0,600
It sounds like fun to me, too, Robbie.

36
00:4:0,600-->00:4:2,600
What kind of farm does he have?

37
00:4:2,600-->00:4:4,600
I've never been there, Robbie,

38
00:4:4,600-->00:4:8,600
but he has chickens and cows and all.

39
00:4:8,600-->00:4:12,600
That means fresh eggs and fresh milk.

40
00:4:12,600-->00:4:14,600
Does he have a family?

41
00:4:14,600-->00:4:16,600
No, he doesn't, Robbie.

42
00:4:16,600-->00:4:17,600
He never married.

43
00:4:17,600-->00:4:20,600
He's not as lucky as I am

44
00:4:20,600-->00:4:23,600
to have a family and grandchildren.

45
00:4:23,600-->00:4:25,600
I'm a lucky man.

46
00:4:25,600-->00:4:28,600
How come he never got married?

47
00:4:28,600-->00:4:30,600
That's a good question, Robbie.

48
00:4:30,600-->00:4:32,600
A very good question.

49
00:4:32,600-->00:4:35,600
He never married because

50
00:4:35,600-->00:4:38,600
the girl he was in love with in college married someone else.

51
00:4:38,600-->00:4:40,600
As simple as that.

52
00:4:40,600-->00:4:42,600
He never got over it.

53
00:4:42,600-->00:4:44,600
He must have loved her very much.

54
00:4:44,600-->00:4:46,600
Yes. Very much.

55
00:4:46,600-->00:4:49,600
Lillian Winters.

56
00:4:49,600-->00:4:51,600
She was in our class.

57
00:4:51,600-->00:4:52,600
And what happened?

58
00:4:52,600-->00:4:55,600
She was in love with Donald McGrath,

59
00:4:55,600-->00:4:57,600
the quarterback on our football team.

60
00:4:57,600-->00:5:1,600
Football players are always popular with the ladies.

61
00:5:1,600-->00:5:5,600
She liked Pete, and they went to dances together.

62
00:5:5,600-->00:5:8,600
But her heart was with Donald.

63
00:5:8,600-->00:5:9,600
Did he ever get over it?

64
00:5:9,600-->00:5:11,600
No, he never did.

65
00:5:11,600-->00:5:13,600
Where is she today?

66
00:5:13,600-->00:5:15,600
I don't know.

67
00:5:15,600-->00:5:18,600
Maybe Lillian will be at the reunion.

68
00:5:18,600-->00:5:20,600
You think so?

69
00:5:20,600-->00:5:22,600
Pete's full of surprises. Pete

70
00:5:22,600-->00:5:24,600
I wish I could go there with you, Grandpa.

71
00:5:24,600-->00:5:26,600
What do you think the surprise will be?

72
00:5:26,600-->00:5:30,600
With Pete, you never know, Robbie.

73
00:5:30,600-->00:5:34,600
Won't it be exciting to see all your college friends there again?

74
00:5:34,600-->00:5:36,600
It is already.

75
00:5:36,600-->00:5:40,600
I'm kind of excited about going now.

76
00:5:40,600-->00:5:44,600
Next weekend ...

77
00:5:44,600-->00:5:47,600
sleep over Friday and Saturday night

78
00:5:47,600-->00:5:49,600
and come back Sunday.

79
00:5:49,600-->00:5:52,600
I can't wait!

80
00:5:52,600-->00:5:56,600
Don't you think you ought to call Pete

81
00:5:56,600-->00:5:57,600
and tell him you're coming?

82
00:5:57,600-->00:5:59,600
You're reading my mind, Robbie.
