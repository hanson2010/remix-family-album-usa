00:2:14,600-->00:2:17,600
What are you doing?

2
00:2:17,600-->00:2:22,600
I think I've got them.

3
00:2:22,600-->00:2:26,600
You think you've got what?

4
00:2:26,600-->00:2:31,600
Performing arts--performing arts centers.

5
00:2:31,600-->00:2:34,600
I think I've got them all, but I'm not sure.

6
00:2:34,600-->00:2:42,600
I think you have got it, Richard.

7
00:2:42,600-->00:2:51,600
Lincoln Center, home of the Metropolitan Opera,

8
00:2:51,600-->00:3:2,600
the New York City Ballet, the New York Philharmonic.

9
00:3:2,600-->00:3:9,600
Shubert Alley, center of the theater on Broadway. Shubert Alley

10
00:3:9,600-->00:3:11,600
And Carnegie Hall.

11
00:3:11,600-->00:3:17,600
And the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.

12
00:3:17,600-->00:3:23,600
And the Music Center in Los Angeles.

13
00:3:23,600-->00:3:32,600
And the others. I do have it all.

14
00:3:32,600-->00:3:40,600
You have been working on this for some time, Richard.

15
00:3:40,600-->00:3:44,600
I'm glad you feel you've finally put it all together.

16
00:3:44,600-->00:3:46,600
What now?

17
00:3:46,600-->00:3:49,600
Now for the hard part.

18
00:3:49,600-->00:3:53,600
Oh, you think you're going to have a hard time

19
00:3:53,600-->00:3:54,600
getting the album published?

20
00:3:54,600-->00:3:56,600
Well, it won't be easy.

21
00:3:56,600-->00:4:1,600
So, what do you think you're going to do?

22
00:4:1,600-->00:4:7,600
Does the name Harvey Carlson ring a bell?

23
00:4:7,600-->00:4:10,600
Oh, yes! Harvey Carlson! I remember.

24
00:4:10,600-->00:4:12,600
He said I should call him.

25
00:4:12,600-->00:4:15,600
He's the publisher of the Carlson Publishing Company.

26
00:4:15,600-->00:4:17,600
He said they need a new book of photographs,

27
00:4:17,600-->00:4:19,600
and he really liked my concept.

28
00:4:19,600-->00:4:22,600
So, why don't you call him in the morning?

29
00:4:22,600-->00:4:28,600
Do you think I have enough to show him?

30
00:4:28,600-->00:4:32,600
I've been through every section with you, Richard.

31
00:4:32,600-->00:4:33,600
It's quite complete.

32
00:4:33,600-->00:4:36,600
And now that you're satisfied with the performing arts section,

33
00:4:36,600-->00:4:39,600
I think you should show it to Mr. Carlson.

34
00:4:39,600-->00:4:44,600
You're right. My Family Album, U.S.A. feels right.

35
00:4:44,600-->00:4:48,600
I'll call in the morning and set up an appointment to see him.

36
00:4:48,600-->00:4:54,600
He's going to love your work.

37
00:4:54,600-->00:4:57,600
Come on. Let's get some sleep.

38
00:4:57,600-->00:5:4,600
Is it too early to call Mr. Carlson?

39
00:5:4,600-->00:5:11,600
Seven after nine? No. I'm sure he's in his office.

40
00:5:11,600-->00:5:17,600
His number is five, five, five, seven, five, three, two.

41
00:5:17,600-->00:5:24,600
Five, five, five, seven, five, three, two. 5557532

42
00:5:24,600-->00:5:29,600
Hello. Mr. Carlson, please.

43
00:5:29,600-->00:5:33,600
Mr. Carlson is busy at the moment. May I help you? Carlson

44
00:5:33,600-->00:5:36,600
I'd like to make an appointment with him.

45
00:5:36,600-->00:5:38,600
And your name is ...?

46
00:5:38,600-->00:5:39,600
My name is Richard Stewart.

47
00:5:39,600-->00:5:42,600
He told me to call him about my project,

48
00:5:42,600-->00:5:43,600
Family Album, U.S.A.

49
00:5:43,600-->00:5:44,600
One moment, please.

50
00:5:44,600-->00:5:55,600
What's going on?

51
00:5:55,600-->00:6:0,600
I guess they're trying to set up an appointment for me.

52
00:6:0,600-->00:6:3,600
Mr. Stewart, I just spoke to Mr. Carlson. Stewart

53
00:6:3,600-->00:6:5,600
He would like to see you.

54
00:6:5,600-->00:6:7,600
But the only time he's available this week

55
00:6:7,600-->00:6:9,600
is tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.

56
00:6:9,600-->00:6:13,600
Thanks. Thanks a lot. Good-bye.

57
00:6:13,600-->00:6:19,600
Well, it's done. Tomorrow morning at a publisher's office.

58
00:6:19,600-->00:6:23,600
Oh, it's so exciting, isn't it, Richard?

59
00:6:23,600-->00:6:25,600
Well, finally a publisher will see my work.
