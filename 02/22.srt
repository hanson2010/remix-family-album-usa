1
00:1:50,600-->00:2:2,600
Molly, I need your special talent for handling special matters.

2
00:2:2,600-->00:2:4,600
Like what special matters?

3
00:2:4,600-->00:2:7,600
Well, I have a scheduling problem.

4
00:2:7,600-->00:2:9,600
Yes?

5
00:2:9,600-->00:2:13,600
I have three tonsillectomies set for Friday with Dr. Earl.

6
00:2:13,600-->00:2:14,600
Yes?

7
00:2:14,600-->00:2:17,600
I need to fit a fourth operation into his schedule.

8
00:2:17,600-->00:2:20,600
And... I know you can do it.

9
00:2:20,600-->00:2:22,600
Who's the patient?

10
00:2:22,600-->00:2:24,600
Carl Herrera.

11
00:2:24,600-->00:2:25,600
The boy has infected tonsils,

12
00:2:25,600-->00:2:27,600
and we should remove them as soon as possible.

13
00:2:27,600-->00:2:29,600
Well, I'll try to arrange the schedule, Dr. Stewart.

14
00:2:29,600-->00:2:31,600
But it's not going to be easy.

15
00:2:31,600-->00:2:36,600
I know you'll be able to take care of it.

16
00:2:36,600-->00:2:41,600
Well, Mrs. Herrera,

17
00:2:41,600-->00:2:44,600
Carl will be perfectly fine after we remove his tonsils.

18
00:2:44,600-->00:2:47,600
Thank you for your reassurance, Dr. Stewart.

19
00:2:47,600-->00:2:50,600
He's had so many colds and sore throats recently.

20
00:2:50,600-->00:2:53,600
Well, it's a very easy operation, Carl.

21
00:2:53,600-->00:2:54,600
You won't feel a thing.

22
00:2:54,600-->00:2:56,600
But when do they do it?

23
00:2:56,600-->00:2:58,600
This Friday.

24
00:2:58,600-->00:3:1,600
But Saturday's my birthday.

25
00:3:1,600-->00:3:7,600
Well, we could reschedule the operation, Mrs. Herrera,

26
00:3:7,600-->00:3:9,600
but I don't want to put it off too long.

27
00:3:9,600-->00:3:11,600
No, I think it's important to do it now.

28
00:3:11,600-->00:3:14,600
We can have a birthday party for you, Carl,

29
00:3:14,600-->00:3:15,600
When you come out of the hospital.

30
00:3:15,600-->00:3:18,600
But it won't be on my birthday.

31
00:3:18,600-->00:3:21,600
But your health is more important, Carl. Believe me.

32
00:3:21,600-->00:3:23,600
I don't want my tonsils out.

33
00:3:23,600-->00:3:29,600
Nurse Baker, would you come in, please?

34
00:3:29,600-->00:3:39,600
Hello, Mrs. Herrera. Hi, Carl, how you doing?

35
00:3:39,600-->00:3:42,600
I don't want my tonsils out.

36
00:3:42,600-->00:3:44,600
Come with me, Carl.

37
00:3:44,600-->00:3:46,600
You and I will talk this over.

38
00:3:46,600-->00:3:53,600
She has a special way with kids.

39
00:3:53,600-->00:3:54,600
She sure does.

40
00:3:54,600-->00:4:9,600
Carl, does your throat hurt?

41
00:4:9,600-->00:4:10,600
Yes.

42
00:4:10,600-->00:4:13,600
OK. Do you want to get better?

43
00:4:13,600-->00:4:14,600
Yes.

44
00:4:14,600-->00:4:16,600
OK. We want you to get better, too.

45
00:4:16,600-->00:4:18,600
You'll have your tonsils out tomorrow,

46
00:4:18,600-->00:4:21,600
and you won't get so many colds anymore.

47
00:4:21,600-->00:4:24,600
But if I have my tonsils out tomorrow,

48
00:4:24,600-->00:4:26,600
I'll miss my birthday party on Saturday.

49
00:4:26,600-->00:4:28,600
I know.

50
00:4:28,600-->00:4:29,600
It's a problem, isn't it?

51
00:4:29,600-->00:4:32,600
Let me try to work something out.

52
00:4:32,600-->00:4:35,600
What?

53
00:4:35,600-->00:4:37,600
I have to think about it.

54
00:4:37,600-->00:4:39,600
You're fooling me.

55
00:4:39,600-->00:4:41,600
Oh, I'm not, Carl.

56
00:4:41,600-->00:4:43,600
Give me a chance to think about it,

57
00:4:43,600-->00:4:45,600
and I'll come up with something.

58
00:4:45,600-->00:4:46,600
A surprise?

59
00:4:46,600-->00:4:47,600
Maybe.

60
00:4:47,600-->00:4:49,600
But you just put on your pajamas and robe,

61
00:4:49,600-->00:4:51,600
and I'll think of a surprise.

62
00:4:51,600-->00:4:53,600
Will it hurt?

63
00:4:53,600-->00:4:54,600
No.

64
00:4:54,600-->00:4:56,600
There are other boys and girls here,

65
00:4:56,600-->00:4:57,600
and they're having their tonsils out.

66
00:4:57,600-->00:4:58,600
You'll meet them.

67
00:4:58,600-->00:4:59,600
I don't want to.

68
00:4:59,600-->00:5:2,600
Change your clothes, Carl.

69
00:5:2,600-->00:5:4,600
Everything will be just fine.
