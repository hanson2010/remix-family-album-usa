00:0:39,600-->00:0:42,600
Here's the bag.

2
00:0:42,600-->00:0:43,600
Will he be OK, Dad?

3
00:0:43,600-->00:0:45,600
I hope so.

4
00:0:45,600-->00:0:52,600
That's it.

5
00:0:52,600-->00:0:54,600
That's the way.

6
00:0:54,600-->00:0:55,600
That's it. There.

7
00:0:55,600-->00:0:58,600
Oh, it's going to be all right.

8
00:0:58,600-->00:1:0,600
That's it.

9
00:1:0,600-->00:1:2,600
Wrap him in the blanket, Dad!

10
00:1:2,600-->00:1:4,600
That's it. That's it.

11
00:1:4,600-->00:1:6,600
It's all right, Albert.

12
00:1:6,600-->00:1:7,600
You're going to be OK.

13
00:1:7,600-->00:1:10,600
I want my daddy!

14
00:1:10,600-->00:1:11,600
We'll take you to him.

15
00:1:11,600-->00:1:16,600
Easy now. Easy does it. That's it.

16
00:1:16,600-->00:1:20,600
Your dad is quite a guy.

17
00:1:20,600-->00:1:22,600
I know, Grandpa.

18
00:1:22,600-->00:1:24,600
How is he, Philip?

19
00:1:24,600-->00:1:25,600
He's asleep.

20
00:1:25,600-->00:1:26,600
He's going to be fine.

21
00:1:26,600-->00:1:28,600
How can I thank all of you?

22
00:1:28,600-->00:1:30,600
Thank my son Robbie.

23
00:1:30,600-->00:1:31,600
He pulled him out of the water.

24
00:1:31,600-->00:1:32,600
I'm very grateful, Robbie.

25
00:1:32,600-->00:1:34,600
Dad saved him, not me.

26
00:1:34,600-->00:1:36,600
I'm so thankful to all of you.

27
00:1:36,600-->00:1:39,600
So long.

28
00:1:39,600-->00:1:42,600
He's a lucky boy.

29
00:1:42,600-->00:1:46,600
Well, what do you say we get back to our fishing?

30
00:1:46,600-->00:1:48,600
That's a great idea.

31
00:1:48,600-->00:1:52,600
Uh-oh. It's probably the hospital.

32
00:1:52,600-->00:1:54,600
I have to get to a phone.

33
00:1:54,600-->00:1:58,600
It probably means we can't stay.

34
00:1:58,600-->00:1:59,600
That's OK.

35
00:1:59,600-->00:2:7,600
One of my patients has a high fever,

36
00:2:7,600-->00:2:9,600
and I have to go to the hospital.

37
00:2:9,600-->00:2:11,600
I'm sorry, Robbie.

38
00:2:11,600-->00:2:13,600
I guess I ruined your day.

39
00:2:13,600-->00:2:15,600
You didn't ruin my day, Dad.

40
00:2:15,600-->00:2:22,600
I understand. I really do.

41
00:2:22,600-->00:2:50,600
Why are you back so early?

42
00:2:50,600-->00:2:52,600
Philip had to go back to the hospital. Philip

43
00:2:52,600-->00:2:54,600
He had an emergency.

44
00:2:54,600-->00:2:56,600
Oh, that's too bad, Robbie.

45
00:2:56,600-->00:2:57,600
Did it spoil your fun?

46
00:2:57,600-->00:2:59,600
No, Mom. We had a great time.

47
00:2:59,600-->00:3:1,600
Well, did you do any fishing?

48
00:3:1,600-->00:3:5,600
Yeah, we caught lots of them. Look!

49
00:3:5,600-->00:3:11,600
They had a special on frozen fish down at the supermarket.

50
00:3:11,600-->00:3:15,600
Oh, you really had a bad day.

51
00:3:15,600-->00:3:17,600
We had a good day.

52
00:3:17,600-->00:3:20,600
Robbie pulled a boy out of the water. Robbie

53
00:3:20,600-->00:3:22,600
And Dad saved his life.

54
00:3:22,600-->00:3:24,600
He's a terrific doctor, Mom.

55
00:3:24,600-->00:3:26,600
I know.

56
00:3:26,600-->00:3:41,600
Hi, Pop. Hi, Son.

57
00:3:41,600-->00:3:42,600
Hello, Dad.

58
00:3:42,600-->00:3:44,600
What a day!

59
00:3:44,600-->00:3:46,600
How about a cup of coffee, Son?

60
00:3:46,600-->00:3:49,600
I'd love a cup of coffee.

61
00:3:49,600-->00:3:57,600
How was the patient?

62
00:3:57,600-->00:3:58,600
She'll be fine.

63
00:3:58,600-->00:4:1,600
Was it serious?

64
00:4:1,600-->00:4:3,600
No.

65
00:4:3,600-->00:4:7,600
Until today, I was never really interested in medicine.

66
00:4:7,600-->00:4:11,600
Well, it's hard work.

67
00:4:11,600-->00:4:13,600
Now I know.

68
00:4:13,600-->00:4:17,600
I had a good time today, Robbie.

69
00:4:17,600-->00:4:18,600
Me, too.

70
00:4:18,600-->00:4:21,600
Why don't we do it again?

71
00:4:21,600-->00:4:24,600
Can we? When?

72
00:4:24,600-->00:4:25,600
How about next Saturday?

73
00:4:25,600-->00:4:27,600
Won't you be busy?

74
00:4:27,600-->00:4:31,600
I'm changing my schedule.

75
00:4:31,600-->00:4:34,600
Well, do we have a date?

76
00:4:34,600-->00:4:35,600
We sure do, Dad.

77
00:4:35,600-->00:4:38,600
Grandpa, can you come?

78
00:4:38,600-->00:4:40,600
I have other plans, Robbie.

79
00:4:40,600-->00:4:45,600
But I think you two can have a good time together without me.

80
00:4:45,600-->00:4:52,600
No, Dad, and certainly not without the right magic.
