1
00:2:14,600-->00:2:17,600
It looks wrong.

2
00:2:17,600-->00:2:20,600
Hmmm. It is wrong.

3
00:2:20,600-->00:2:22,600
Are they always that difficult to make?

4
00:2:22,600-->00:2:25,600
The truth is ... yes.

5
00:2:25,600-->00:2:27,600
I'll try again.

6
00:2:27,600-->00:2:28,600
At this rate,

7
00:2:28,600-->00:2:29,600
the wedding will take place tomorrow.

8
00:2:29,600-->00:2:31,600
Not to worry.

9
00:2:31,600-->00:2:34,600
OK. Here we go.

10
00:2:34,600-->00:2:46,600
I'm worried, Philip.

11
00:2:46,600-->00:2:48,600
What if we can't tie the tie?

12
00:2:48,600-->00:2:49,600
If we can't tie the tie,

13
00:2:49,600-->00:2:50,600
then there can't be a wedding.

14
00:2:50,600-->00:2:52,600
You'd better not make Harry

15
00:2:52,600-->00:2:53,600
any more nervous than he is.

16
00:2:53,600-->00:2:54,600
Don't worry.

17
00:2:54,600-->00:2:55,600
We'll figure a way.

18
00:2:55,600-->00:2:57,600
How're you doing, fellas?

19
00:2:57,600-->00:2:58,600
Not so good, Grandpa.

20
00:2:58,600-->00:2:59,600
We can't get this bow tie tied.

21
00:2:59,600-->00:3:1,600
Nobody knows how to do it.

22
00:3:1,600-->00:3:2,600
Do you?

23
00:3:2,600-->00:3:3,600
No. I never could, either.

24
00:3:3,600-->00:3:5,600
Well, you have your own tuxedo.

25
00:3:5,600-->00:3:6,600
How do you tie your bow tie?

26
00:3:6,600-->00:3:7,600
Yeah, Grandpa,

27
00:3:7,600-->00:3:8,600
I've seen you in it.

28
00:3:8,600-->00:3:9,600
You look great.

29
00:3:9,600-->00:3:10,600
How do you tie it?

30
00:3:10,600-->00:3:11,600
I don't.

31
00:3:11,600-->00:3:12,600
What do you mean?

32
00:3:12,600-->00:3:16,600
I never could tie one of those ...

33
00:3:16,600-->00:3:18,600
things ... bow ties.

34
00:3:18,600-->00:3:21,600
I have always worn a clip-on bow tie.

35
00:3:21,600-->00:3:22,600
A clip-on?

36
00:3:22,600-->00:3:23,600
Of course.

37
00:3:23,600-->00:3:25,600
Now I remember.

38
00:3:25,600-->00:3:26,600
Yes, it's so easy.

39
00:3:26,600-->00:3:27,600
All you do is

40
00:3:27,600-->00:3:29,600
clip it around under your collar.

41
00:3:29,600-->00:3:31,600
We all need one of those.

42
00:3:31,600-->00:3:33,600
The tuxedo rental store.

43
00:3:33,600-->00:3:35,600
Do you think they're open?

44
00:3:35,600-->00:3:36,600
Should be.

45
00:3:36,600-->00:3:37,600
Sunday's their big day.

46
00:3:37,600-->00:3:38,600
I'll call and find out.

47
00:3:38,600-->00:3:39,600
Well, if they're not,

48
00:3:39,600-->00:3:41,600
I'll lend you mine, Harry.

49
00:3:41,600-->00:3:43,600
You're the only one

50
00:3:43,600-->00:3:45,600
who really needs to be wearing a tuxedo,

51
00:3:45,600-->00:3:46,600
Thanks, Grandpa.

52
00:3:46,600-->00:3:48,600
I'm the father of the bride.

53
00:3:48,600-->00:3:50,600
I'm supposed to be worried about my daughter,

54
00:3:50,600-->00:3:51,600
and here I am with

55
00:3:51,600-->00:3:52,600
the man that's marrying my daughter--

56
00:3:52,600-->00:3:53,600
worrying about him.

57
00:3:53,600-->00:3:56,600
Poor Harry.

58
00:3:56,600-->00:3:58,600
I know the feeling.

59
00:3:58,600-->00:4:0,600
Wedding-day Jitters.

60
00:4:0,600-->00:4:2,600
Are they open?

61
00:4:2,600-->00:4:3,600
We're in luck.

62
00:4:3,600-->00:4:4,600
They're open.

63
00:4:4,600-->00:4:6,600
And they have lots of clip-on bow ties.

64
00:4:6,600-->00:4:8,600
I'll bicycle down to the village and get them.

65
00:4:8,600-->00:4:9,600
You'd better hurry, Robbie.

66
00:4:9,600-->00:4:11,600
There's lots of time.

67
00:4:11,600-->00:4:13,600
A little over two hours.

68
00:4:13,600-->00:4:18,600
In two hours and fifteen minutes

69
00:4:18,600-->00:4:20,600
I'll be married to Susan.

70
00:4:20,600-->00:4:24,600
And be a true member of the Stewart family.

71
00:4:24,600-->00:4:26,600
Oh, you're a lucky guy, Harry.

72
00:4:26,600-->00:4:29,600
Susan is one of the best women you'll ever find. Susan

73
00:4:29,600-->00:4:31,600
She's just like her grandma.

74
00:4:31,600-->00:4:33,600
Now, once you put the ring on Susan's finger,

75
00:4:33,600-->00:4:35,600
you are one of us, Harry.

76
00:4:35,600-->00:4:36,600
And don't ever forget it.

77
00:4:36,600-->00:4:41,600
Ring? Ring?

78
00:4:41,600-->00:4:43,600
Oh my!

79
00:4:43,600-->00:4:44,600
What did I do with the rings?

80
00:4:44,600-->00:4:48,600
I put them in the pocket of my sports jacket.

81
00:4:48,600-->00:4:49,600
No,

82
00:4:49,600-->00:4:50,600
I think you put them

83
00:4:50,600-->00:4:51,600
in your tuxedo jacket pocket.

84
00:4:51,600-->00:4:52,600
Remember?

85
00:4:52,600-->00:4:54,600
Right.

86
00:4:54,600-->00:5:0,600
What did I do with the rings?

87
00:5:0,600-->00:5:2,600
Didn't you give them to Richard?

88
00:5:2,600-->00:5:3,600
He's your best man.

89
00:5:3,600-->00:5:5,600
I remember.

90
00:5:5,600-->00:5:6,600
You gave them to Richard.

91
00:5:6,600-->00:5:7,600
Oh, yeah.

92
00:5:7,600-->00:5:8,600
I remember now.

93
00:5:8,600-->00:5:9,600
You handed them to me.

94
00:5:9,600-->00:5:11,600
What did I do with them?

95
00:5:11,600-->00:5:13,600
I hope they aren't lost.

96
00:5:13,600-->00:5:14,600
Oh, don't worry, Harry.

97
00:5:14,600-->00:5:16,600
They have to be here.

98
00:5:16,600-->00:5:17,600
I remember.

99
00:5:17,600-->00:5:19,600
I gave them to Robbie to hold

100
00:5:19,600-->00:5:20,600
so I wouldn't lose them.

101
00:5:20,600-->00:5:21,600
Where's Robbie? Robbie

102
00:5:21,600-->00:5:22,600
Relax, Harry.

103
00:5:22,600-->00:5:23,600
Robbie went to pick up Robbie

104
00:5:23,600-->00:5:25,600
the clip-on bow ties.

105
00:5:25,600-->00:5:26,600
Oh, I forgot.

106
00:5:26,600-->00:5:28,600
What time is it?

107
00:5:28,600-->00:5:30,600
It's still a little over two hours, Harry.

108
00:5:30,600-->00:5:31,600
Just relax.

109
00:5:31,600-->00:5:33,600
What about the rings?

110
00:5:33,600-->00:5:34,600
I'm sure Robbie has them.

111
00:5:34,600-->00:5:41,600
No, no, Robbie doesn't have them.

112
00:5:41,600-->00:5:43,600
He gave them to me to hold on to them

113
00:5:43,600-->00:5:45,600
because he didn't want the responsibility of holding them.

114
00:5:45,600-->00:5:47,600
I put them in my tuxedo--

115
00:5:47,600-->00:5:51,600
but in the lapel pocket.

116
00:5:51,600-->00:5:56,600
That's a relief.

117
00:5:56,600-->00:5:59,600
I was really worried.

118
00:5:59,600-->00:6:1,600
I'll hold on to them for you.

119
00:6:1,600-->00:6:2,600
The best man always keeps the rings.

120
00:6:2,600-->00:6:3,600
You're right.

121
00:6:3,600-->00:6:5,600
You hold on to them so there won't be a problem later.

122
00:6:5,600-->00:6:6,600
Well,

123
00:6:6,600-->00:6:8,600
now, I think we'd better get dressed, fellas.

124
00:6:8,600-->00:6:9,600
All right!

125
00:6:9,600-->00:6:10,600
Robbie will bring the ties back. Robbie

126
00:6:10,600-->00:6:13,600
Hey, leaving me?

127
00:6:13,600-->00:6:14,600
You'll be fine.

128
00:6:14,600-->00:6:16,600
Try to take it easy.

129
00:6:16,600-->00:6:18,600
It'll all be over in two hours.

130
00:6:18,600-->00:6:19,600
Over?

131
00:6:19,600-->00:6:22,600
The wedding ceremony will be over.

132
00:6:22,600-->00:6:24,600
You'll be husband and wife.

133
00:6:24,600-->00:6:25,600
I guess you're right.

134
00:6:25,600-->00:6:27,600
Two hours from now.
