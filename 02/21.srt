1
00:0:50,600-->00:0:53,600
OK.

2
00:0:53,600-->00:0:56,600
If you want to adopt an animal,

3
00:0:56,600-->00:0:58,600
first we need to know some references.

4
00:0:58,600-->00:1:0,600
References?

5
00:1:0,600-->00:1:2,600
People we know?

6
00:1:2,600-->00:1:5,600
Friends, teachers...

7
00:1:5,600-->00:1:7,600
We need to talk to some people about you.

8
00:1:7,600-->00:1:10,600
We want to be sure that you're responsible

9
00:1:10,600-->00:1:12,600
and that you can take good care of an animal.

10
00:1:12,600-->00:1:15,600
Then you have to fill out this form

11
00:1:15,600-->00:1:16,600
about your family background.

12
00:1:16,600-->00:1:18,600
Is that it?

13
00:1:18,600-->00:1:20,600
No, there's more.

14
00:1:20,600-->00:1:24,600
We need to know about your history with animals.

15
00:1:24,600-->00:1:25,600
Have you ever owned an animal?

16
00:1:25,600-->00:1:26,600
Yes.

17
00:1:26,600-->00:1:29,600
We had a cat when I was eight years old.

18
00:1:29,600-->00:1:30,600
I love cats.

19
00:1:30,600-->00:1:32,600
Do you have any animals now?

20
00:1:32,600-->00:1:34,600
Unfortunately, no.

21
00:1:34,600-->00:1:36,600
Anything else?

22
00:1:36,600-->00:1:37,600
We also like to know

23
00:1:37,600-->00:1:39,600
your reasons for wanting an animal.

24
00:1:39,600-->00:1:42,600
Just to hold it and cuddle with it.

25
00:1:42,600-->00:1:44,600
Just to have as a pet.

26
00:1:44,600-->00:1:45,600
I love animals.

27
00:1:45,600-->00:1:50,600
To have a friend - a pal.

28
00:1:50,600-->00:1:53,600
You know, man's best friend is his dog.

29
00:1:53,600-->00:1:56,600
And one thing more.

30
00:1:56,600-->00:1:58,600
If you're under 21 years of age...

31
00:1:58,600-->00:1:59,600
That's me.

32
00:1:59,600-->00:2:0,600
Then an adult must sign for you.

33
00:2:0,600-->00:2:1,600
Uh-oh.

34
00:2:1,600-->00:2:3,600
No problem.

35
00:2:3,600-->00:2:5,600
My parents will think it's a good idea.

36
00:2:5,600-->00:2:7,600
I'll be back with them.

37
00:2:7,600-->00:2:9,600
If the real owners don't come to claim Gemma...

38
00:2:9,600-->00:2:11,600
After forty-eight hours.

39
00:2:11,600-->00:2:13,600
But please call first.

40
00:2:13,600-->00:2:17,600
Thanks for your information and for being so helpful.

41
00:2:17,600-->00:2:18,600
It's my pleasure.

42
00:2:18,600-->00:2:20,600
Nice talking to both of you.

43
00:2:20,600-->00:2:21,600
Thanks again.

44
00:2:21,600-->00:2:22,600
Bye.

45
00:2:22,600-->00:2:26,600
Maybe the real owners will come to claim her.

46
00:2:26,600-->00:2:28,600
Her eyes look so sad.

47
00:2:28,600-->00:2:30,600
She must really miss them.

48
00:2:30,600-->00:2:32,600
I see you're both animal lovers.

49
00:2:32,600-->00:2:33,600
We are.

50
00:2:33,600-->00:2:34,600
Good-bye, Miss Aborn.

51
00:2:34,600-->00:2:36,600
We'll call in a couple of days.

52
00:2:36,600-->00:2:38,600
Good-bye, and thanks for bringing Gemma in.

53
00:2:38,600-->00:2:40,600
Bye.

54
00:2:40,600-->00:2:53,600
I keep thinking about the dog, about Gemma,

55
00:2:53,600-->00:2:54,600
alone in the animal shelter.

56
00:2:54,600-->00:2:56,600
I know.

57
00:2:56,600-->00:2:58,600
But I promise you, Alexandra,

58
00:2:58,600-->00:3:0,600
the dog is just fine.

59
00:3:0,600-->00:3:2,600
They're very kind to the animals.

60
00:3:2,600-->00:3:3,600
I know they are.

61
00:3:3,600-->00:3:5,600
I mean about her being alone.

62
00:3:5,600-->00:3:7,600
Even if they are kind to Gemma,

63
00:3:7,600-->00:3:9,600
she's still alone, without her family.

64
00:3:9,600-->00:3:11,600
Ready, folks?

65
00:3:11,600-->00:3:12,600
Are you ready, Alexandra?

66
00:3:12,600-->00:3:14,600
Yes, I'm ready.

67
00:3:14,600-->00:3:16,600
I'll have the chef's salad, please.

68
00:3:16,600-->00:3:20,600
I will have a cheeseburger, medium rare,

69
00:3:20,600-->00:3:23,600
with raw onion, and french fries, please.

70
00:3:23,600-->00:3:25,600
Anything to drink?

71
00:3:25,600-->00:3:26,600
A diet cola, please.

72
00:3:26,600-->00:3:29,600
Ginger ale with lots of ice for me, thank you.

73
00:3:29,600-->00:3:30,600
I've got it.

74
00:3:30,600-->00:3:31,600
Thanks.

75
00:3:31,600-->00:3:34,600
Aren't you surprised

76
00:3:34,600-->00:3:35,600
that the animal shelter is so careful

77
00:3:35,600-->00:3:37,600
about finding homes for the animals?

78
00:3:37,600-->00:3:39,600
No, I'm not.

79
00:3:39,600-->00:3:41,600
And a cheeseburger, medium rare,

80
00:3:41,600-->00:3:43,600
with onion and french fries.

81
00:3:43,600-->00:3:45,600
And a ginger ale with lots of ice.

82
00:3:45,600-->00:3:48,600
Salad dressing?

83
00:3:48,600-->00:3:52,600
Hey, I wanted you to hear my new sound system

84
00:3:52,600-->00:3:54,600
when the dog scratched on the front door.

85
00:3:54,600-->00:3:55,600
Let's finish eating,

86
00:3:55,600-->00:3:57,600
and then we'll go back to my house.

87
00:3:57,600-->00:3:59,600
I want you to hear my new tapes.

88
00:3:59,600-->00:4:1,600
I've got some great new dance music.

89
00:4:1,600-->00:4:21,600
(music... beep...)

90
00:4:21,600-->00:4:22,600
Hello.

91
00:4:22,600-->00:4:23,600
Stewart residence.

92
00:4:23,600-->00:4:24,600
Hello.

93
00:4:24,600-->00:4:25,600
Is Robbie Stewart there?

94
00:4:25,600-->00:4:26,600
This is he.

95
00:4:26,600-->00:4:27,600
Who's this?

96
00:4:27,600-->00:4:29,600
This is Linda Aborn from the animal shelter.

97
00:4:29,600-->00:4:31,600
It's Linda from the animal shelter.

98
00:4:31,600-->00:4:33,600
Yes, Linda.

99
00:4:33,600-->00:4:34,600
Hi.

100
00:4:34,600-->00:4:37,600
We have good news and bad news, Robbie.

101
00:4:37,600-->00:4:38,600
Oh?

102
00:4:38,600-->00:4:40,600
The good news is that the Levinsons have come by

103
00:4:40,600-->00:4:41,600
to pick up the dog.

104
00:4:41,600-->00:4:45,600
The bad news is, you won't be able to adopt the dog.

105
00:4:45,600-->00:4:46,600
That's OK.

106
00:4:46,600-->00:4:50,600
Come by one day and look at some of the other dogs.

107
00:4:50,600-->00:4:52,600
I'm sure there's one for you.

108
00:4:52,600-->00:4:53,600
Thanks, Robbie.

109
00:4:53,600-->00:4:56,600
And the Levinsons thank you for bringing their dog to us.

110
00:4:56,600-->00:4:58,600
Thanks, Linda.

111
00:4:58,600-->00:4:59,600
Bye.

112
00:4:59,600-->00:5:9,600
The owners claimed Gemma?

113
00:5:9,600-->00:5:10,600
That's right.

114
00:5:10,600-->00:5:12,600
I'm glad for the dog.

115
00:5:12,600-->00:5:14,600
I guess I am, too.

116
00:5:14,600-->00:5:17,600
She said if I come by,

117
00:5:17,600-->00:5:18,600
she'll help me find another dog.

118
00:5:18,600-->00:5:21,600
Come on.

119
00:5:21,600-->00:5:23,600
Let's dance.
