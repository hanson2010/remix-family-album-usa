1
00:2:0,600-->00:2:3,600
Where's Mom?

2
00:2:3,600-->00:2:5,600
She went to a school-board meeting.

3
00:2:5,600-->00:2:8,600
I don't know how she does it.

4
00:2:8,600-->00:2:9,600
She sure keeps busy.

5
00:2:9,600-->00:2:11,600
It's important to her.

6
00:2:11,600-->00:2:14,600
There are lots of places to go,

7
00:2:14,600-->00:2:15,600
lots of things to do.

8
00:2:15,600-->00:2:19,600
She can't sit around and do nothing.

9
00:2:19,600-->00:2:20,600
Philip works late.

10
00:2:20,600-->00:2:22,600
I guess you're right.

11
00:2:22,600-->00:2:25,600
I wish I had her energy.

12
00:2:25,600-->00:2:27,600
Anybody home?

13
00:2:27,600-->00:2:29,600
We're in here, Dad.

14
00:2:29,600-->00:2:33,600
Oh. Hi, gang.

15
00:2:33,600-->00:2:34,600
Hello, Philip.

16
00:2:34,600-->00:2:35,600
How was your day?

17
00:2:35,600-->00:2:37,600
My day was just fine.

18
00:2:37,600-->00:2:39,600
So was my night.

19
00:2:39,600-->00:2:41,600
It's almost ten o'clock.

20
00:2:41,600-->00:2:44,600
Mmm. I'm starving.

21
00:2:44,600-->00:2:45,600
Um... where's Mom?

22
00:2:45,600-->00:2:47,600
She went to a school-board meeting.

23
00:2:47,600-->00:2:50,600
There's a note for you on the refrigerator.

24
00:2:50,600-->00:2:51,600
Oh?

25
00:2:51,600-->00:3:27,600

26
00:3:27,600-->00:3:30,600
Did you have dinner, Robbie?

27
00:3:30,600-->00:3:31,600
Yeah.

28
00:3:31,600-->00:3:32,600
Mike and I had a hamburger at the diner.

29
00:3:32,600-->00:3:33,600
I came home a little while ago.

30
00:3:33,600-->00:3:35,600
You've been working late

31
00:3:35,600-->00:3:37,600
almost every night this week, Dad.

32
00:3:37,600-->00:3:38,600
Aren't you exhausted?

33
00:3:38,600-->00:3:41,600
I don't have time to be exhausted.

34
00:3:41,600-->00:3:44,600
You and Mom haven't had dinner together with us

35
00:3:44,600-->00:3:45,600
in almost a full week.

36
00:3:45,600-->00:3:46,600
Yeah,

37
00:3:46,600-->00:3:48,600
I feel bad

38
00:3:48,600-->00:3:50,600
about us not having dinner with the family,

39
00:3:50,600-->00:3:52,600
but our schedules are so different.

40
00:3:52,600-->00:3:54,600
Either I'm at the hospital doing paperwork,

41
00:3:54,600-->00:3:56,600
or Mom is at a committee meeting.

42
00:3:56,600-->00:3:59,600
I frankly don't know what to do about it.

43
00:3:59,600-->00:4:2,600
I'm worried about you and Mom.

44
00:4:2,600-->00:4:5,600
You really have been working too hard.

45
00:4:5,600-->00:4:6,600
Well,

46
00:4:6,600-->00:4:8,600
I think I've had enough of that sandwich.

47
00:4:8,600-->00:4:10,600
You didn't finish it.

48
00:4:10,600-->00:4:15,600
It's not good to eat before going to bed.

49
00:4:15,600-->00:4:19,600
A cookie can't hurt, though.

50
00:4:19,600-->00:4:21,600
Well,

51
00:4:21,600-->00:4:23,600
I'm heading off for bed

52
00:4:23,600-->00:4:24,600
and a good night's sleep.

53
00:4:24,600-->00:4:26,600
Well, good night.

54
00:4:26,600-->00:4:27,600
Good night, Son.

55
00:4:27,600-->00:4:30,600
Good night, Dad.

56
00:4:30,600-->00:4:31,600
I'm going to bed.

57
00:4:31,600-->00:4:32,600
Good night, Philip.

58
00:4:32,600-->00:4:35,600
Haven't you finished balancing that checkbook?

59
00:4:35,600-->00:4:38,600
I found another mistake.

60
00:4:38,600-->00:4:41,600
I'll be off to bed myself in a minute.

61
00:4:41,600-->00:4:42,600
OK. Good night.

62
00:4:42,600-->00:4:53,600
I'm really concerned about them,

63
00:4:53,600-->00:4:54,600
Grandpa.

64
00:4:54,600-->00:4:55,600
Concerned about whom?

65
00:4:55,600-->00:4:57,600
About Mom and Dad.

66
00:4:57,600-->00:4:59,600
They hardly ever see each other.

67
00:4:59,600-->00:5:1,600
Dad often works late,

68
00:5:1,600-->00:5:3,600
and Mom has all these committees she's on.

69
00:5:3,600-->00:5:7,600
What do you propose to do about it?

70
00:5:7,600-->00:5:9,600
You have that look in your eye.

71
00:5:9,600-->00:5:10,600
I don't know,

72
00:5:10,600-->00:5:12,600
but there must be a way

73
00:5:12,600-->00:5:14,600
of getting them to spend more time together.

74
00:5:14,600-->00:5:17,600
Quality time.
