00:0:42,600-->00:0:45,600
Do you like the dress?

2
00:0:45,600-->00:0:46,600
I love it.

3
00:0:46,600-->00:0:48,600
I designed it myself.

4
00:0:48,600-->00:0:49,600
It's beautiful.

5
00:0:49,600-->00:0:51,600
Are you ready?

6
00:0:51,600-->00:0:53,600
We're supposed to be there

7
00:0:53,600-->00:0:54,600
before the guests arrive.

8
00:0:54,600-->00:0:55,600
I know. I know.

9
00:0:55,600-->00:1:2,600
Help me with this tie, will you?

10
00:1:2,600-->00:1:4,600
Honey, I'm scared to death.

11
00:1:4,600-->00:1:9,600
But this is what you've been working for all these years.

12
00:1:9,600-->00:1:10,600
No, no.

13
00:1:10,600-->00:1:12,600
I worked to put together a book of photographs.

14
00:1:12,600-->00:1:13,600
This is show business.

15
00:1:13,600-->00:1:15,600
Well, it's all part of the same job.

16
00:1:15,600-->00:1:17,600
Just relax and enjoy it.

17
00:1:17,600-->00:1:20,600
You're right.

18
00:1:20,600-->00:1:25,600
I earned this, and I'm going to enjoy it.

19
00:1:25,600-->00:1:31,600
As soon as I recover from my nervous breakdown.

20
00:1:31,600-->00:1:36,600
What are you afraid of?

21
00:1:36,600-->00:1:37,600
Everything.

22
00:1:37,600-->00:1:39,600
A critic was there this morning.

23
00:1:39,600-->00:1:40,600
He probably hates my work.

24
00:1:40,600-->00:1:43,600
I have to sign copies of my book for a lot of people

25
00:1:43,600-->00:1:44,600
I never met before.

26
00:1:44,600-->00:1:46,600
My new shoes hurt my feet ...

27
00:1:46,600-->00:1:58,600
You're going to be a great success.

28
00:1:58,600-->00:2:2,600
Are you ready?

29
00:2:2,600-->00:2:4,600
As soon as I get these cuff links on.

30
00:2:4,600-->00:2:5,600
Let me help.

31
00:2:5,600-->00:2:12,600
Mom and Dad are already on their way down to the gallery.

32
00:2:12,600-->00:2:20,600
There! You look very attractive.

33
00:2:20,600-->00:2:23,600
Thank you.

34
00:2:23,600-->00:2:26,600
Well, I suppose I've run out of excuses.

35
00:2:26,600-->00:2:29,600
Mm-hmm. Let's go ...

36
00:2:29,600-->00:2:32,600
Oh, one minute.

37
00:2:32,600-->00:2:35,600
Before we go to the gallery,

38
00:2:35,600-->00:2:37,600
I just want to tell you

39
00:2:37,600-->00:2:38,600
that I never could have done this book

40
00:2:38,600-->00:2:40,600
without your help and your love.

41
00:2:40,600-->00:2:43,600
I appreciate it.

42
00:2:43,600-->00:2:45,600
Thanks.

43
00:2:45,600-->00:2:51,600
Now, no more stalling.

44
00:2:51,600-->00:3:0,600

45
00:3:0,600-->00:3:1,600
What is it?

46
00:3:1,600-->00:3:2,600
There's nobody here!

47
00:3:2,600-->00:3:5,600
Of course not, Richard.

48
00:3:5,600-->00:3:8,600
Your show doesn't begin until eight thirty.

49
00:3:8,600-->00:3:12,600
Oh. Right.

50
00:3:12,600-->00:3:16,600
Richard! Welcome! Good luck tonight! Richard

51
00:3:16,600-->00:3:17,600
Well, thanks.

52
00:3:17,600-->00:3:19,600
This is my publisher, Harvey Carlson.

53
00:3:19,600-->00:3:20,600
You've met my wife Marilyn ...

54
00:3:20,600-->00:3:22,600
Charmed.

55
00:3:22,600-->00:3:24,600
My mother, Ellen Stewart.

56
00:3:24,600-->00:3:25,600
Harvey Carlson.

57
00:3:25,600-->00:3:26,600
It's good to meet you.

58
00:3:26,600-->00:3:29,600
This is my father, Dr. Philip Stewart ...

59
00:3:29,600-->00:3:30,600
Nice to meet you, Mr. Carlson.

60
00:3:30,600-->00:3:31,600
My brother Robbie ...

61
00:3:31,600-->00:3:32,600
Hi.

62
00:3:32,600-->00:3:33,600
Hi.

63
00:3:33,600-->00:3:36,600
And this is my sister Susan and her husband Harry Bennett

64
00:3:36,600-->00:3:37,600
and his daughter Michelle.

65
00:3:37,600-->00:3:39,600
It's nice to meet you.

66
00:3:39,600-->00:3:43,600
And this gentleman is my grandfather, Malcolm Stewart.

67
00:3:43,600-->00:3:45,600
Welcome, Mr. Stewart.

68
00:3:45,600-->00:3:48,600
Well, make yourselves comfortable.

69
00:3:48,600-->00:3:51,600
There are hors d'oeuvres at the table, fruit punch at the bar.

70
00:3:51,600-->00:3:52,600
Help yourselves.

71
00:3:52,600-->00:3:55,600
Can I get you something, Mr. Stewart?

72
00:3:55,600-->00:3:56,600
No, thank you.

73
00:3:56,600-->00:3:59,600
You can feel very proud of your grandson, Mr. Stewart.

74
00:3:59,600-->00:4:1,600
I do.

75
00:4:1,600-->00:4:4,600
I'm proud of all my grandchildren, Mr. Carlson.

76
00:4:4,600-->00:4:5,600
Of course.

77
00:4:5,600-->00:4:6,600
Feel free to look around.

78
00:4:6,600-->00:4:8,600
If you need anything, just ask.

79
00:4:8,600-->00:4:9,600
Thank you.

80
00:4:9,600-->00:4:11,600
Harvey? Harvey

81
00:4:11,600-->00:4:12,600
Yes?

82
00:4:12,600-->00:4:14,600
Did Mitchell Johnson's review come out yet? Mitchell Johnsson

83
00:4:14,600-->00:4:15,600
Not yet.

84
00:4:15,600-->00:4:17,600
The newspapers don't come out till about ten o'clock.

85
00:4:17,600-->00:4:19,600
When they come out, we'll get it.

86
00:4:19,600-->00:4:20,600
Thanks.

87
00:4:20,600-->00:4:22,600
Ready?

88
00:4:22,600-->00:4:25,600
Yes. Have the people arrived?

89
00:4:25,600-->00:4:26,600
The guests are waiting.

90
00:4:26,600-->00:4:28,600
Tom's about to open the doors. Tom

91
00:4:28,600-->00:4:31,600
Good luck! And stop worrying!

92
00:4:31,600-->00:4:33,600
They're going to love it.
