1
00:1:51,600-->00:1:55,600
I don't believe it!

2
00:1:55,600-->00:1:56,600
What's wrong?

3
00:1:56,600-->00:1:58,600
Carter Boswell!

4
00:1:58,600-->00:2:0,600
Who's Carter Boswell?

5
00:2:0,600-->00:2:2,600
He's running for the school board.

6
00:2:2,600-->00:2:3,600
The election's next month.

7
00:2:3,600-->00:2:5,600
What's wrong with wanting to be on the school board?

8
00:2:5,600-->00:2:6,600
Nothing.

9
00:2:6,600-->00:2:9,600
But he wants to cut the school budget!

10
00:2:9,600-->00:2:11,600
Maybe it needs cutting.

11
00:2:11,600-->00:2:14,600
Cutting the budget is fine,

12
00:2:14,600-->00:2:15,600
but he wants to do it

13
00:2:15,600-->00:2:17,600
by cutting all the cultural programs.

14
00:2:17,600-->00:2:19,600
No music, no dance,

15
00:2:19,600-->00:2:21,600
no concert, no stage presentations.

16
00:2:21,600-->00:2:22,600
Why does he want to do that?

17
00:2:22,600-->00:2:25,600
He says it's to save the taxpayers' money,

18
00:2:25,600-->00:2:27,600
and I think he believes

19
00:2:27,600-->00:2:29,600
that the taxpayers will vote for him

20
00:2:29,600-->00:2:31,600
if he spends less on the cultural programs.

21
00:2:31,600-->00:2:33,600
He's probably right.

22
00:2:33,600-->00:2:36,600
Lots of people want their taxes

23
00:2:36,600-->00:2:38,600
used for new books

24
00:2:38,600-->00:2:40,600
and a new paint job in the schoolrooms.

25
00:2:40,600-->00:2:43,600
Maybe some of us would like to pay a little bit more

26
00:2:43,600-->00:2:45,600
and keep the cultural programs for our kids.

27
00:2:45,600-->00:2:47,600
Well, I'm not sure. Ellen.

28
00:2:47,600-->00:2:50,600
I hear it from my patients.

29
00:2:50,600-->00:2:54,600
Lots of people are tired of higher taxes.

30
00:2:54,600-->00:2:57,600
I know,

31
00:2:57,600-->00:3:0,600
but if Boswell wins

32
00:3:0,600-->00:3:1,600
he'll be an important decision-maker

33
00:3:1,600-->00:3:2,600
on the school board,

34
00:3:2,600-->00:3:4,600
and he doesn't know anything

35
00:3:4,600-->00:3:5,600
about our children's education.

36
00:3:5,600-->00:3:7,600
Who's running against him?

37
00:3:7,600-->00:3:9,600
Nobody. That's the problem.

38
00:3:9,600-->00:3:12,600
Well, it sounds to me like Carter Boswell

39
00:3:12,600-->00:3:14,600
is going to win this seat on the board.

40
00:3:14,600-->00:3:17,600
Oh, not if I can stop him!

41
00:3:17,600-->00:3:19,600
And how are you going to stop him?

42
00:3:19,600-->00:3:22,600
I don't know.

43
00:3:22,600-->00:3:25,600
Maybe I'll run against him.

44
00:3:25,600-->00:3:29,600
Well, you've got my vote.

45
00:3:29,600-->00:3:34,600
I'm serious, Philip.

46
00:3:34,600-->00:3:36,600
Why shouldn't I run?

47
00:3:36,600-->00:3:39,600
Why shouldn't you run for what, Mom?

48
00:3:39,600-->00:3:40,600
Your mother is thinking of

49
00:3:40,600-->00:3:42,600
running for the school board.

50
00:3:42,600-->00:3:44,600
Hey, that's terrific, Mom!

51
00:3:44,600-->00:3:46,600
Against Carter Boswell?

52
00:3:46,600-->00:3:47,600
Great!

53
00:3:47,600-->00:3:49,600
Well, if I run for office,

54
00:3:49,600-->00:3:51,600
the voters will have a clear choice.

55
00:3:51,600-->00:3:54,600
I stand for everything Boswell doesn't.

56
00:3:54,600-->00:3:57,600
I think a lot of people will vote for you

57
00:3:57,600-->00:3:59,600
against Boswell, Ellen.

58
00:3:59,600-->00:4:0,600
I'll vote for you.

59
00:4:0,600-->00:4:3,600
Will you help me if I do run?

60
00:4:3,600-->00:4:4,600
Absolutely.

61
00:4:4,600-->00:4:7,600
The trouble is

62
00:4:7,600-->00:4:9,600
it takes a little bit of money to run a campaign.

63
00:4:9,600-->00:4:12,600
I think you can make a difference, Ellen.

64
00:4:12,600-->00:4:14,600
And in a short campaign

65
00:4:14,600-->00:4:15,600
you wouldn't need as much money.

66
00:4:15,600-->00:4:17,600
You know something, Ellen?

67
00:4:17,600-->00:4:20,600
Why not give the people of Riverdale a clear choice?

68
00:4:20,600-->00:4:22,600
I'm with you.

69
00:4:22,600-->00:4:24,600
You can make a difference.

70
00:4:24,600-->00:4:32,600
Come in.

71
00:4:32,600-->00:4:37,600
Mr. Maxwell?

72
00:4:37,600-->00:4:41,600
Yes, Charles Maxwell.

73
00:4:41,600-->00:4:43,600
My name is Ellen Stewart.

74
00:4:43,600-->00:4:45,600
Hello.

75
00:4:45,600-->00:4:47,600
Please, sit down.

76
00:4:47,600-->00:4:52,600
You asked to see me.

77
00:4:52,600-->00:4:55,600
What would you like to see me about?

78
00:4:55,600-->00:4:58,600
I'd like your help.

79
00:4:58,600-->00:4:59,600
Well,

80
00:4:59,600-->00:5:3,600
I'm editor of the most influential newspaper in Riverdale.

81
00:5:3,600-->00:5:6,600
Actually, it's the only newspaper.

82
00:5:6,600-->00:5:9,600
A lot of people would like my help.

83
00:5:9,600-->00:5:10,600
Do you have a story?

84
00:5:10,600-->00:5:13,600
I'm planning to run for the school board.

85
00:5:13,600-->00:5:15,600
Against Carter Boswell?

86
00:5:15,600-->00:5:16,600
Yes.

87
00:5:16,600-->00:5:18,600
Well, that is news.

88
00:5:18,600-->00:5:20,600
Will you announce that I'm running?

89
00:5:20,600-->00:5:23,600
Sure.

90
00:5:23,600-->00:5:24,600
But I need some information.

91
00:5:24,600-->00:5:26,600
Of course.

92
00:5:26,600-->00:5:31,600
Why will the voters vote for you against Boswell,

93
00:5:31,600-->00:5:32,600
Mrs. Stewart? Stewart

94
00:5:32,600-->00:5:34,600
Because I care.

95
00:5:34,600-->00:5:40,600
"Vote for Ellen Stewart. She cares."

96
00:5:40,600-->00:5:41,600
Not a bad slogan.

97
00:5:41,600-->00:5:44,600
But what do you care about?

98
00:5:44,600-->00:5:48,600
Well, I care about the children of our town.

99
00:5:48,600-->00:5:50,600
I don't want them to grow up

100
00:5:50,600-->00:5:52,600
without cultural programs in our school.

101
00:5:52,600-->00:5:55,600
Do you have a plan?

102
00:5:55,600-->00:5:59,600
I want our children to learn

103
00:5:59,600-->00:6:1,600
more than reading, writing, and arithmetic.

104
00:6:1,600-->00:6:4,600
I want to keep the after-school programs -

105
00:6:4,600-->00:6:6,600
the music, the concerts.

106
00:6:6,600-->00:6:9,600
It's not a bad plan.

107
00:6:9,600-->00:6:11,600
But who's going to pay for all of this?

108
00:6:11,600-->00:6:12,600
We are.

109
00:6:12,600-->00:6:15,600
The citizens of Riverdale, of course.

110
00:6:15,600-->00:6:16,600
I plan to get help

111
00:6:16,600-->00:6:19,600
from the businessmen and the corporations of Riverdale.

112
00:6:19,600-->00:6:21,600
That's fair enough.

113
00:6:21,600-->00:6:24,600
Exactly what do you want from me, Mrs. Stewart?

114
00:6:24,600-->00:6:27,600
You don't know me.

115
00:6:27,600-->00:6:31,600
I can't expect you to take my side against Boswell.

116
00:6:31,600-->00:6:33,600
But I do need some publicity

117
00:6:33,600-->00:6:35,600
so that the people of our town

118
00:6:35,600-->00:6:37,600
know that I'm running for office

119
00:6:37,600-->00:6:39,600
and that I care about our children.

120
00:6:39,600-->00:6:42,600
Fair enough.

121
00:6:42,600-->00:6:45,600
I certainly can print the news.

122
00:6:45,600-->00:6:47,600
And you are now making news.
