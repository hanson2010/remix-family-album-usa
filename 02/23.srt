1
00:0:56,600-->00:0:59,600
OK.

2
00:0:59,600-->00:1:1,600
Do you know how to play charades?

3
00:1:1,600-->00:1:5,600
Frank, you've never played charades? Frank

4
00:1:5,600-->00:1:8,600
Nope.

5
00:1:8,600-->00:1:10,600
Carl, you're sure you've never played? Carl

6
00:1:10,600-->00:1:16,600
OK, Betty, Tim, and Frank.

7
00:1:16,600-->00:1:17,600
We're going to play charades.

8
00:1:17,600-->00:1:20,600
Frank, you can learn as we go. Frank

9
00:1:20,600-->00:1:21,600
And, Carl, you join in at any time.

10
00:1:21,600-->00:1:24,600
OK, let me think.

11
00:1:24,600-->00:1:28,600
OK, I've got one.

12
00:1:28,600-->00:1:40,600
All right.

13
00:1:40,600-->00:1:45,600
A movie!

14
00:1:45,600-->00:1:46,600
A movie!

15
00:1:46,600-->00:1:47,600
Right.

16
00:1:47,600-->00:1:48,600
A movie.

17
00:1:48,600-->00:1:49,600
OK.

18
00:1:49,600-->00:1:54,600
Six words.

19
00:1:54,600-->00:1:55,600
It has six words.

20
00:1:55,600-->00:1:57,600
That's easy.

21
00:1:57,600-->00:1:58,600
I can play.

22
00:1:58,600-->00:1:58,600
Good. OK.

23
00:1:58,600-->00:2:2,600
We've got a movie.

24
00:2:2,600-->00:2:2,600
The title ...

25
00:2:2,600-->00:2:3,600
Six words.

26
00:2:3,600-->00:2:4,600
Right.

27
00:2:4,600-->00:2:6,600
First word ...

28
00:2:6,600-->00:2:9,600
Sounds like.

29
00:2:9,600-->00:2:10,600
Sounds like ...

30
00:2:10,600-->00:2:12,600
You got that part right.

31
00:2:12,600-->00:2:13,600
Yes.

32
00:2:13,600-->00:2:16,600
Sounds like ...

33
00:2:16,600-->00:2:19,600
Sounds like what?

34
00:2:19,600-->00:2:21,600
Sounds like no.

35
00:2:21,600-->00:2:23,600
Absolutely right, Frank.

36
00:2:23,600-->00:2:25,600
Sounds like no.

37
00:2:25,600-->00:2:26,600
OK.

38
00:2:26,600-->00:2:28,600
We've got a movie.

39
00:2:28,600-->00:2:30,600
Six words.

40
00:2:30,600-->00:2:32,600
The first word sounds like no.

41
00:2:32,600-->00:2:36,600
Row. Row. Row

42
00:2:36,600-->00:2:37,600
Go. Go

43
00:2:37,600-->00:2:39,600
Nope.

44
00:2:39,600-->00:2:41,600
Show. Show

45
00:2:41,600-->00:2:43,600
That's it--show.

46
00:2:43,600-->00:2:45,600
No ... OK ...

47
00:2:45,600-->00:2:53,600
Snow.

48
00:2:53,600-->00:2:55,600
Absolutely right, Betty.

49
00:2:55,600-->00:2:58,600
Sounds like no -- snow.

50
00:2:58,600-->00:3:1,600
OK, a movie. Six words.

51
00:3:1,600-->00:3:3,600
The first word is snow.

52
00:3:3,600-->00:3:5,600
This is fun.

53
00:3:5,600-->00:3:7,600
Oh, OK.

54
00:3:7,600-->00:3:10,600
The fifth word.

55
00:3:10,600-->00:3:12,600
Right, fifth word.

56
00:3:12,600-->00:3:14,600
Seven?

57
00:3:14,600-->00:3:17,600
Absolutely right.

58
00:3:17,600-->00:3:18,600
Very good.

59
00:3:18,600-->00:3:18,600
The fifth word is seven.

60
00:3:18,600-->00:3:20,600
OK, we've got a movie.

61
00:3:20,600-->00:3:22,600
The first word is snow.

62
00:3:22,600-->00:3:25,600
Fifth word, seven.

63
00:3:25,600-->00:3:26,600
I got it!

64
00:3:26,600-->00:3:27,600
I got it!

65
00:3:27,600-->00:3:30,600
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs

66
00:3:30,600-->00:3:36,600
I got it.

67
00:3:36,600-->00:3:38,600
I got it.

68
00:3:38,600-->00:3:40,600
Frank, you got it. Frank

69
00:3:40,600-->00:3:42,600
Betty, you had it, but you didn't say it. Betty

70
00:3:42,600-->00:3:43,600
I knew it.

71
00:3:43,600-->00:3:47,600
Carl, now you know charades. Carl

72
00:3:47,600-->00:3:48,600
Why don't you join us?

73
00:3:48,600-->00:3:50,600
I don't like charades.

74
00:3:50,600-->00:3:52,600
It's for babies.

75
00:3:52,600-->00:3:53,600
Oh, I like it.

76
00:3:53,600-->00:3:56,600
Well, they're babies.

77
00:3:56,600-->00:3:58,600
You're a sore loser.

78
00:3:58,600-->00:3:59,600
Yeah.

79
00:3:59,600-->00:4:0,600
No arguing.

80
00:4:0,600-->00:4:1,600
Save your voices.

81
00:4:1,600-->00:4:3,600
Between now and tomorrow

82
00:4:3,600-->00:4:5,600
you're all going to have your tonsils out.

83
00:4:5,600-->00:4:6,600
And you won't be able to speak for a while.

84
00:4:6,600-->00:4:8,600
So save your voices till then.

85
00:4:8,600-->00:4:10,600
Hi, gang. Hi, everybody.

86
00:4:10,600-->00:4:13,600
Well, what's going on?

87
00:4:13,600-->00:4:15,600
I sure I am glad to see you, Dr. Stewart.

88
00:4:15,600-->00:4:16,600
This is a rough group.

89
00:4:16,600-->00:4:19,600
I didn't want to play charades,

90
00:4:19,600-->00:4:20,600
so they're angry at me.

91
00:4:20,600-->00:4:23,600
Why don't you want to play?

92
00:4:23,600-->00:4:25,600
Because I don't want to be here.

93
00:4:25,600-->00:4:27,600
I don't want my tonsils out.

94
00:4:27,600-->00:4:28,600
Why not?

95
00:4:28,600-->00:4:30,600
Because my birthday is tomorrow.

96
00:4:30,600-->00:4:33,600
My mother promised me a birthday party with a clown.

97
00:4:33,600-->00:4:35,600
But you can have one when you go home, Carl.

98
00:4:35,600-->00:4:38,600
But my birthday is tomorrow.

99
00:4:38,600-->00:4:40,600
I'm sorry, Carl.

100
00:4:40,600-->00:4:43,600
Carl, you'll have your party when you go home, Carl

101
00:4:43,600-->00:4:45,600
But it won't be on my birthday!

102
00:4:45,600-->00:4:50,600
And you promised me a surprise.
