00:2:51,600-->00:2:55,600
Two weeks. I said I could do it in two weeks, and I did it.

2
00:2:55,600-->00:2:58,600
The pictures you've taken are fabulous, Richard.

3
00:2:58,600-->00:3:0,600
Mr. Carlson will love them.

4
00:3:0,600-->00:3:1,600
Monday morning.

5
00:3:1,600-->00:3:4,600
I'm going to show him the photos on Monday morning.

6
00:3:4,600-->00:3:5,600
I can't wait!

7
00:3:5,600-->00:3:13,600
I'm very proud of you. You really did a beautiful job.

8
00:3:13,600-->00:3:19,600
I know he will love the new photographs for your book.

9
00:3:19,600-->00:3:22,600
Yeah. I really did do a good job, didn't I?

10
00:3:22,600-->00:3:27,600
Hey, you know? There's still some film left on this roll,

11
00:3:27,600-->00:3:30,600
and there's one person I haven't photographed in a long time.

12
00:3:30,600-->00:3:31,600
Who?

13
00:3:31,600-->00:3:32,600
You.

14
00:3:32,600-->00:3:35,600
Richard! I haven't brushed my hair.

15
00:3:35,600-->00:3:37,600
You look great!

16
00:3:37,600-->00:3:39,600
It's not fair, Richard. I'm not even ready.

17
00:3:39,600-->00:3:46,600
Oh, that's wonderful! That's wonderful!

18
00:3:46,600-->00:4:13,600
Wonderful!

19
00:4:13,600-->00:4:14,600
Thanks.

20
00:4:14,600-->00:4:15,600
Fabulous!

21
00:4:15,600-->00:4:16,600
Thanks.

22
00:4:16,600-->00:4:19,600
Terrific!

23
00:4:19,600-->00:4:21,600
Thanks.

24
00:4:21,600-->00:4:23,600
They get better and better.

25
00:4:23,600-->00:4:25,600
Thanks a lot.

26
00:4:25,600-->00:4:29,600
This is sensational!

27
00:4:29,600-->00:4:31,600
Yeah. Thanks.

28
00:4:31,600-->00:4:36,600
What a job! Good work, Richard!

29
00:4:36,600-->00:4:38,600
I'm so glad you like them so much.

30
00:4:38,600-->00:4:42,600
Like them? They represent your best work.

31
00:4:42,600-->00:4:44,600
Really?

32
00:4:44,600-->00:4:45,600
Absolutely.

33
00:4:45,600-->00:4:52,600
Well... what do you think? Do I have my book?

34
00:4:52,600-->00:4:59,600
You do. You do. There's a book here.

35
00:4:59,600-->00:5:2,600
I'll have a contract

36
00:5:2,600-->00:5:3,600
and an advance payment waiting for you

37
00:5:3,600-->00:5:4,600
first thing in the morning.

38
00:5:4,600-->00:5:5,600
Thank you.

39
00:5:5,600-->00:5:7,600
And while you're here,

40
00:5:7,600-->00:5:9,600
I would like to introduce you to your editor.

41
00:5:9,600-->00:5:11,600
And I want you to meet the people in the art department.

42
00:5:11,600-->00:5:15,600
I'll set up an appointment with the marketing people.

43
00:5:15,600-->00:5:16,600
When do you think we'll be through?

44
00:5:16,600-->00:5:19,600
In about half an hour. Why?

45
00:5:19,600-->00:5:21,600
I can't wait to tell Marilyn!
