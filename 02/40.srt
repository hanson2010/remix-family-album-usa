1
00:2:4,600-->00:2:7,600
You like living in New York, don't you?

2
00:2:7,600-->00:2:8,600
Oh, I love it.

3
00:2:8,600-->00:2:9,600
It's so convenient.

4
00:2:9,600-->00:2:11,600
I can take the bus to work...

5
00:2:11,600-->00:2:12,600
or the subway...

6
00:2:12,600-->00:2:13,600
or a taxi.

7
00:2:13,600-->00:2:15,600
And there's so much to do.

8
00:2:15,600-->00:2:17,600
Lots of movie houses, and the theater.

9
00:2:17,600-->00:2:19,600
I know what you mean.

10
00:2:19,600-->00:2:21,600
I'd like to live in the city,

11
00:2:21,600-->00:2:23,600
but living in New Jersey and the suburbs

12
00:2:23,600-->00:2:24,600
is better for Michelle.

13
00:2:24,600-->00:2:26,600
Trees, grass.

14
00:2:26,600-->00:2:30,600
There's a lot of good things about suburban living.

15
00:2:30,600-->00:2:32,600
I grew up in Riverdale, remember?

16
00:2:32,600-->00:2:33,600
So I know.

17
00:2:33,600-->00:2:36,600
But, as a working woman,

18
00:2:36,600-->00:2:39,600
I think New York has all the conveniences,

19
00:2:39,600-->00:2:41,600
including the best tomatoes.

20
00:2:41,600-->00:2:47,600
The truth is, I'd like to live in the city.

21
00:2:47,600-->00:2:49,600
Michelle's the right age. Michelle

22
00:2:49,600-->00:2:51,600
There are lots of things for her here.

23
00:2:51,600-->00:2:53,600
You're right, Harry.

24
00:2:53,600-->00:2:55,600
Today is the perfect example.

25
00:2:55,600-->00:2:58,600
Michelle and her friends are at the aquarium in Brooklyn.

26
00:2:58,600-->00:3:0,600
They come back here for lunch,

27
00:3:0,600-->00:3:3,600
then go uptown to the Museum of Natural History.

28
00:3:3,600-->00:3:5,600
There's so much for young people to see and do.

29
00:3:5,600-->00:3:7,600
It's just incredible!

30
00:3:7,600-->00:3:8,600
Not just for young people.

31
00:3:8,600-->00:3:9,600
What about me?

32
00:3:9,600-->00:3:10,600
I've never been to the aquarium

33
00:3:10,600-->00:3:12,600
or the Museum of Natural History. Have you?

34
00:3:12,600-->00:3:14,600
Oh yes, Harry.

35
00:3:14,600-->00:3:15,600
My mother and father

36
00:3:15,600-->00:3:17,600
often took us somewhere in the city on the weekends.

37
00:3:17,600-->00:3:19,600
Dad was a busy doctor,

38
00:3:19,600-->00:3:21,600
but he usually managed to squeeze a Sunday in

39
00:3:21,600-->00:3:23,600
with Richard, Robbie, and me.

40
00:3:23,600-->00:3:26,600
I used to love to go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

41
00:3:26,600-->00:3:27,600
I've been there several times.

42
00:3:27,600-->00:3:28,600
Twice with Michelle.

43
00:3:28,600-->00:3:32,600
You ought to think about spending more time with Michelle

44
00:3:32,600-->00:3:34,600
at all the great places in the city.

45
00:3:34,600-->00:3:36,600
Well, perhaps,

46
00:3:36,600-->00:3:40,600
you'll help me select some of the great places.

47
00:3:40,600-->00:3:42,600
And perhaps, you'll join us?

48
00:3:42,600-->00:3:47,600
Perhaps I will.

49
00:3:47,600-->00:3:54,600
Well, there we are.

50
00:3:54,600-->00:3:56,600
All set for lunch, Harry.

51
00:3:56,600-->00:3:57,600
It looks inviting.

52
00:3:57,600-->00:3:59,600
I wish Michelle and her friends would get here.

53
00:3:59,600-->00:4:0,600
I'm starving, aren't you?

54
00:4:0,600-->00:4:3,600
I can't wait to take a bite of the pumpernickel.

55
00:4:3,600-->00:4:5,600
It smells so delicious.

56
00:4:5,600-->00:4:7,600
Coming! Coming!

57
00:4:7,600-->00:4:12,600
Who is it?

58
00:4:12,600-->00:4:14,600
Michelle.

59
00:4:14,600-->00:4:15,600
It's us, Susan.

60
00:4:15,600-->00:4:16,600
Come in, Michelle,

61
00:4:16,600-->00:4:17,600
and bring your friends along.

62
00:4:17,600-->00:4:18,600
We're on the fifth floor.

63
00:4:18,600-->00:4:20,600
Oh, you've been here before.

64
00:4:20,600-->00:4:25,600
Susan,

65
00:4:25,600-->00:4:30,600
I really appreciate

66
00:4:30,600-->00:4:31,600
your doing this for Michelle and her friends.

67
00:4:31,600-->00:4:32,600
Oh, please, Harry.

68
00:4:32,600-->00:4:33,600
It's nothing.

69
00:4:33,600-->00:4:36,600
I'm not just doing it for Michelle.

70
00:4:36,600-->00:4:38,600
I'm doing it for you.

71
00:4:38,600-->00:4:41,600
Thank you.

72
00:4:41,600-->00:4:47,600
I'm doing it for us, Harry.

73
00:4:47,600-->00:4:49,600
Well,

74
00:4:49,600-->00:4:52,600
it's... it's important for Michelle to see us together more often.

75
00:4:52,600-->00:4:53,600
That's true.

76
00:4:53,600-->00:4:56,600
It's important

77
00:4:56,600-->00:4:58,600
for Michelle and me to get to know each other better.

78
00:4:58,600-->00:5:2,600
That's important for us.

79
00:5:2,600-->00:5:6,600
That makes me feel good.

80
00:5:6,600-->00:5:8,600
What, Harry?

81
00:5:8,600-->00:5:9,600
What makes you feel good?

82
00:5:9,600-->00:5:11,600
Well, that you care about Michelle,

83
00:5:11,600-->00:5:12,600
that you care about me, and

84
00:5:12,600-->00:5:15,600
that you care about us.

85
00:5:15,600-->00:5:19,600
Well, Harry, that's because I do.

86
00:5:19,600-->00:5:22,600
I do care.

87
00:5:22,600-->00:5:26,600
They'll be here any minute.

88
00:5:26,600-->00:5:33,600
Susan, I'd like to continue this conversation later.

89
00:5:33,600-->00:5:35,600
Of course, Harry.

90
00:5:35,600-->00:5:39,600
We'll finish the conversation when they go to the museum.

91
00:5:39,600-->00:5:41,600
I'd like that.

92
00:5:41,600-->00:5:43,600
So would I.
