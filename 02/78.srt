00:1:2,600-->00:1:4,600
What's this?

2
00:1:4,600-->00:1:5,600
Read it.

3
00:1:5,600-->00:1:8,600
I can't.

4
00:1:8,600-->00:1:10,600
Would you read it, Marilyn?

00:1:10,600-->00:1:16,600

Oh, Richard, it's wonderful!

12
00:1:29,600-->00:1:31,600
Congratulations!

13
00:1:31,600-->00:1:36,600
Wow! I'm overwhelmed.

14
00:1:36,600-->00:1:39,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:1:39,600-->00:1:43,600
if I may have your attention for a moment, please?

16
00:1:43,600-->00:1:47,600
I hope you're all enjoying the exhibition.

17
00:1:47,600-->00:1:49,600
I know that I am.

18
00:1:49,600-->00:1:52,600
And I would like to introduce the young man

19
00:1:52,600-->00:1:54,600
who spent the last five years

20
00:1:54,600-->00:1:56,600

Mr. Richard Stewart. Richard Stewarrt

23
00:2:3,600-->00:2:14,600

24
00:2:14,600-->00:2:15,600
Hello.

25
00:2:15,600-->00:2:19,600
I want to thank all of you for coming here tonight.

26
00:2:19,600-->00:2:22,600
I'd like to thank Harvey Carlson

27
00:2:22,600-->00:2:23,600
for his faith in my project.

28
00:2:23,600-->00:2:27,600
But most of all,

29
00:2:27,600-->00:2:29,600
I would like to thank my family

30
00:2:29,600-->00:2:34,600
for their love and support all through this adventure.

31
00:2:34,600-->00:2:36,600
Thank you.

32
00:2:36,600-->00:2:44,600

33
00:2:44,600-->00:2:49,600
Oh, I'm glad that's over.

34
00:2:49,600-->00:2:50,600
Would you mind?

35
00:2:50,600-->00:2:52,600
Oh, not at all.

36
00:2:52,600-->00:3:4,600

37
00:3:4,600-->00:3:5,600
Thanks.

38
00:3:5,600-->00:3:6,600
Our pleasure.

39
00:3:6,600-->00:3:7,600
Hope it wins a Pulitzer Prize.

40
00:3:7,600-->00:3:9,600
I'll settle for an "A" in my photography course.

41
00:3:9,600-->00:3:20,600
Ah, Richard, Marilyn, I want you to meet John O'Neill.

42
00:3:20,600-->00:3:21,600
Oh, how do you do?

43
00:3:21,600-->00:3:22,600
Nice to meet you.

44
00:3:22,600-->00:3:25,600
I've been looking forward to meeting your husband, Mrs. Stewart.

45
00:3:25,600-->00:3:28,600
I'm really impressed by your show.

46
00:3:28,600-->00:3:29,600
Thank you.

47
00:3:29,600-->00:3:31,600
In fact, I'd like your autograph.

48
00:3:31,600-->00:3:32,600
Oh, well, really ...

49
00:3:32,600-->00:3:34,600
On a contract.

50
00:3:34,600-->00:3:38,600
What's this about, Harvey?

51
00:3:38,600-->00:3:41,600
Mr. O'Neill is the publisher of several magazines. O'Neill

52
00:3:41,600-->00:3:44,600
Of course. I've seen you on television.

53
00:3:44,600-->00:3:47,600
Mr. O'Neill was so impressed with your work O'Neill

54
00:3:47,600-->00:3:49,600
that he wants to develop it into a magazine concept.

55
00:3:49,600-->00:3:53,600
Well, that sounds very exciting,

56
00:3:53,600-->00:3:56,600
but where would I fit into the plan?

57
00:3:56,600-->00:3:59,600
I'd like you to be the photo editor of the magazine.

58
00:3:59,600-->00:4:1,600
Oh, Richard, how exciting!

59
00:4:1,600-->00:4:3,600
It's a wonderful opportunity, Richard.

60
00:4:3,600-->00:4:7,600
Hold on. Wait a minute, please.

61
00:4:7,600-->00:4:10,600
What's the problem, Richard?

62
00:4:10,600-->00:4:15,600
The problem is that I'm a photographer, not an editor.

63
00:4:15,600-->00:4:17,600
I like what I do.

64
00:4:17,600-->00:4:19,600
In fact, I love what I do ...

65
00:4:19,600-->00:4:22,600
which is going out with a camera and a roll of film

66
00:4:22,600-->00:4:24,600
and seeing the wonder of humanity.

67
00:4:24,600-->00:4:27,600
Now, I appreciate your offer,

68
00:4:27,600-->00:4:30,600
but I've worked so hard on Family Album, U.S.A.,

69
00:4:30,600-->00:4:33,600
and I'm giving some thought to a new book on a different subject.

70
00:4:33,600-->00:4:35,600
I'm flattered,

71
00:4:35,600-->00:4:38,600
but I enjoy taking pictures, and I want to continue doing that.

72
00:4:38,600-->00:4:42,600
Thank you,

73
00:4:42,600-->00:4:45,600
but I'm happy being a photographer.

74
00:4:45,600-->00:4:47,600
I understand, Richard.

75
00:4:47,600-->00:4:51,600
Richard, I know your next book will be a success. Richard

76
00:4:51,600-->00:4:53,600
Congratulations!

77
00:4:53,600-->00:4:54,600
Thanks.

78
00:4:54,600-->00:5:2,600
You're a real Stewart!

79
00:5:2,600-->00:5:4,600
Thanks.
