00:0:39,600-->00:0:42,600
I'm so glad everyone is asleep.

2
00:0:42,600-->00:0:45,600
I thought Max would be crying, and everybody would be awake.

3
00:0:45,600-->00:0:46,600
What did I tell you?

4
00:0:46,600-->00:0:47,600
Nothing to worry about.

5
00:0:47,600-->00:0:49,600
I'm sure everything is fine.

6
00:0:49,600-->00:0:51,600
My mother knows all there is to know

7
00:0:51,600-->00:0:53,600
about taking care of babies, I assure you.

8
00:0:53,600-->00:0:55,600
Let's put some of this stuff away and then take off.

9
00:0:55,600-->00:0:57,600
We've got a forty-minute drive into the city.

10
00:0:57,600-->00:1:6,600
Welcome home--

11
00:1:6,600-->00:1:8,600
and I do mean welcome home.

12
00:1:8,600-->00:1:14,600
Something wrong?

13
00:1:14,600-->00:1:17,600
Oh, nothing's wrong, Richard.

14
00:1:17,600-->00:1:19,600
Believe me, Max is fine.

15
00:1:19,600-->00:1:23,600
But his teeth hurt, and he just can't get to sleep, poor dear.

16
00:1:23,600-->00:1:28,600
Neither can you.

17
00:1:28,600-->00:1:31,600
Oh, I feel so bad.

18
00:1:31,600-->00:1:33,600
Oh, I'm fine.

19
00:1:33,600-->00:1:34,600
How was your weekend?

20
00:1:34,600-->00:1:36,600
We had a great time, Mom.

21
00:1:36,600-->00:1:38,600
It was wonderful.

22
00:1:38,600-->00:1:39,600
The weather couldn't have been better.

23
00:1:39,600-->00:1:42,600
It was nice here, too.

24
00:1:42,600-->00:1:44,600
Did you get a chance to get outside at all?

25
00:1:44,600-->00:1:45,600
Oh, yes.

26
00:1:45,600-->00:1:47,600
Grandpa helped me yesterday afternoon.

27
00:1:47,600-->00:1:49,600
I went to the supermarket to get a few things,

28
00:1:49,600-->00:1:52,600
and I stayed out an extra half hour.

29
00:1:52,600-->00:1:54,600
The village was filled with people--the weather was so nice.

30
00:1:54,600-->00:1:57,600
Harry's a professional camper, Mom. Harry

31
00:1:57,600-->00:1:59,600
He knows all there is to know,

32
00:1:59,600-->00:2:1,600
and he made the weekend very easy for us to enjoy.

33
00:2:1,600-->00:2:3,600
Come on. You all helped.

34
00:2:3,600-->00:2:5,600
You were wonderful, Harry!

35
00:2:5,600-->00:2:11,600
Why don't you go to your room, Mom, and get some sleep.

36
00:2:11,600-->00:2:13,600
Oh, I'm fine.

37
00:2:13,600-->00:2:15,600
Tell me more about your weekend.

38
00:2:15,600-->00:2:17,600
Did you do anything special?

39
00:2:17,600-->00:2:20,600
Lots of special country things.

40
00:2:20,600-->00:2:22,600
We picked flowers.

41
00:2:22,600-->00:2:24,600
And we brought some home for you.

42
00:2:24,600-->00:2:28,600
It was so nice to be out in the country.

43
00:2:28,600-->00:2:31,600
They smell wonderful.

44
00:2:31,600-->00:2:33,600
Everything smelled so special.

45
00:2:33,600-->00:2:36,600
It would have been great if we had been able to bottle the smells.

46
00:2:36,600-->00:2:39,600
It would be a great business if you could do that.

47
00:2:39,600-->00:2:41,600
Oh!

48
00:2:41,600-->00:2:44,600
Uh, we're home now, Ellen.

49
00:2:44,600-->00:2:46,600
We'll take care of it.

50
00:2:46,600-->00:2:48,600
I'll take care of it.

51
00:2:48,600-->00:2:51,600
Let's see if it works.

52
00:2:51,600-->00:2:52,600
What's that?

53
00:2:52,600-->00:2:55,600
A little special country music.

54
00:2:55,600-->00:2:58,600
I think we'd better head home.

55
00:2:58,600-->00:3:0,600
It's getting late, and we have a bit of a drive.

56
00:3:0,600-->00:3:3,600
Well, all your things are inside.

57
00:3:3,600-->00:3:4,600
There's your sleeping bag.

58
00:3:4,600-->00:3:6,600
Oh, thanks, Harry.

59
00:3:6,600-->00:3:9,600
Say good-bye to Richard.

60
00:3:9,600-->00:3:10,600
We'll call you all tomorrow night.

61
00:3:10,600-->00:3:12,600
Good-bye.

62
00:3:12,600-->00:3:14,600
Bye, Mom.

63
00:3:14,600-->00:3:24,600
I'm so tired I think I'm overtired.

64
00:3:24,600-->00:3:28,600
I don't know if I can get to sleep.

65
00:3:28,600-->00:3:39,600
Max has stopped crying. Max

66
00:3:39,600-->00:3:43,600
Yes. It works!

67
00:3:43,600-->00:3:45,600
It works!

68
00:3:45,600-->00:3:48,600
What works?

69
00:3:48,600-->00:3:50,600
This.

70
00:3:50,600-->00:4:1,600
Oh. Oh, where did you get that?

71
00:4:1,600-->00:4:6,600
It sounds so nice.

72
00:4:6,600-->00:4:15,600
I think I'm falling asleep.

73
00:4:15,600-->00:4:17,600
Like Max did.

74
00:4:17,600-->00:4:13,600
Good night.

75
00:4:13,600-->00:4:29,600
Sounds of the country.

76
00:4:29,600-->00:4:33,600
The soothing sounds of the country.
