00:1:16,600-->00:1:19,600
Hi. I'm Malcolm Stewart.

2
00:1:19,600-->00:1:20,600
John Marchetta.

3
00:1:20,600-->00:1:23,600
Sit down, sit down.

4
00:1:23,600-->00:1:26,600
Susan has told me a great deal about you.

5
00:1:26,600-->00:1:28,600
She says you're quite a man.

6
00:1:28,600-->00:1:29,600
She says

7
00:1:29,600-->00:1:32,600
a lot of wonderful things about you too, Mr. Stewart.

8
00:1:32,600-->00:1:35,600
That's always nice to hear, Mr. Marchetta.

9
00:1:35,600-->00:1:36,600
Call me John.

10
00:1:36,600-->00:1:38,600
May I call you Malcolm?

11
00:1:38,600-->00:1:40,600
Let's talk business.

12
00:1:40,600-->00:1:42,600
That's music to my ears.

13
00:1:42,600-->00:1:44,600
I understand

14
00:1:44,600-->00:1:46,600
you used to be in the construction business.

15
00:1:46,600-->00:1:48,600
Yup. Forty-three years.

16
00:1:48,600-->00:1:51,600
Here's a brief description

17
00:1:51,600-->00:1:54,600
of forty-three years of on-the-job training.

18
00:1:54,600-->00:1:59,600
That is some history!

19
00:1:59,600-->00:2:2,600
You're a valuable asset, Malcolm.

20
00:2:2,600-->00:2:3,600
Very valuable.

21
00:2:3,600-->00:2:4,600
Thank you.

22
00:2:4,600-->00:2:8,600
Yup. Forty-three years.

23
00:2:8,600-->00:2:12,600
Half that time in my own construction company.

24
00:2:12,600-->00:2:16,600
Big jobs - factories, shopping malls.

25
00:2:16,600-->00:2:18,600
That kind of thing.

26
00:2:18,600-->00:2:20,600
Then you retired.

27
00:2:20,600-->00:2:21,600
Yes.

28
00:2:21,600-->00:2:23,600
After my wife died,

29
00:2:23,600-->00:2:26,600
and I felt I should spend more time

30
00:2:26,600-->00:2:28,600
with my children and grandchildren.

31
00:2:28,600-->00:2:30,600
I lived in Florida,

32
00:2:30,600-->00:2:32,600
and they lived in New York.

33
00:2:32,600-->00:2:33,600
I understand.

34
00:2:33,600-->00:2:35,600
My dautghter Cami lives in New York.

35
00:2:35,600-->00:2:36,600
I like being near her.

36
00:2:36,600-->00:2:39,600
When I came here,

37
00:2:39,600-->00:2:41,600
I planned to take a few months off.

38
00:2:41,600-->00:2:46,600
Relax with the family and then look for some work.

39
00:2:46,600-->00:2:48,600
Put my experience on the line...

40
00:2:48,600-->00:2:51,600
but, unfortunately,

41
00:2:51,600-->00:2:54,600
there isn't any work for a retired person my age.

42
00:2:54,600-->00:2:56,600
Sometimes there is,

43
00:2:56,600-->00:2:58,600
and sometimes there isn't.

44
00:2:58,600-->00:3:0,600
Well, I'm involved with an organization,

45
00:3:0,600-->00:3:2,600
and we're trying to resolve that problem.

46
00:3:2,600-->00:3:4,600
What's that?

47
00:3:4,600-->00:3:7,600
TOPS. TOPS.

48
00:3:7,600-->00:3:11,600
T-O-P-S means Talented Older People's Society.

49
00:3:11,600-->00:3:13,600
I'd like to be a member.

50
00:3:13,600-->00:3:15,600
How much are the dues?

51
00:3:15,600-->00:3:17,600
There are no dues.

52
00:3:17,600-->00:3:21,600
The organization serves major companies in this city.

53
00:3:21,600-->00:3:23,600
Why?

54
00:3:23,600-->00:3:26,600
Because our members are men and women like you.

55
00:3:26,600-->00:3:29,600
Experienced, talented, retired.

56
00:3:29,600-->00:3:32,600
But our members want to go out there

57
00:3:32,600-->00:3:33,600
and use their talents.

58
00:3:33,600-->00:3:34,600
They want to work.

59
00:3:34,600-->00:3:37,600
That is fantastic, John!

60
00:3:37,600-->00:3:40,600
I've got an idea for you, Malcolm.

61
00:3:40,600-->00:3:42,600
Just fill out this form for me.

62
00:3:42,600-->00:3:45,600
It'll only take a few minutes.

63
00:3:45,600-->00:3:46,600
Sit right here,

64
00:3:46,600-->00:3:47,600
and do it while I talk to my secretary.

65
00:3:47,600-->00:3:50,600
When I get back, we'll talk about my new factory.

66
00:3:50,600-->00:3:53,600
My company is a member of TOPS.

67
00:3:53,600-->00:3:56,600
So I try hard to find opportunities for people like you.

68
00:3:56,600-->00:3:57,600
Malcolm. Malcolm

69
00:3:57,600-->00:3:59,600
And when I see an opportunity,

70
00:3:59,600-->00:4:0,600
I can act on it.

71
00:4:0,600-->00:4:5,600
Well, I can use your brainpower on the job right now.

72
00:4:5,600-->00:4:8,600
Have you got time this morning

73
00:4:8,600-->00:4:11,600
to go over to the construction site with me?

74
00:4:11,600-->00:4:13,600
I'd like to have you meet my foreman,

75
00:4:13,600-->00:4:15,600
get some background on the job.

76
00:4:15,600-->00:4:16,600
I've got plenty of time.

77
00:4:16,600-->00:4:18,600
I'll be right back.

78
00:4:18,600-->00:4:20,600
We'll go over to the job site together.

79
00:4:20,600-->00:5:1,600

80
00:5:1,600-->00:5:6,600
Malcolm, you worked on the Spaceport project?

81
00:5:6,600-->00:5:8,600
My company was the contractor.

82
00:5:8,600-->00:5:10,600
I built the theater there

83
00:5:10,600-->00:5:12,600
with my own two hands, practically.

84
00:5:12,600-->00:5:14,600
I understand.

85
00:5:14,600-->00:5:15,600
Well,

86
00:5:15,600-->00:5:17,600
I'm glad to see you two guys getting along so well

87
00:5:17,600-->00:5:19,600
because, Danny,

88
00:5:19,600-->00:5:20,600
Malcolm is on the TOPS team.

89
00:5:20,600-->00:5:22,600
He's going to be working with you for a while.

90
00:5:22,600-->00:5:25,600
His experience will be valuable to both of us.

91
00:5:25,600-->00:5:27,600
Welcome aboard, Malcolm!

92
00:5:27,600-->00:5:29,600
I'm going back to my office.

93
00:5:29,600-->00:5:31,600
Give me a call later, Malcolm.

94
00:5:31,600-->00:5:33,600
I'll tell you the time and date of the next TOPS meeting.

95
00:5:33,600-->00:5:35,600
I'd like you to meet the group.

96
00:5:35,600-->00:5:36,600
I will, John.

97
00:5:36,600-->00:5:38,600
And again, thanks.

98
00:5:38,600-->00:5:39,600
No. thank you.

99
00:5:39,600-->00:5:41,600
And thank Susan.

100
00:5:41,600-->00:5:45,600
He's quite a man.

101
00:5:45,600-->00:5:47,600
A real inspiration for me.

102
00:5:47,600-->00:5:50,600
OK, Danny.

103
00:5:50,600-->00:5:52,600
I know you didn't expect to have me around,

104
00:5:52,600-->00:5:55,600
but I think I can be of some help to you.

105
00:5:55,600-->00:5:56,600
Let me tell you something, Malcolm.

106
00:5:56,600-->00:5:57,600
With your background and experience,

107
00:5:57,600-->00:5:59,600
I can learn something

108
00:5:59,600-->00:6:1,600
and I do need some advice on a difficult problem.

109
00:6:1,600-->00:6:3,600
Let me show you this.

110
00:6:3,600-->00:6:10,600
I don't want to give you a final opinion

111
00:6:10,600-->00:6:13,600
without studying these building plans more carefully.

112
00:6:13,600-->00:6:16,600
But a simple solution might be

113
00:6:16,600-->00:6:19,600
to move the air-conditioning units

114
00:6:19,600-->00:6:22,600
instead of redesigning the entire system.

115
00:6:22,600-->00:6:25,600
It might be simpler and less expensive .

116
00:6:25,600-->00:6:28,600
You just earned your weight in gold, Malcolm.

117
00:6:28,600-->00:6:31,600
Welcome aboard!

118
00:6:31,600-->00:6:36,600
It all happened so quickly!

119
00:6:36,600-->00:6:38,600
I can't believe it!

120
00:6:38,600-->00:6:40,600
I'm glad Mr. Marchetta was so helpful.

121
00:6:40,600-->00:6:42,600
He was more than helpful.

122
00:6:42,600-->00:6:45,600
He actually took me to meet his foreman.

123
00:6:45,600-->00:6:47,600
I'm thrilled for you, Grandpa.

124
00:6:47,600-->00:6:51,600
I don't know how to thank you, Susan.

125
00:6:51,600-->00:6:53,600
You're a wonderful granddaughter.

126
00:6:53,600-->00:6:55,600
It's good to see you so happy.

127
00:6:55,600-->00:6:57,600
I'll be at the construction site tomorrow.

128
00:6:57,600-->00:7:0,600
What are you doing tomorrow night?

129
00:7:0,600-->00:7:1,600
I'm not doing anything.

130
00:7:1,600-->00:7:2,600
Why?

131
00:7:2,600-->00:7:4,600
How about a date with your grandfather?

132
00:7:4,600-->00:7:6,600
I owe you a good steak dinner.

133
00:7:6,600-->00:7:8,600
I'll accept.

134
00:7:8,600-->00:7:9,600
Tomorrow night.

135
00:7:9,600-->00:7:11,600
You and me. Dinner.

136
00:7:11,600-->00:7:13,600
What time?

137
00:7:13,600-->00:7:15,600
I'll pick you up here at seven .

138
00:7:15,600-->00:7:16,600
Is that OK?

139
00:7:16,600-->00:7:17,600
I can't wait!

140
00:7:17,600-->00:7:18,600
And you can tell me

141
00:7:18,600-->00:7:21,600
all about your first full day back on the job.

142
00:7:21,600-->00:7:23,600
It's a deal!
