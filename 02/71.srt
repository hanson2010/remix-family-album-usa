1
00:1:1,600-->00:1:4,600
You ready for the next problem?

2
00:1:4,600-->00:1:6,600
You know what?

3
00:1:6,600-->00:1:8,600
I can't look at another number.

4
00:1:8,600-->00:1:9,600
How about a lemonade break?

5
00:1:9,600-->00:1:10,600
Sure.

6
00:1:10,600-->00:1:15,600
Oh, by the way,

7
00:1:15,600-->00:1:19,600
when is your plane reservation for your flight to Athens?

8
00:1:19,600-->00:1:22,600
Sunday. Why?

9
00:1:22,600-->00:1:24,600
Would you be able to come over Saturday night?

10
00:1:24,600-->00:1:26,600
Yes.

11
00:1:26,600-->00:1:28,600
I should be finished packing by then.

12
00:1:28,600-->00:1:31,600
My folks are giving me a little graduation party.

13
00:1:31,600-->00:1:32,600
Terrific!

14
00:1:32,600-->00:1:35,600
I'll pick you up.

15
00:1:35,600-->00:1:36,600
That isn't necessary.

16
00:1:36,600-->00:1:38,600
My dad's letting me borrow the car.

17
00:1:38,600-->00:1:42,600
Oh, well, that would be very nice.

18
00:1:42,600-->00:1:44,600
About eight o'clock?

19
00:1:44,600-->00:1:45,600
Eight o'clock is fine.

20
00:1:45,600-->00:1:47,600
Great! It's a date.

21
00:1:47,600-->00:1:49,600
Who's going to be there?

22
00:1:49,600-->00:1:53,600
Just my friend Mike and a few kids from school.

23
00:1:53,600-->00:1:56,600
I'm going to miss all of you.

24
00:1:56,600-->00:1:59,600
You've been like a second family to me.

25
00:1:59,600-->00:2:1,600
We're going to miss you.

26
00:2:1,600-->00:2:4,600
Maybe you could come to visit me in Greece?

27
00:2:4,600-->00:2:5,600
I'm counting on it.

28
00:2:5,600-->00:2:6,600
Wonderful!

29
00:2:6,600-->00:2:9,600
Are you excited about graduating from high school?

30
00:2:9,600-->00:2:13,600
Sure... and a little scared.

31
00:2:13,600-->00:2:14,600
Scared? Why?

32
00:2:14,600-->00:2:16,600
Aren't you a little scared?

33
00:2:16,600-->00:2:21,600
I was when I first came to the United States.

34
00:2:21,600-->00:2:23,600
I'd never been away from home,

35
00:2:23,600-->00:2:26,600
and I didn't know what it would be like.

36
00:2:26,600-->00:2:31,600
But then I found out that people are the same everywhere

37
00:2:31,600-->00:2:33,600
once you get to know them.

38
00:2:33,600-->00:2:35,600
I'm glad I got to know you.

39
00:2:35,600-->00:2:36,600
Thank you.

40
00:2:36,600-->00:2:41,600
I'm glad I got to know you, and your family.

41
00:2:41,600-->00:2:44,600
Wouldn't it be nice if we could skip the examinations

42
00:2:44,600-->00:2:46,600
and get right to the graduation party?

43
00:2:46,600-->00:2:48,600
It would be very nice.

44
00:2:48,600-->00:2:51,600
But that isn't the way it works.

45
00:2:51,600-->00:2:53,600
So... back to work.

46
00:2:53,600-->00:2:59,600
Good night, Robbie.

47
00:2:59,600-->00:3:0,600
Good night, Mrs. Stewart.

48
00:3:0,600-->00:3:1,600
Thank you for dinner.

49
00:3:1,600-->00:3:2,600
Good night, Alexandra.

50
00:3:2,600-->00:3:3,600
Will you be all right?

51
00:3:3,600-->00:3:5,600
Yes. The Molinas are waiting for me.

52
00:3:5,600-->00:3:7,600
Good night, Alexandra.

53
00:3:7,600-->00:3:10,600
I'll pick you up on Saturday night, OK?

54
00:3:10,600-->00:3:13,600
Yes.

55
00:3:13,600-->00:3:16,600
I have to run.

56
00:3:16,600-->00:3:24,600
Good night, Robbie.

57
00:3:24,600-->00:3:32,600
She's really a good friend, isn't she?

58
00:3:32,600-->00:3:34,600
Yeah.

59
00:3:34,600-->00:3:37,600
You are going to miss her.

60
00:3:37,600-->00:3:41,600
Am I going to miss her?

61
00:3:41,600-->00:3:43,600
That's what I said!

62
00:3:43,600-->00:3:46,600
You are going to miss her!

63
00:3:46,600-->00:3:49,600
I'm going to miss her,

64
00:3:49,600-->00:3:53,600
and my math teacher's going to miss her.

65
00:3:53,600-->00:3:56,600
Well, you can write to her.

66
00:3:56,600-->00:3:58,600
It's not the same.

67
00:4:58,600-->00:4:10,600

68
00:4:10,600-->00:4:12,600
How does that look, Rob?

69
00:4:12,600-->00:4:14,600
Great! Pass me the hammer.

70
00:4:14,600-->00:4:15,600
You got it!

71
00:4:15,600-->00:4:19,600
You're sure Alexandra's going to be surprised?

72
00:4:19,600-->00:4:20,600
Absolutely.

73
00:4:20,600-->00:4:23,600
She has no idea that the party is in her honor.

74
00:4:23,600-->00:4:25,600
Millie, did you bring the tapes for dancing?

75
00:4:25,600-->00:4:26,600
They're in my bag.

76
00:4:26,600-->00:4:27,600
What did you bring?

77
00:4:27,600-->00:4:28,600
Some rock 'n' roll.

78
00:4:28,600-->00:4:30,600
Perfect! Alexandra will love it!

79
00:4:30,600-->00:4:34,600
I can't wait to see her face when she walks in here tonight.

80
00:4:34,600-->00:4:36,600
What about the cake?

81
00:4:36,600-->00:4:38,600
My mom's decorating it right now.

82
00:4:38,600-->00:4:44,600
Robbie, there's a phone call for you.

83
00:4:44,600-->00:4:45,600
It's Alexandra.

84
00:4:45,600-->00:4:46,600
She sounds upset.

85
00:4:46,600-->00:4:47,600
OK.

86
00:4:47,600-->00:4:48,600
I'll take it in there.

87
00:4:48,600-->00:4:55,600
Hi, Alexandra.

88
00:4:55,600-->00:5:1,600
What? You what?

89
00:5:1,600-->00:5:5,600
Oh no!
