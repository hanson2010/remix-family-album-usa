1
00:0:35,600-->00:0:38,600
Thanks, Michelle.

2
00:0:38,600-->00:0:39,600
I hope you like it.

3
00:0:39,600-->00:0:52,600
Isn't this baby outfit adorable?

4
00:0:52,600-->00:0:55,600
With his name on it - "Max".

5
00:0:55,600-->00:0:58,600
Thanks so much, Harry and Michelle.

6
00:0:58,600-->00:1:0,600
We really appreciate it.

7
00:1:0,600-->00:1:1,600
I'm glad you like it.

8
00:1:1,600-->00:1:2,600
Michelle picked it out.

9
00:1:2,600-->00:1:4,600
Yes, I told Daddy to pick blue ones.

10
00:1:4,600-->00:1:6,600
Blue is for boys, and pink is for girls.

11
00:1:6,600-->00:1:8,600
And Max is some boy.

12
00:1:8,600-->00:1:11,600
He's a real Stewart.

13
00:1:11,600-->00:1:12,600
Right.

14
00:1:12,600-->00:1:15,600
That was so thoughtful of you, Michelle.

15
00:1:15,600-->00:1:17,600
Especially to pick it out in blue.

16
00:1:17,600-->00:1:21,600
Would you like to see baby Max, Michelle?

17
00:1:21,600-->00:1:23,600
Could she? Could we?

18
00:1:23,600-->00:1:24,600
Could I?

19
00:1:24,600-->00:1:26,600
Take them upstairs, Susan.

20
00:1:26,600-->00:1:29,600
Harry and Michelle can watch Max sleeping.

21
00:1:29,600-->00:1:31,600
Let's go.

22
00:1:31,600-->00:1:32,600
Come on, Michelle.

23
00:1:32,600-->00:1:33,600
Before Max wakes up.

24
00:1:33,600-->00:1:38,600
Will you please take this upstairs, Susan?

25
00:1:38,600-->00:1:39,600
Uh-huh.

26
00:1:39,600-->00:1:40,600
Thank you.

27
00:1:40,600-->00:1:47,600
Michelle is very grown up for a ten-year-old, huh?

28
00:1:47,600-->00:1:51,600
She's smart and sensitive for her age.

29
00:1:51,600-->00:1:54,600
Growing up without a mother is difficult.

30
00:1:54,600-->00:1:56,600
You mature quickly.

31
00:1:56,600-->00:2:0,600
Susan's like a mother to Michelle.

32
00:2:0,600-->00:2:3,600
They have a good relationship.

33
00:2:3,600-->00:2:10,600
Do you think Susan and Harry will get married?

34
00:2:10,600-->00:2:13,600
Yeah. You can count on it.

35
00:2:13,600-->00:2:18,600
I think so. Yes. They get along so well.

36
00:2:18,600-->00:2:20,600
I like him. He's good for Susan.

37
00:2:20,600-->00:2:23,600
He's a little quiet.

38
00:2:23,600-->00:2:27,600
It's hard to do anything but listen in this family.

39
00:2:27,600-->00:2:31,600
How can anybody get a word in around here?

40
00:2:31,600-->00:2:33,600
You're right, Ellen.

41
00:2:33,600-->00:2:34,600
Oh, really?

42
00:2:34,600-->00:2:36,600
It's the way it should be.

43
00:2:36,600-->00:2:38,600
The Stewarts are the Stewarts!

44
00:2:38,600-->00:2:39,600
They always were,

45
00:2:39,600-->00:2:40,600
and they always will be.

46
00:2:40,600-->00:2:41,600
Right!

47
00:2:41,600-->00:2:43,600
They've always got an opinion.

48
00:2:43,600-->00:2:45,600
Always got something to say.

49
00:2:45,600-->00:2:48,600
And now there's Max Stewart.

50
00:2:48,600-->00:2:51,600
and if he talks as loudly as he cries,

51
00:2:51,600-->00:2:53,600
we're all in for trouble.

52
00:2:53,600-->00:2:55,600
He's quiet now.

53
00:2:55,600-->00:2:58,600
Mmm-hmm. That's because he's sleeping.

54
00:2:58,600-->00:3:10,600
He's really cute.

55
00:3:10,600-->00:3:14,600
It's not necessary to whisper, Harry.

56
00:3:14,600-->00:3:15,600
A baby gets used to voices.

57
00:3:15,600-->00:3:17,600
I remember now.

58
00:3:17,600-->00:3:19,600
We always whispered when Michelle was born.

59
00:3:19,600-->00:3:22,600
And I didn't sleep well, Daddy told me.

60
00:3:22,600-->00:3:23,600
I never slept.

61
00:3:23,600-->00:3:24,600
And when I did,

62
00:3:24,600-->00:3:25,600
I woke up when I heard someone speak.

63
00:3:25,600-->00:3:27,600
I bet you were cute.

64
00:3:27,600-->00:3:28,600
She sure was.

65
00:3:28,600-->00:3:30,600
Not as cute as Max.

66
00:3:30,600-->00:3:33,600
He's like a little doll.

67
00:3:33,600-->00:3:46,600
Oh, good.

68
00:3:46,600-->00:3:49,600
Now I can help diaper him.

69
00:3:49,600-->00:3:51,600
Let's get Marilyn.

70
00:3:51,600-->00:3:55,600
What do you do when he cries like that?

71
00:3:55,600-->00:3:57,600
You pick him up.

72
00:3:57,600-->00:4:3,600
He's so little... so new.

73
00:4:3,600-->00:4:6,600
Let's call Marilyn.

74
00:4:6,600-->00:4:13,600
Time for a feeding and time for a diapering.

75
00:4:13,600-->00:4:38,600

76
00:4:38,600-->00:4:41,600
You're a real Stewart.
