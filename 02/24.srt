00:1:16,600-->00:1:21,600
It hurts, doesn't it?

2
00:1:21,600-->00:1:25,600
You'll feel better tomorrow, Betty, believe me.

3
00:1:25,600-->00:1:29,600
Only one day, and it won't hurt as much.

4
00:1:29,600-->00:1:31,600
Do you feel like eating?

5
00:1:31,600-->00:1:32,600
Having some dinner?

6
00:1:32,600-->00:1:36,600
Oh, don't look so sad.

7
00:1:36,600-->00:1:38,600
Let me tell you about your dinner.

8
00:1:38,600-->00:1:40,600
It's ice cream.

9
00:1:40,600-->00:1:41,600
Ice cream.

10
00:1:41,600-->00:1:43,600
All kinds of flavors.

11
00:1:43,600-->00:1:45,600
Chocolate.

12
00:1:45,600-->00:1:48,600
Strawberry?

13
00:1:48,600-->00:1:49,600
Vanilla?

14
00:1:49,600-->00:1:51,600
Vanilla, too?

15
00:1:51,600-->00:1:54,600
I see you're feeling better already, Betty.

16
00:1:54,600-->00:1:55,600
So you will have dinner?

17
00:1:55,600-->00:1:58,600
OK, honey, we'll see to it

18
00:1:58,600-->00:2:1,600
that you have strawberry and vanilla ice cream.

19
00:2:1,600-->00:2:3,600
Just rest now.

20
00:2:3,600-->00:2:5,600
You need some rest to help you get better quickly.

21
00:2:5,600-->00:2:12,600
Hi, Frank.

22
00:2:12,600-->00:2:16,600
How you doing?

23
00:2:16,600-->00:2:19,600
Oh, come on now.

24
00:2:19,600-->00:2:20,600
You're a big boy.

25
00:2:20,600-->00:2:22,600
It doesn't hurt that much, does it?

26
00:2:22,600-->00:2:27,600
Oh, I'm sorry it hurts so much,

27
00:2:27,600-->00:2:28,600
and you won't be able to have dinner.

28
00:2:28,600-->00:2:30,600
You're just going to have to have ice cream.

29
00:2:30,600-->00:2:34,600
Yes, ice cream.

30
00:2:34,600-->00:2:36,600
Lots of flavors.

31
00:2:36,600-->00:2:37,600
Want to hear them?

32
00:2:37,600-->00:2:39,600
Chocolate?

33
00:2:39,600-->00:2:41,600
Then chocolate it is.

34
00:2:41,600-->00:2:43,600
One scoop or two?

35
00:2:43,600-->00:2:45,600
Three scoops?

36
00:2:45,600-->00:2:47,600
Then three it will be.

37
00:2:47,600-->00:2:57,600
You want three scoops also?

38
00:2:57,600-->00:2:58,600
Chocolate, too?

39
00:2:58,600-->00:3:1,600
Well, I see you're feeling better.

40
00:3:1,600-->00:3:6,600
Well, at least you're acting like you feel better.

41
00:3:6,600-->00:3:10,600
Three scoops of chocolate ice cream for Tim coming up.

42
00:3:10,600-->00:3:18,600
Hi, Carl.

43
00:3:18,600-->00:3:20,600
How you doing?

44
00:3:20,600-->00:3:24,600
I know it hurts.

45
00:3:24,600-->00:3:27,600
But it'll be better tomorrow.

46
00:3:27,600-->00:3:29,600
In the meantime, what would you like?

47
00:3:29,600-->00:3:31,600
Surprise.

48
00:3:31,600-->00:3:33,600
A surprise?

49
00:3:33,600-->00:3:37,600
I promised you a surprise, didn't I?

50
00:3:37,600-->00:3:39,600
And it wasn't just ice cream, was it?

51
00:3:39,600-->00:3:43,600
Your birthday is tomorrow, isn't it?

52
00:3:43,600-->00:3:47,600
Well, maybe, just maybe,

53
00:3:47,600-->00:3:48,600
there will be a surprise.

54
00:3:48,600-->00:3:51,600
But first you have to smile.

55
00:3:51,600-->00:3:55,600
I just want to see one smile from you.

56
00:3:55,600-->00:4:0,600
No smile, no surprise.

57
00:4:0,600-->00:4:3,600
That's the deal.

58
00:4:3,600-->00:4:5,600
No smile, no surprise.

59
00:4:5,600-->00:4:7,600
If you want a surprise,

60
00:4:7,600-->00:4:9,600
then you've got to smile first.

61
00:4:9,600-->00:4:30,600
How you all doing ?

62
00:4:30,600-->00:4:32,600
Well, I'm glad you're feeling better

63
00:4:32,600-->00:4:35,600
because we have a little surprise for you today.

64
00:4:35,600-->00:4:37,600
It's Carl's birthday,

65
00:4:37,600-->00:4:40,600
and we have Popo the Clown to entertain you.

66
00:4:40,600-->00:4:42,600
And here he is--Popo the Clown.

67
00:4:42,600-->00:6:9,600

68
00:6:9,600-->00:6:12,600
Happy birthday, Carl.
Happy birthday.

69
00:6:12,600-->00:6:13,600
All right, everybody.

70
00:6:13,600-->00:6:14,600
OK, Carl.

71
00:6:14,600-->00:6:15,600
It's your birthday.

72
00:6:15,600-->00:6:17,600
What 's your wish?

73
00:6:17,600-->00:6:18,600
What would you like?

74
00:6:18,600-->00:6:19,600
Hmm?

75
00:6:19,600-->00:6:23,600
You want to play charades?
