Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:0:39,600-->00:0:42,600
Amtrak is happy to announce our arrival in New York City.

00:0:42,600-->00:0:45,600
The train will be stopping in five minutes.

4
00:0:45,600-->00:0:48,600
Please check to be sure you have your belongings.

5
00:0:48,600-->00:0:50,600
And have a good stay in the Big Apple.

6
00:0:50,600-->00:0:51,600
Thank you.

7
00:0:51,600-->00:0:53,600
Well, here we are.

8
00:0:53,600-->00:0:56,600
It was so nice meeting you, Mr. Stewart.

9
00:0:56,600-->00:0:59,600
And nice meeting you, too, Mrs. Tobin.

10
00:0:59,600-->00:1:00,600
Please look us up.

11
00:1:00,600-->00:1:02,600
We're in the phone book.

12
00:1:02,600-->00:1:05,600
Dr. Philip Stewart, in Riverdale. Philip Stewarrt

13
00:1:05,600-->00:1:06,600
Your son?

14
00:1:06,600-->00:1:10,600
That's right. And have a good time in New York.

15
00:1:10,600-->00:1:13,600
And don't be so independent.

16
00:1:13,600-->00:1:16,600
You're very lucky to have a caring family.

17
00:1:16,600-->00:1:30,600
When can we go fishing?

18
00:1:30,600-->00:1:33,600
Robbie, we'll go fishing soon, Robbie

19
00:1:33,600-->00:1:35,600
and we'll take your dad with us.

20
00:1:35,600-->00:1:39,600
I'm ready, Grandpa. You name the day.

21
00:1:39,600-->00:1:41,600
That's a great idea, Grandpa!

22
00:1:41,600-->00:1:43,600
Philip needs a day off. Philip

23
00:1:43,600-->00:1:46,600
Let's give him our presents--now.

24
00:1:46,600-->00:1:47,600
Good idea.

25
00:1:47,600-->00:1:49,600
Presents--for me?

26
00:1:49,600-->00:1:54,600
From me and Marilyn. Marilyn

27
00:1:54,600-->00:1:56,600
And this one's from me.

28
00:1:56,600-->00:1:59,600
I looked all over the house to find it.

29
00:1:59,600-->00:2:18,600
Richard, these are terrific pictures. Richard

30
00:2:18,600-->00:2:28,600
This one really brings back memories.

31
00:2:28,600-->00:2:32,600
You remember that day, Robbie?

32
00:2:32,600-->00:2:34,600
I sure do. It was fun.

33
00:2:34,600-->00:2:45,600
Oh, I'm sorry Susan isn't here.

34
00:2:45,600-->00:2:47,600
I miss her very much.

35
00:2:47,600-->00:2:50,600
She feels bad, too, Grandpa.

36
00:2:50,600-->00:2:53,600
She called to say the plane was delayed.

37
00:2:53,600-->00:2:54,600
You know airports.

38
00:2:54,600-->00:2:56,600
I can't wait to see her.

39
00:2:56,600-->00:3:00,600
She looks just like Grandma at that age.

40
00:3:00,600-->00:3:04,600
I'd better unpack.

41
00:3:04,600-->00:3:08,600
I started traveling twenty-four hours ago.

42
00:3:08,600-->00:3:13,600
I'm not so young anymore.

43
00:3:13,600-->00:3:17,600
Don't you want something to eat?

44
00:3:17,600-->00:3:19,600
No, thanks.

45
00:3:19,600-->00:3:22,600
After a good night's sleep, I'll enjoy breakfast even more.

46
00:3:22,600-->00:3:24,600
Well, come on, Dad.

47
00:3:24,600-->00:3:26,600
Ellen and I'll take you to your room. Ellen

48
00:3:26,600-->00:3:27,600
I'm sure glad you're here, Grandpa.

49
00:3:27,600-->00:3:29,600
Good night, Grandpa.

50
00:3:29,600-->00:3:30,600
Pleasant dreams.

51
00:3:30,600-->00:3:49,600
Philip, do you have the key to the trunk? Philip

52
00:3:49,600-->00:3:52,600
I have the key, but it doesn't work.

53
00:3:52,600-->00:4:01,600
I sent the wrong key.

54
00:4:01,600-->00:4:17,600
I have something for you. I made it myself.

55
00:4:17,600-->00:4:20,600
I think you'll enjoy it.

56
00:4:20,600-->00:4:25,600
I researched it for over a year.

57
00:4:25,600-->00:4:27,600
It's our family tree.

58
00:4:27,600-->00:4:35,600
Oh, Grandpa! How exciting!

59
00:4:35,600-->00:4:37,600
Fabulous!

60
00:4:37,600-->00:4:42,600
Why, I didn't know that your grandfather was born in Germany.

61
00:4:42,600-->00:4:45,600
Lots of interesting information about our family.

62
00:4:45,600-->00:4:47,600
A gift from me.

63
00:4:47,600-->00:4:50,600
Thank you so much.

64
00:4:50,600-->00:4:53,600
Grandpa! Grandpa!

65
00:4:53,600-->00:4:57,600
Oh, Grandpa, I'm so happy to see you!

66
00:4:57,600-->00:5:03,600
Oh, you look so beautiful, Susan. My granddaughter.

67
00:5:03,600-->00:5:08,600
Like I always said, you look just like Grandma.

68
00:5:08,600-->00:5:12,600
I think you're going to be very happy here with us.

69
00:5:12,600-->00:5:14,600
I know you will.

70
00:5:14,600-->00:5:30,600
I don't feel alone anymore.
