1
00:0:45,600-->00:0:49,600
Right this way, Mr. and Mrs. Stewart.

2
00:0:49,600-->00:0:59,600
Well, it's small, but clean.

3
00:0:59,600-->00:1:3,600
Clean? You call this clean?

4
00:1:3,600-->00:1:10,600
Have a nice stay.

5
00:1:10,600-->00:1:15,600
Thank you. I don't believe this.

6
00:1:15,600-->00:1:24,600
Well, it isn't the Watermill Inn,

7
00:1:24,600-->00:1:29,600
but let's get a look at the view.

8
00:1:29,600-->00:1:40,600
How is the view?

9
00:1:40,600-->00:1:42,600
Great,

10
00:1:42,600-->00:1:45,600
if you enjoy looking at a parking lot.

11
00:1:45,600-->00:1:50,600
Well, maybe we'll see the view in the morning.

12
00:1:50,600-->00:1:52,600
Right now, we should clean up this room.

13
00:1:52,600-->00:2:7,600

14
00:2:7,600-->00:2:10,600
Sorry, Marilyn.

15
00:2:10,600-->00:2:13,600
Why should you be sorry?

16
00:2:13,600-->00:2:18,600
Well, the rain, the room, the view of the parking lot.

17
00:2:18,600-->00:2:21,600
It isn't the way I hoped it would be.

18
00:2:21,600-->00:2:24,600
Stop blaming yourself.

19
00:2:24,600-->00:2:31,600
After all, we're here, we're alone, we're together.

20
00:2:31,600-->00:2:36,600
And I love you. Isn't that enough?

21
00:2:36,600-->00:2:38,600
It is for me,

22
00:2:38,600-->00:2:40,600
but I wanted this weekend to be special for you.

23
00:2:40,600-->00:2:47,600
It is special. Happy anniversary.

24
00:2:47,600-->00:2:55,600
It's still raining. I want to play tennis.

25
00:2:55,600-->00:2:58,600
I want some breakfast.

26
00:2:58,600-->00:3:1,600
Let's call room service and order a nice breakfast,

27
00:3:1,600-->00:3:3,600
and then we'll figure out what to do today.

28
00:3:3,600-->00:3:10,600
Right. Would you give me room service, please?

29
00:3:10,600-->00:3:18,600
I beg your pardon? Oh, I see.

30
00:3:18,600-->00:3:25,600
They don't have room service at Old Country Inn. Old Country Inn

31
00:3:25,600-->00:3:29,600
Well, let's go down to the coffee shop.

32
00:3:29,600-->00:3:32,600
They don't have a coffee shop.

33
00:3:32,600-->00:3:36,600
We can get our meals at Mrs. Montefiore's down the road.

34
00:3:36,600-->00:3:40,600
That's OK, honey.

35
00:3:40,600-->00:3:43,600
I love walking in the rain.

36
00:3:43,600-->00:3:46,600
Oh, you're being a really good sport about this, Marilyn,

37
00:3:46,600-->00:3:48,600
but I think we should face the truth.

38
00:3:48,600-->00:3:49,600
What's that?

39
00:3:49,600-->00:3:52,600
This is not the way to spend our fifth anniversary.

40
00:3:52,600-->00:3:55,600
Well, what do you want to do?

41
00:3:55,600-->00:3:58,600
Why don't we get in the car and drive home?

42
00:3:58,600-->00:4:1,600
Oh, Richard, it really isn't that bad.

43
00:4:1,600-->00:4:5,600
Do you want to stick it out for the whole weekend?

44
00:4:5,600-->00:4:10,600
Well, I'll admit the room is uncomfortable.

45
00:4:10,600-->00:4:11,600
Uh-hum.

46
00:4:11,600-->00:4:14,600
And I do feel bad about your mother

47
00:4:14,600-->00:4:16,600
having to take care of the baby all weekend.

48
00:4:16,600-->00:4:19,600
Why don't we just check out?

49
00:4:19,600-->00:4:20,600
OK.

50
00:4:20,600-->00:4:31,600
Hello? Yes. Yes, this is she.

51
00:4:31,600-->00:4:36,600
Oh, hello! How nice of you to remember us!

52
00:4:36,600-->00:4:38,600
Yes, my husband did call.

53
00:4:38,600-->00:4:45,600
You do? Really? It won't be any trouble?

54
00:4:45,600-->00:4:50,600
Oh, yes, I think we'd like that very much.

55
00:4:50,600-->00:4:57,600
Fifteen minutes! Thank you. Good-bye.

56
00:4:57,600-->00:5:3,600
You will never guess.

57
00:5:3,600-->00:5:6,600
Uh ... I give up.

58
00:5:6,600-->00:5:11,600
Mrs. Montefiore from the Watermill Inn.

59
00:5:11,600-->00:5:14,600
What is she calling about?

60
00:5:14,600-->00:5:16,600
They have an opening.

61
00:5:16,600-->00:5:18,600
Someone just checked out.

62
00:5:18,600-->00:5:22,600
and Mrs. Montefiore has reserved the honeymoon suite for us. Montefiore

63
00:5:22,600-->00:5:23,600
You're kidding!

64
00:5:23,600-->00:5:25,600
No. Isn't it wonderful?

65
00:5:25,600-->00:5:27,600
It's fantastic!

66
00:5:27,600-->00:5:30,600
Oh. Now all it has to do is stop raining.

67
00:5:30,600-->00:5:33,600
Let's go.
