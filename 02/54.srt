1
00:0:44,600-->00:0:47,600
My slogan is "I care".

2
00:0:47,600-->00:0:52,600
I care about people, not things.

3
00:0:52,600-->00:0:56,600
Vote for me, Ellen Stewart.

4
00:0:56,600-->00:0:58,600
I care.

5
00:0:58,600-->00:1:2,600
How was it?

6
00:1:2,600-->00:1:3,600
You were terrific!

7
00:1:3,600-->00:1:11,600
Can I see it?

8
00:1:11,600-->00:1:12,600
Sure.

9
00:1:12,600-->00:1:21,600
Hello. My name is Ellen Stewart,

10
00:1:21,600-->00:1:24,600
and I'm running for the open seat on the school board.

11
00:1:24,600-->00:1:28,600
My slogan is "I care".

12
00:1:28,600-->00:1:32,600
What does the word care mean?

13
00:1:32,600-->00:1:37,600
I care about people, not things.

14
00:1:37,600-->00:1:40,600
Vote for me, Ellen Stewart.

15
00:1:40,600-->00:1:42,600
I care.

16
00:1:42,600-->00:1:46,600
I like it,

17
00:1:46,600-->00:1:48,600
but now what?

18
00:1:48,600-->00:1:51,600
How can we possibly get it on so Riverdale

19
00:1:51,600-->00:1:53,600
will see it and hear it?

20
00:1:53,600-->00:1:56,600
Leave it to me.

21
00:1:56,600-->00:2:3,600
I mean that when I say "I care",

22
00:2:3,600-->00:2:6,600
I care about people, not things.

23
00:2:6,600-->00:2:12,600
Vote for me, Ellen Stewart.

24
00:2:12,600-->00:2:14,600
I care.

25
00:2:14,600-->00:2:16,600
What happened?

26
00:2:16,600-->00:2:19,600
Mom is now on television

27
00:2:19,600-->00:2:21,600
in every appliance store in Riverdale,

28
00:2:21,600-->00:2:22,600
except Hamlin's.

29
00:2:22,600-->00:2:24,600
He's a Boswell voter.

30
00:2:24,600-->00:2:26,600
That's a brilliant idea, Richard!

31
00:2:26,600-->00:2:28,600
You inherited your father's brains.

32
00:2:28,600-->00:2:31,600
We got our brains from you, Dad.

33
00:2:31,600-->00:2:32,600
And guess what?

34
00:2:32,600-->00:2:34,600
I called channel five.

35
00:2:34,600-->00:2:35,600
I called channel five.

36
00:2:35,600-->00:2:36,600
Their TV news is going to cover it.

37
00:2:36,600-->00:2:39,600
"Housewife campaigns in appliance stores."

38
00:2:39,600-->00:2:40,600
And I'll bet

39
00:2:40,600-->00:2:42,600
some magazine will pick up the story, too.

40
00:2:42,600-->00:2:45,600
Mom, you're going to win!

41
00:2:45,600-->00:2:46,600
I know it!

42
00:2:46,600-->00:2:47,600
Hold it, Robbie!

43
00:2:47,600-->00:2:48,600
Just cool down.

44
00:2:48,600-->00:2:50,600
I know we're getting some attention now,

45
00:2:50,600-->00:2:53,600
but in the end the voters will have to decide.

46
00:2:53,600-->00:2:57,600
You're gonna win.

47
00:2:57,600-->00:2:58,600
Trust me!

48
00:2:58,600-->00:3:2,600
In the hotly contested race

49
00:3:2,600-->00:3:5,600
for the one seat on the Riverdale School Board,

50
00:3:5,600-->00:3:8,600
Mrs. Ellen Stewart has taken an early lead.

51
00:3:8,600-->00:3:9,600
She's winning!

52
00:3:9,600-->00:3:10,600
Mom, you're winning!

53
00:3:10,600-->00:3:11,600
Now returning to other local news...

54
00:3:11,600-->00:3:12,600
Riverdale High School Riverdale

55
00:3:12,600-->00:3:13,600
beat its rival Horace Mann in baseball today It's too soon to know for certain.

56
00:3:13,600-->00:3:14,600
It's too soon to know for certain.

57
00:3:14,600-->00:3:15,600
You're ahead.

58
00:3:15,600-->00:3:16,600
That's better than being behind.

59
00:3:16,600-->00:3:17,600
More sports after this.

60
00:3:17,600-->00:3:18,600
It's not over yet.

61
00:3:18,600-->00:3:20,600
Let's just all calm down,

62
00:3:20,600-->00:3:22,600
and wait for the final results.

63
00:3:22,600-->00:3:26,600
Ellen, why don't you go out to the backyard

64
00:3:26,600-->00:3:27,600
and get some fresh air?

65
00:3:27,600-->00:3:29,600
Thank you, Grandpa.

66
00:3:29,600-->00:3:31,600
I need some.

67
00:3:31,600-->00:3:53,600
What happened?

68
00:3:53,600-->00:4:0,600
You came very close, Ellen.

69
00:4:0,600-->00:4:3,600
You lost by only a hundred and twenty-one votes.

70
00:4:3,600-->00:4:13,600
I lost.

71
00:4:13,600-->00:4:15,600
You tried, Mom.

72
00:4:15,600-->00:4:18,600
You lost by a very small number of votes.

73
00:4:18,600-->00:4:22,600
Only one hundred and twenty-one votes!

74
00:4:22,600-->00:4:24,600
I'm sorry, Mom.

75
00:4:24,600-->00:4:27,600
There just wasn't enough time.

76
00:4:27,600-->00:4:28,600
Look,

77
00:4:28,600-->00:4:30,600
you've made a very strong impression

78
00:4:30,600-->00:4:31,600
on our community.

79
00:4:31,600-->00:4:35,600
You'll have another chance next election.

80
00:4:35,600-->00:4:46,600
Hello.

81
00:4:46,600-->00:4:49,600
Oh, yes, yes, Mr. Maxwell.

82
00:4:49,600-->00:5:1,600
Hello, Mr. Maxwell.

83
00:5:1,600-->00:5:2,600
How are you?

84
00:5:2,600-->00:5:3,600
I just called to tell you

85
00:5:3,600-->00:5:5,600
that you are very impressive.

86
00:5:5,600-->00:5:7,600
You lost the election,

87
00:5:7,600-->00:5:9,600
but you won the attention of the residents of Riverdale,

88
00:5:9,600-->00:5:11,600
of Boswell, and of me.

89
00:5:11,600-->00:5:15,600
Well, thank you, Mr. Maxwell.

90
00:5:15,600-->00:5:17,600
I appreciate your kind words.

91
00:5:17,600-->00:5:19,600
I needed that.

92
00:5:19,600-->00:5:21,600
I hear Boswell

93
00:5:21,600-->00:5:23,600
wants to appoint you to a special arts committee.

94
00:5:23,600-->00:5:24,600
I'm sending over a reporter

95
00:5:24,600-->00:5:26,600
in the morning to interview you.

96
00:5:26,600-->00:5:28,600
You are?

97
00:5:28,600-->00:5:31,600
I'm gonna do an article

98
00:5:31,600-->00:5:33,600
on "Ellen Stewart, she cares".

99
00:5:33,600-->00:5:36,600
Maybe we'll all care now.

100
00:5:36,600-->00:5:37,600
Good-bye.

101
00:5:37,600-->00:5:41,600
Thank you,

102
00:5:41,600-->00:5:43,600
and good-bye.

103
00:5:43,600-->00:5:52,600
What was that about?

104
00:5:52,600-->00:5:54,600
You were right, Philip.

105
00:5:54,600-->00:5:57,600
I did make a difference in town.

106
00:5:57,600-->00:5:59,600
And in this family.
