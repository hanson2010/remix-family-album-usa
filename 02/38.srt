1
00:1:13,600-->00:1:15,600
It's almost ten o'clock.

2
00:1:15,600-->00:1:19,600
I've got to go. Tomorrow is Monday,

3
00:1:19,600-->00:1:21,600
and work begins at eight in the morning for me.

4
00:1:21,600-->00:1:23,600
Oh, I'm so happy that Max is home.

5
00:1:23,600-->00:1:25,600
He's the sweetest little thing.

6
00:1:25,600-->00:1:28,600
I'll drive you to the station, dear.

7
00:1:28,600-->00:1:32,600
You can catch the ten-twenty train to Grand Central Station.

8
00:1:32,600-->00:1:34,600
I'll drive Susan, dear.

9
00:1:34,600-->00:1:36,600
Thank you, Philip.

10
00:1:36,600-->00:1:37,600
Then Grandpa, Robbie,

11
00:1:37,600-->00:1:40,600
and I can finish wrapping all these gifts.

12
00:1:40,600-->00:1:57,600

13
00:1:57,600-->00:2:0,600
It's so good to have you home again...

14
00:2:0,600-->00:2:7,600
and to see Max asleep in his bassinet at home with us.

15
00:2:7,600-->00:2:13,600
To be with our family and all that Stewart TLC.

16
00:2:13,600-->00:2:20,600
TLC - tender loving care.

17
00:2:20,600-->00:2:23,600
That's our motto.

18
00:2:23,600-->00:2:27,600
Did you see the washcloth

19
00:2:27,600-->00:2:30,600
and the towels with the teddy bears on them?

20
00:2:30,600-->00:2:33,600
Alexandra and the Molinas sent them for Max.

21
00:2:33,600-->00:2:36,600
It was so kind of them.

22
00:2:36,600-->00:2:39,600
Now Max has come into everyone's life.

23
00:2:39,600-->00:2:41,600
The house is so alive with him here.

24
00:2:41,600-->00:2:46,600
The welcome sign over the door.

25
00:2:46,600-->00:2:49,600
The boxes of presents.

26
00:2:49,600-->00:2:51,600
The M-A-X over his bassinet.

27
00:2:51,600-->00:2:54,600
Robbie put that there.

28
00:2:54,600-->00:2:56,600
Susan's teddy bear.

29
00:2:56,600-->00:3:2,600
So cuddly. The beautiful crib from Mom and Dad.

30
00:3:2,600-->00:3:6,600
Oh, and Grandpa's baseball glove.

31
00:3:6,600-->00:3:10,600
You know, it hung over my crib, too.

32
00:3:10,600-->00:3:13,600
And it hung over Robbie's crib.

33
00:3:13,600-->00:3:15,600
Part of Grandpa's magic?

34
00:3:15,600-->00:3:17,600
Oh, that's not all.

35
00:3:17,600-->00:3:19,600
It hung over Susan's crib.

36
00:3:19,600-->00:3:20,600
The same baseball glove?

37
00:3:20,600-->00:3:25,600
That's right. Grandpa hangs it there for good luck.

38
00:3:25,600-->00:3:28,600
He says it always brought him good luck on the baseball team.

39
00:3:28,600-->00:3:33,600
He believes it'll bring good luck to all the Stewart babies.

40
00:3:33,600-->00:3:35,600
And then he takes it back

41
00:3:35,600-->00:3:37,600
when Max is ready to use it?

42
00:3:37,600-->00:3:38,600
Yes,

43
00:3:38,600-->00:3:40,600
and replaces it with a new glove

44
00:3:40,600-->00:3:42,600
so the old one will be ready

45
00:3:42,600-->00:3:44,600
for a new member of the Stewart family.

46
00:3:44,600-->00:3:47,600
Grandpa really loves his family, doesn't he?

47
00:3:47,600-->00:3:51,600
So do I.

48
00:3:51,600-->00:3:54,600
And so do I.

49
00:3:54,600-->00:4:2,600
And so does Max.

50
00:4:2,600-->00:4:5,600
After he eats!
