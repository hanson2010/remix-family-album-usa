00:1:53,600-->00:1:56,600
What's this for?

2
00:1:56,600-->00:1:58,600
Just because. How's the baby?

3
00:1:58,600-->00:2:0,600
Fast asleep.

4
00:2:0,600-->00:2:2,600
I'm sorry I missed him.

5
00:2:2,600-->00:2:3,600
I had to work late.

6
00:2:3,600-->00:2:6,600
What are the flowers for, Richard?

7
00:2:6,600-->00:2:10,600
Five years of happiness. Happy anniversary.

8
00:2:10,600-->00:2:13,600
But our anniversary isn't until Saturday.

9
00:2:13,600-->00:2:14,600
I couldn't wait.

10
00:2:14,600-->00:2:18,600
Besides, we are not going to be here Saturday.

11
00:2:18,600-->00:2:19,600
We're not?

12
00:2:19,600-->00:2:20,600
Uh-uh.

13
00:2:20,600-->00:2:22,600
Where are we going to be?

14
00:2:22,600-->00:2:28,600
If you had your choice of all the places in the world.

15
00:2:28,600-->00:2:30,600
where would you choose to spend our anniversary?

16
00:2:30,600-->00:2:34,600
The Watermill Inn. Watermill Inn

17
00:2:34,600-->00:2:37,600
I loved that place when we went on our honeymoon.

18
00:2:37,600-->00:2:40,600
Perfect! You picked the right place.

19
00:2:40,600-->00:2:43,600
I don't understand.

20
00:2:43,600-->00:2:45,600
You and I, Mrs. Stewart, Stewart

21
00:2:45,600-->00:2:47,600
are going to spend a second honeymoon at the Watermill Inn.

22
00:2:47,600-->00:2:52,600
Oh, Richard! That's wonderful, but--

23
00:2:52,600-->00:2:53,600
No buts.

24
00:2:53,600-->00:2:54,600
What about the baby?

25
00:2:54,600-->00:2:56,600
Aren't we taking the baby on our honeymoon?

26
00:2:56,600-->00:2:57,600
Absolutely not.

27
00:2:57,600-->00:2:59,600
The world's greatest grandmother, Mrs. Ellen Stewart,

28
00:2:59,600-->00:3:1,600
has agreed to take care of him for the weekend.

29
00:3:1,600-->00:3:6,600
Richard, isn't that too much to ask of your mother? Richard

30
00:3:6,600-->00:3:9,600
Too much? She loves taking care of Max.

31
00:3:9,600-->00:3:14,600
But ... I'll miss him.

32
00:3:14,600-->00:3:17,600
Well, we'll phone every hour,

33
00:3:17,600-->00:3:19,600
and you can listen to him over the phone.

34
00:3:19,600-->00:3:21,600
Come on, Mar.

35
00:3:21,600-->00:3:24,600
It's time you and I had a romantic weekend alone together.

36
00:3:24,600-->00:3:29,600
We've earned it. What do you say?

37
00:3:29,600-->00:3:33,600
It does sound tempting.

38
00:3:33,600-->00:3:37,600
You're right. We've earned it.

39
00:3:37,600-->00:3:41,600
Great! I'll make a reservation right now.

40
00:3:41,600-->00:3:44,600
Remember that wonderful little balcony

41
00:3:44,600-->00:3:45,600
where we had our meals ...

42
00:3:45,600-->00:3:47,600
with a view of the Hudson River?

43
00:3:47,600-->00:3:49,600
How could I forget?

44
00:3:49,600-->00:3:58,600

45
00:3:58,600-->00:4:1,600
Hello. Is Mrs. Montefiore there?

46
00:4:1,600-->00:4:5,600
Ah. She's out.

47
00:4:5,600-->00:4:7,600
Yes. This is Richard Stewart.

48
00:4:7,600-->00:4:9,600
My wife and I spent our honeymoon at the inn.

49
00:4:9,600-->00:4:13,600
No, we didn't leave anything in the room.

50
00:4:13,600-->00:4:14,600
It's five years ago.

51
00:4:14,600-->00:4:16,600
We'd like to make a reservation for this weekend.

52
00:4:16,600-->00:4:20,600
Yes, a double room, please.

53
00:4:20,600-->00:4:22,600
What?

54
00:4:22,600-->00:4:29,600
Are you sure? But ... OK.

55
00:4:29,600-->00:4:32,600
Nothing available.

56
00:4:32,600-->00:4:34,600
Wait! Don't hang up!

57
00:4:34,600-->00:4:37,600
Can you recommend someplace nice--someplace nearby?

58
00:4:37,600-->00:4:47,600
Uh--hold it. Old Country Inn?

59
00:4:47,600-->00:4:52,600
Right. And the phone number?

60
00:4:52,600-->00:4:59,600
555-2420. Thank you. 555 2420

61
00:4:59,600-->00:5:2,600
He says there's another inn

62
00:5:2,600-->00:5:4,600
just half a mile down the road from the Watermill.

63
00:5:4,600-->00:5:8,600
It won't be the same, but what do you say?

64
00:5:8,600-->00:5:10,600
Well ...

65
00:5:10,600-->00:5:12,600
My mom is available to baby-sit this weekend.

66
00:5:12,600-->00:5:15,600
Well, OK. See if they have a room.

67
00:5:15,600-->00:5:16,600
Right!

68
00:5:16,600-->00:5:26,600
Hello. Is this the Old Country Inn?

69
00:5:26,600-->00:5:29,600
Yes. This is Richard Stewart.

70
00:5:29,600-->00:5:32,600
The desk clerk at the Watemill suggested your inn. Watemill Inn

71
00:5:32,600-->00:5:34,600
Would you happen to have a room for two availbale

72
00:5:34,600-->00:5:35,600
this weekend?

73
00:5:35,600-->00:5:37,600
Something really nice.

74
00:5:37,600-->00:5:40,600
My wife and I are celebrating our fifth anniversary.

75
00:5:40,600-->00:5:47,600
Yes. I'll hold. He's checking. You do?

76
00:5:47,600-->00:5:50,600
Great! What is the daily rate?

77
00:5:50,600-->00:5:53,600
That's fine. Thank you.

78
00:5:53,600-->00:5:57,600
Yes, we'll be arriving by car about ten o'clock Friday night.

79
00:5:57,600-->00:6:4,600
Stewart. S-t-e-w-a-r-t. Thank you. Stewart S t e w a r t

80
00:6:4,600-->00:6:10,600
Done! You and I, Mrs. Stewart.
