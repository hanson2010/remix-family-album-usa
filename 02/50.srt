00:0:40,600-->00:0:42,600
Good morning.

2
00:0:42,600-->00:0:44,600
Good morning. My name is Richard Stewart.

3
00:0:44,600-->00:0:46,600
I'm here to see Mr. Carlson.

4
00:0:46,600-->00:0:48,600
Please sit down, Mr. Stewart.

5
00:0:48,600-->00:0:50,600
Mr. Carlson will be with you shortly. Carlson

6
00:0:50,600-->00:0:51,600
Thank you.

7
00:0:51,600-->00:0:56,600
Excuse me, Mr. Carlson,

8
00:0:56,600-->00:0:57,600
but Richard Stewart is here

9
00:0:57,600-->00:0:59,600
for his ten o'clock appointment with you.

10
00:0:59,600-->00:1:1,600
OK. Thank you.

11
00:1:1,600-->00:1:3,600
Like I said, he'll be with you shortly.

12
00:1:3,600-->00:1:5,600
Thank you.

13
00:1:5,600-->00:1:13,600
Yes, Mr. Carlson. Yes, sir.

14
00:1:13,600-->00:1:16,600
He's ready for you, Mr. Stewart.

15
00:1:16,600-->00:1:19,600
Thank you. In there?

16
00:1:19,600-->00:1:23,600
Yes. In there. Good luck.

17
00:1:23,600-->00:1:27,600
Come in, come in.

18
00:1:27,600-->00:1:33,600
This is a crazy morning. Hello, Richard.

19
00:1:33,600-->00:1:34,600
Hello, Mr. Carlson.

20
00:1:34,600-->00:1:35,600
Sit down, sit down.

21
00:1:35,600-->00:1:39,600
Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.

22
00:1:39,600-->00:1:41,600
I hope you've brought your pictures along.

23
00:1:41,600-->00:1:43,600
I see that you have. Let's get right to it.

24
00:1:43,600-->00:1:49,600
We need a new coffee-table book,

25
00:1:49,600-->00:1:53,600
and a book of photos about the United States still feels right.

26
00:1:53,600-->00:1:55,600
OK, let's take a look.

27
00:1:55,600-->00:2:16,600
Good. Very good. Family Album, U.S.A.

28
00:2:16,600-->00:2:18,600
It's an excellent title.

29
00:2:18,600-->00:2:21,600
If you had to describe the book in one sentence,

30
00:2:21,600-->00:2:23,600
how would you do it?

31
00:2:23,600-->00:2:28,600
Well, I'd describe it as a book which is a ...

32
00:2:28,600-->00:2:31,600
a portrait of the United States--

33
00:2:31,600-->00:2:35,600
the places, the people--mostly the people.

34
00:2:35,600-->00:2:39,600
The things they do, the ways they live,

35
00:2:39,600-->00:2:41,600
the places they visit, and the landmarks.

36
00:2:41,600-->00:2:44,600
A photographic journey.

37
00:2:44,600-->00:2:46,600
These are wonderful--

38
00:2:46,600-->00:2:49,600
these photos in your performing arts section.

39
00:2:49,600-->00:2:52,600
Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center.

40
00:2:52,600-->00:2:53,600
I'm glad you like them.

41
00:2:53,600-->00:2:56,600
I do, but ...

42
00:2:56,600-->00:2:58,600
But?

43
00:2:58,600-->00:3:3,600
There's something missing. You've got a good eye, Richard.

44
00:3:3,600-->00:3:5,600
You're a terrific photographer.

45
00:3:5,600-->00:3:8,600
But before I can publish your work,

46
00:3:8,600-->00:3:11,600
I need to meet with my marketing department,

47
00:3:11,600-->00:3:13,600
and you've got to do one more thing.

48
00:3:13,600-->00:3:16,600
What's that, Mr. Carlson?

49
00:3:16,600-->00:3:18,600
In the section on culture,

50
00:3:18,600-->00:3:20,600
you've included performing arts centers,

51
00:3:20,600-->00:3:22,600
but you've left out street performance.

52
00:3:22,600-->00:3:30,600
The mimes.

53
00:3:30,600-->00:3:32,600
Richard, if you go out Richard

54
00:3:32,600-->00:3:34,600
and photograph street performances in the city,

55
00:3:34,600-->00:3:36,600
you'll have it.

56
00:3:36,600-->00:3:39,600
That is a great idea.

57
00:3:39,600-->00:3:42,600
The performing arts centers and the street performances.

58
00:3:42,600-->00:3:44,600
I'll do it.

59
00:3:44,600-->00:3:47,600
If you do it, I'll publish your work.

60
00:3:47,600-->00:3:49,600
Are you serious?

61
00:3:49,600-->00:3:51,600
I've never been more serious.

62
00:3:51,600-->00:3:54,600
When do you think you can return with street performances?

63
00:3:54,600-->00:3:57,600
A couple of weeks.

64
00:3:57,600-->00:4:1,600
If they're as good as the rest of these pictures, it's a deal.

65
00:4:1,600-->00:4:5,600
You won't be disappointed, Mr. Carlson. Thanks.

66
00:4:5,600-->00:4:11,600
Good-bye, Richard, and good luck. See you in two weeks.

67
00:4:11,600-->00:4:13,600
Good-bye, Mr. Carlson. Thanks.

68
00:4:13,600-->00:4:21,600
So if you like the street-performance photos,

69
00:4:21,600-->00:4:24,600
you'll really publish Family Album, U.S.A.?

70
00:4:24,600-->00:4:27,600
When I say something, I mean it.

71
00:4:27,600-->00:4:30,600
Go to work. Good-bye.

72
00:4:30,600-->00:4:32,600
Good-bye.
