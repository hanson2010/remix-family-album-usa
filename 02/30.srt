00:1:36,600-->00:1:39,000
Oh, it's a quarter to four,

2
00:1:39,000-->00:1:41,600
and I have a production meeting at four.

3
00:1:41,600-->00:1:44,600
I planned to take you for a ride in Central Park

4
00:1:44,600-->00:1:45,600
in a horse and carriage.

5
00:1:45,600-->00:1:47,600
Harry, I'd love to, Harry

6
00:1:47,600-->00:1:48,600
but I have work to do.

7
00:1:48,600-->00:1:52,600
OK. We'll walk back to your office with you.

8
00:1:52,600-->00:1:55,600
It's so nice out.

9
00:1:55,600-->00:1:58,600
I decided to forget about my accounting problems

10
00:1:58,600-->00:2:1,600
and just enjoy this beautiful spring day.

11
00:2:1,600-->00:2:2,600
Take the time, Susan.

12
00:2:2,600-->00:2:5,600
I know I should,

13
00:2:5,600-->00:2:8,600
but ... well, there are too many things to do.

14
00:2:8,600-->00:2:10,600
I understand.

15
00:2:10,600-->00:2:12,600
I'll go for a ride with Michelle.

16
00:2:12,600-->00:2:14,600
Right.

17
00:2:14,600-->00:2:18,600
Well, I had a really nice time.

18
00:2:18,600-->00:2:19,600
So did I.

19
00:2:19,600-->00:2:21,600
So did I.

20
00:2:21,600-->00:2:23,600
I'm sorry you can't come with us, Susan.

21
00:2:23,600-->00:2:24,600
So am I.

22
00:2:24,600-->00:2:27,600
Bye-bye.

23
00:2:27,600-->00:2:31,600
Harry! Michelle!

24
00:2:31,600-->00:2:36,600
Can you wait till I make a phone call?

25
00:2:36,600-->00:2:37,600
Sure.

26
00:2:37,600-->00:2:51,600

27
00:2:51,600-->00:2:53,600
Susan Stewart's office. Susan Stewart

28
00:2:53,600-->00:2:55,600
Sam, this is Susan. Sam

29
00:2:55,600-->00:2:56,600
Hi. How was lunch?

30
00:2:56,600-->00:2:57,600
Fine.

31
00:2:57,600-->00:2:59,600
You're late.

32
00:2:59,600-->00:3:2,600
The production department's waiting in the conference room.

33
00:3:2,600-->00:3:3,600
I know.

34
00:3:3,600-->00:3:4,600
Ask Paul Smith to fill in for me.

35
00:3:4,600-->00:3:6,600
He knows everything about the production schedule,

36
00:3:6,600-->00:3:8,600
and he can answer any questions.

37
00:3:8,600-->00:3:9,600
Right.

38
00:3:9,600-->00:3:11,600
Don't tell any one,

39
00:3:11,600-->00:3:13,600
but I'm taking a little time to smell the flowers.

40
00:3:13,600-->00:3:15,600
Good for you.

41
00:3:15,600-->00:3:16,600
It'll be our secret.

42
00:3:16,600-->00:3:18,600
But schedule another production meeting for tomorrow.

43
00:3:18,600-->00:3:19,600
I'll be back

44
00:3:19,600-->00:3:21,600
for my six o'clock appointment with Mr. Ozawa.

45
00:3:21,600-->00:3:22,600
OK, Susan.

46
00:3:22,600-->00:3:23,600
And have a nice afternoon.

47
00:3:23,600-->00:3:24,600
Thanks.

48
00:3:24,600-->00:4:4,600

49
00:4:4,600-->00:4:6,600
She likes you.

50
00:4:6,600-->00:4:8,600
I know. I like her.

51
00:4:8,600-->00:4:9,600
How'd you do it?

52
00:4:9,600-->00:4:11,600
We had a talk.

53
00:4:11,600-->00:4:12,600
About what?

54
00:4:12,600-->00:4:13,600
Life.

55
00:4:13,600-->00:4:15,600
And what did you decide?

56
00:4:15,600-->00:4:19,600
That's a secret ... between us women.
