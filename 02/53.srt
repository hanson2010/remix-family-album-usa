1
00:0:44,600-->00:0:46,600
Here are the fliers, hot off the press!

2
00:0:46,600-->00:0:52,600
Looks good.

3
00:0:52,600-->00:0:54,600
Simple.

4
00:0:54,600-->00:0:56,600
Right over here, Grandpa.

5
00:0:56,600-->00:0:58,600
You fold the fliers.

6
00:0:58,600-->00:1:0,600
Richard and I will put them into the envelopes.

7
00:1:0,600-->00:1:2,600
We finished addressing over three hundred envelopes.

8
00:1:2,600-->00:1:4,600
Need another box?

9
00:1:4,600-->00:1:6,600
Good work, gang.

10
00:1:6,600-->00:1:7,600
Hi, this is Mike Johnson.

11
00:1:7,600-->00:1:8,600
Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs. Anderson?

12
00:1:8,600-->00:1:9,600
Mr. Nelson. Nelson

13
00:1:9,600-->00:1:11,600
Hi. This is Robbie Stewart.

14
00:1:11,600-->00:1:12,600
Did you know

15
00:1:12,600-->00:1:14,600
my mother is running for the school board?

16
00:1:14,600-->00:1:16,600
Yes, Miss Kim, Ellen Stewart.

17
00:1:16,600-->00:1:17,600
"She cares."

18
00:1:17,600-->00:1:19,600
Oh, see you at the polls.

19
00:1:19,600-->00:1:20,600
Certainly.

20
00:1:20,600-->00:1:21,600
I'll give her your best wishes,

21
00:1:21,600-->00:1:22,600
Mr. Nelson. Nelson

22
00:1:22,600-->00:1:23,600
Hi, this is Mike Johnson.

23
00:1:23,600-->00:1:25,600
Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs. Burns?

24
00:1:25,600-->00:1:26,600
Thank you.

25
00:1:26,600-->00:1:27,600
We have done so much

26
00:1:27,600-->00:1:28,600
in such a short amount of time.

27
00:1:28,600-->00:1:29,600
I can't believe it!

28
00:1:29,600-->00:1:32,600
Wait till Philip comes home and sees our progress.

29
00:1:32,600-->00:1:35,600
Everyone saw the story in the Riverdale newspaper.

30
00:1:35,600-->00:1:37,600
Mr. Maxwell was very kind Maxwell

31
00:1:37,600-->00:1:38,600
to print my announcement.

32
00:1:38,600-->00:1:40,600
It helps enormously.

33
00:1:40,600-->00:1:43,600
Everybody in Riverdale reads his paper. Riverdale

34
00:1:43,600-->00:1:46,600
Your photo in it helped, too.

35
00:1:46,600-->00:1:47,600
Thanks to you, Richard,

36
00:1:47,600-->00:1:48,600
it's a good picture.

37
00:1:48,600-->00:1:51,600
Well, hi, all.

38
00:1:51,600-->00:1:52,600
Hi, Dad.

39
00:1:52,600-->00:1:53,600
Hello, darling.

40
00:1:53,600-->00:1:54,600
May I ... may I help?

41
00:1:54,600-->00:1:56,600
Licking envelopes.

42
00:1:56,600-->00:1:58,600
I fold the fliers.

43
00:1:58,600-->00:1:59,600
We stuff them.

44
00:1:59,600-->00:2:2,600
And I lick the envelopes.

45
00:2:2,600-->00:2:5,600
Hey, everybody,

46
00:2:5,600-->00:2:8,600
Mrs. Greenberg is on the phone. Greenberg

47
00:2:8,600-->00:2:10,600
She says Carter Boswell is on the TV right now--

48
00:2:10,600-->00:2:11,600
doing a commercial.

49
00:2:11,600-->00:2:12,600
What channel?

50
00:2:12,600-->00:2:16,600
Five. 5

51
00:2:16,600-->00:2:22,600
... and if you ask what I care about, I'll tell you.

52
00:2:22,600-->00:2:27,600
I care about the school buildings in need of paint.

53
00:2:27,600-->00:2:29,600
I care about more lockers for the teachers.

54
00:2:29,600-->00:2:33,600
I care about new fixtures in the hallways--

55
00:2:33,600-->00:2:36,600
not music or dancing or entertainment.

56
00:2:36,600-->00:2:40,600
I care about the practical things.

57
00:2:40,600-->00:2:45,600
If you do, vote for me, Carter Boswell.

58
00:2:45,600-->00:2:50,600
A lot of people will agree with him.

59
00:2:50,600-->00:2:54,600
I told you.

60
00:2:54,600-->00:2:57,600
Too bad kids can't vote.

61
00:2:57,600-->00:2:59,600
It's our school, but we can't vote.

62
00:2:59,600-->00:3:3,600
There are people in favor of the cultural programs, Mom.

63
00:3:3,600-->00:3:4,600
There are, Ellen.

64
00:3:4,600-->00:3:7,600
Don't be upset by Boswell's commercial.

65
00:3:7,600-->00:3:10,600
You have to go on television, too.

66
00:3:10,600-->00:3:13,600
Boswell's a powerful speaker. Boswell

67
00:3:13,600-->00:3:17,600
You can be, too.

68
00:3:17,600-->00:3:19,600
Your ideas are good ones.

69
00:3:19,600-->00:3:22,600
I don't know.

70
00:3:22,600-->00:3:28,600
I'm not sure I'm up to it.
