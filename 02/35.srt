00:0:53,600-->00:0:56,600
Sam, would you come in, please? Sam

2
00:0:56,600-->00:1:1,600
You sound like something's bothering you, Susan.

3
00:1:1,600-->00:1:4,600
The sketches for the cover of the new doll book?

4
00:1:4,600-->00:1:6,600
That's not it.

5
00:1:6,600-->00:1:7,600
Please sit down.

6
00:1:7,600-->00:1:8,600
Sure.

7
00:1:8,600-->00:1:16,600
I need your advice on a personsal matter,

8
00:1:16,600-->00:1:17,600
but it's not about me.

9
00:1:17,600-->00:1:20,600
You need my advice on a personal matter,

10
00:1:20,600-->00:1:22,600
and it's not about you.

11
00:1:22,600-->00:1:25,600
It's about my grandfather.

12
00:1:25,600-->00:1:27,600
What's the problem?

13
00:1:27,600-->00:1:30,600
It won't sound like a big deal,

14
00:1:30,600-->00:1:31,600
but it is.

15
00:1:31,600-->00:1:33,600
I had dinner with him Saturday,

16
00:1:33,600-->00:1:35,600
and he's very unhappy about not working.

17
00:1:35,600-->00:1:38,600
I thought he was retired

18
00:1:38,600-->00:1:39,600
and pleased to be living with the family.

19
00:1:39,600-->00:1:41,600
He is,

20
00:1:41,600-->00:1:44,600
but there's so much energy and talent in the man,

21
00:1:44,600-->00:1:45,600
and he doesn't get to use it.

22
00:1:45,600-->00:1:46,600
But what can I do?

23
00:1:46,600-->00:1:48,600
What kind of advice are you looking for?

24
00:1:48,600-->00:1:50,600
Simply this.

25
00:1:50,600-->00:1:53,600
John Marchetta runs this company. John Marchetta

26
00:1:53,600-->00:1:54,600
He founded this company.

27
00:1:54,600-->00:1:55,600
Right.

28
00:1:55,600-->00:1:59,600
John Marchetta gave me my start here six years ago,

29
00:1:59,600-->00:2:2,600
When I first graduated from college.

30
00:2:2,600-->00:2:5,600
He gave me the chance to use my talents

31
00:2:5,600-->00:2:7,600
and made me feel more confident.

32
00:2:7,600-->00:2:10,600
Right.

33
00:2:10,600-->00:2:12,600
Maybe he can do the same thing for your grandfather.

34
00:2:12,600-->00:2:16,600
Or at least give him some advice.

35
00:2:16,600-->00:2:17,600
Right.

36
00:2:17,600-->00:2:19,600
Then I've solved your problem.

37
00:2:19,600-->00:2:23,600
I can always depend on you, Sam.

38
00:2:23,600-->00:2:25,600
I'm glad to help.

39
00:2:25,600-->00:2:28,600
Shall I call Mr. Marchetta for you?

40
00:2:28,600-->00:2:31,600
No, no. I'll do that.

41
00:2:31,600-->00:2:33,600
Thanks.

42
00:2:33,600-->00:2:40,600
Now, how's the Stewart family?

43
00:2:40,600-->00:2:42,600
Fine, thank you, Mr. Mrarchetta.

44
00:2:42,600-->00:2:45,600
Except for my grandfather.

45
00:2:45,600-->00:2:47,600
What's wrong, Susan?

46
00:2:47,600-->00:2:49,600
What's wrong with him?

47
00:2:49,600-->00:2:51,600
He needs to work.

48
00:2:51,600-->00:2:57,600
In fact, that is the reason why I'm here to see you.

49
00:2:57,600-->00:3:1,600
I know you're building a new factory,

50
00:3:1,600-->00:3:4,600
and I thought ... maybe ...

51
00:3:4,600-->00:3:7,600
my grandfather is

52
00:3:7,600-->00:3:9,600
so experienced in the construction trade,

53
00:3:9,600-->00:3:12,600
he could be so valuable.

54
00:3:12,600-->00:3:15,600
Tell him to come and see me

55
00:3:15,600-->00:3:18,600
at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

56
00:3:18,600-->00:3:20,600
I have an idea that may solve the problem for him

57
00:3:20,600-->00:3:22,600
and help a lot of other people.

58
00:3:22,600-->00:3:23,600
Really, Mr. Marchetta?

59
00:3:23,600-->00:3:25,600
Can I tell him that?

60
00:3:25,600-->00:3:26,600
Sure can.

61
00:3:26,600-->00:3:27,600
Ten o'clock in the morning. Here.

62
00:3:27,600-->00:3:31,600
Oh, thank you!
