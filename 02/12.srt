1
00:0:37,600-->00:0:41,600
Grandpa, Ellen, Philip, Robbie, you and me.

2
00:0:41,600-->00:0:43,600
That's six steaks.

3
00:0:43,600-->00:0:47,600
Don't forget Susan.

4
00:0:47,600-->00:0:50,600
Seven steaks.

5
00:0:50,600-->00:0:55,600
Cooking dinner for the entire family is not so easy.

6
00:0:55,600-->00:0:59,600
The shopping: the salad:

7
00:0:59,600-->00:1:4,600
tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, and onions.

8
00:1:4,600-->00:1:10,600
The main course: steak and potatoes.

9
00:1:10,600-->00:1:14,600
Richard, how much broccoli do I need for seven people? Richard

10
00:1:14,600-->00:1:19,600
Marilyn, I have to tell you something. Marilyn

11
00:1:19,600-->00:1:22,600
At today's exercise class...

12
00:1:22,600-->00:1:24,600
Yes, Richard.

13
00:1:24,600-->00:1:30,600
Well, I didn't really exercise.

14
00:1:30,600-->00:1:32,600
I knew it!

15
00:1:32,600-->00:1:36,600
I wanted to, but Jack Davis needed a photographer.

16
00:1:36,600-->00:1:38,600
I'm sorry, Marilyn.

17
00:1:38,600-->00:1:41,600
I don't understand. Did you exercise or not?

18
00:1:41,600-->00:1:44,600
No. Instead of exercising, I photographed the class.

19
00:1:44,600-->00:1:45,600
And you didn't exercise?

20
00:1:45,600-->00:1:47,600
No.

21
00:1:47,600-->00:1:55,600
There's another advanced class today at four o'clock.

22
00:1:55,600-->00:1:57,600
We'll go together.

23
00:1:57,600-->00:1:59,600
What about the bet?

24
00:1:59,600-->00:2:5,600
Oh, the bet is still on, but you shop for the groceries.

25
00:2:5,600-->00:2:12,600
Remember, you win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

26
00:2:12,600-->00:2:16,600
You win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

27
00:2:16,600-->00:2:18,600
Including Susan.

28
00:2:18,600-->00:2:24,600
Four o'clock at the advanced exercise class. With me.

29
00:2:24,600-->00:2:36,600
Don't forget to breathe.

30
00:2:36,600-->00:2:37,600
Skip, hop, front.

31
00:2:37,600-->00:2:52,600
Twist... again.... OK, now... scissors.

32
00:2:52,600-->00:3:0,600
This is fun. It's a piece of cake.

33
00:3:0,600-->00:3:4,600
Yeah. Just wait.

34
00:3:4,600-->00:3:11,600
5, 6, 7, go right, 1, 2, back, 5 6 7

35
00:3:11,600-->00:3:15,600
2, 3 , 1, 2, 3, pony, pony... 2 3 1 2 33

36
00:3:15,600-->00:3:21,600
1, 2, 3, kick... 1, 2, 3, kick... pony. 1 2 3

37
00:3:21,600-->00:3:27,600
And twist, twist.

38
00:3:27,600-->00:3:29,600
OK. Let's pick up the pace.

39
00:3:29,600-->00:3:30,600
How are you doing, Richard?

40
00:3:30,600-->00:3:31,600
I can barely move.

41
00:3:31,600-->00:3:45,600
2, 3, 4, front. Now we're going to run it off. 2 3 4

42
00:3:45,600-->00:3:47,600
Front... knees up, knees up.

43
00:3:47,600-->00:3:49,600
OK. Finish off by jogging in place.

44
00:3:49,600-->00:3:53,600
OK. Keep those knees up.

45
00:3:53,600-->00:3:54,600
All right. That's it for today.

46
00:3:54,600-->00:3:57,600
Thank you, everyone. See you next week.

47
00:3:57,600-->00:4:0,600
Thank you, Jack, but no thank you.

48
00:4:0,600-->00:4:5,600
The advanced exercise class is not so easy, huh?

49
00:4:5,600-->00:4:11,600
No, no, you were right. I was wrong.

50
00:4:11,600-->00:4:17,600
Come on, Richard. Get up. Let's go.

51
00:4:17,600-->00:4:20,600
You have to cook dinner for the entire family.

52
00:4:20,600-->00:4:25,600
Marilyn, I'm exhausted. I can't move. Marilyn

53
00:4:25,600-->00:4:28,600
Oh, you'll do it. It's a piece of cake.

54
00:4:28,600-->00:4:30,600
Excuse me, Richard, Marilyn.

55
00:4:30,600-->00:4:34,600
You are a terrific instructor, Jack.

56
00:4:34,600-->00:4:37,600
Thanks. But I have a question.

57
00:4:37,600-->00:4:41,600
Is this your very first advanced aerobics class?

58
00:4:41,600-->00:4:43,600
Yes, it is.

59
00:4:43,600-->00:4:45,600
You are in great shape, Richard.

60
00:4:45,600-->00:4:48,600
Very few people last in this class

61
00:4:48,600-->00:4:51,600
for the full hour the very first time.

62
00:4:51,600-->00:4:55,600
It's true. You are in great shape.

63
00:4:55,600-->00:4:57,600
Thanks!

64
00:4:57,600-->00:5:2,600
I think we'll cook dinner together.
