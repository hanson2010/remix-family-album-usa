1
00:1:0,600-->00:1:3,600
Don't worry, Alexandra.

2
00:1:3,600-->00:1:4,600
We'll find the owner.

3
00:1:4,600-->00:1:5,600
How, Robbie?

4
00:1:5,600-->00:1:7,600
Let me think.

5
00:1:7,600-->00:1:9,600
Gemma, sit. Gemma

6
00:1:9,600-->00:1:10,600
Good Gemma.

7
00:1:10,600-->00:1:11,600
Give me your paw.

8
00:1:11,600-->00:1:13,600
Good Gemma.

9
00:1:13,600-->00:1:14,600
This dog is well trained.

10
00:1:14,600-->00:1:16,600
She likes you, too.

11
00:1:16,600-->00:1:18,600
So how are we going to find the owners?

12
00:1:18,600-->00:1:20,600
With a little help from the ASPCA,

13
00:1:20,600-->00:1:25,600
the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

14
00:1:25,600-->00:1:26,600
They're the ones.

15
00:1:26,600-->00:1:28,600
We once found a cat.

16
00:1:28,600-->00:1:30,600
She was caught in the branches of our tree.

17
00:1:30,600-->00:1:31,600
And Dad called the ASPCA.

18
00:1:31,600-->00:1:33,600
They came and solved the problem.

19
00:1:33,600-->00:1:35,600
Robbie, let's call them. Robbie

20
00:1:35,600-->00:1:42,600
Let me see -- ASPCA....

21
00:1:42,600-->00:1:48,600
Here it is.

22
00:1:48,600-->00:1:50,600
ASPCA Animal Shelter. ASPCA

23
00:1:50,600-->00:1:55,600
555-7700.

24
00:1:55,600-->00:2:8,600
(beep...)

25
00:2:8,600-->00:2:11,600
Hello, ASPCA.

26
00:2:11,600-->00:2:14,600
Hello, my name is Robbie Stewart.

27
00:2:14,600-->00:2:16,600
I have a lost dog I'd like to bring to you.

28
00:2:16,600-->00:2:18,600
How late are you open?

29
00:2:18,600-->00:2:19,600
We're open till nine P.M.

30
00:2:19,600-->00:2:20,600
Thank you.

31
00:2:20,600-->00:2:22,600
I'll bring the dog over by nine.

32
00:2:22,600-->00:2:23,600
Thanks.

33
00:2:23,000-->00:2:23,600
Bye.

34
00:2:23,600-->00:2:24,600
Thanks.

35
00:2:24,600-->00:2:25,600
Good-bye.

36
00:2:25,600-->00:2:32,600

37
00:2:32,600-->00:2:34,600
They're still open?

38
00:2:34,600-->00:2:35,600
They're open until nine o'clock.

39
00:2:35,600-->00:2:37,600
We have two and a half hours.

40
00:2:37,600-->00:2:39,600
Let's take Gemma by there now.

41
00:2:39,600-->00:2:40,600
They'll find the owner.

42
00:2:40,600-->00:2:42,600
I hope so.

43
00:2:42,600-->00:2:46,600
I'm so sad to see this little dog without her family.

44
00:2:46,600-->00:2:48,600
I'm sure they'll find the owner.

45
00:2:48,600-->00:2:51,600
But if they don't, I'll adopt her.

46
00:2:51,600-->00:2:53,600
She's so cute.

47
00:2:53,600-->00:2:57,600
Look at those eyes.

48
00:2:57,600-->00:2:59,600
She's hard to resist.

49
00:2:59,600-->00:3:1,600
Don't you just love her?

50
00:3:1,600-->00:3:5,600
I'd like to keep her, too.

51
00:3:5,600-->00:3:7,600
But I'll be going home to Greece

52
00:3:7,600-->00:3:9,600
at the end of the semester.

53
00:3:9,600-->00:3:12,600
She just wants love and affection.

54
00:3:12,600-->00:3:17,600
Come on, Robbie.

55
00:3:17,600-->00:3:18,600
Let's get her to the animal shelter,

56
00:3:18,600-->00:3:20,600
so they can find her owners quickly.

57
00:3:20,600-->00:3:22,600
Don't worry, Gemma.

58
00:3:22,600-->00:3:24,600
We'll get you home.

59
00:3:24,600-->00:3:26,600
It's not easy being away from home.

60
00:3:26,600-->00:3:28,600
Come on, poochie.

61
00:3:28,600-->00:3:29,600
Atta girl!

62
00:3:29,600-->00:3:31,600
Let's go.

63
00:3:31,600-->00:3:34,600
We're off to the animal shelter.

64
00:3:34,600-->00:3:57,600
let's thank taotao

65
00:3:57,600-->00:3:58,600
Your name?

66
00:3:58,600-->00:3:59,600
Robbie Stewart. Robbie Stewart

67
00:3:59,600-->00:4:1,600
And this is Alexandra Pappas.

68
00:4:1,600-->00:4:4,600
Your name will do, Mr. Stewart.

69
00:4:4,600-->00:4:8,600
Your address?

70
00:4:8,600-->00:4:12,600
46 Linden street, Riverdale. Riverdale

71
00:4:12,600-->00:4:16,600
Where did you find the dog?

72
00:4:16,600-->00:4:18,600
She found us.

73
00:4:18,600-->00:4:20,600
You tried calling the number on the collar?

74
00:4:20,600-->00:4:23,600
Yes, but the number's no longer in service.

75
00:4:23,600-->00:4:26,600
And there's no address on the dog tag?

76
00:4:26,600-->00:4:28,600
There's no other information.

77
00:4:28,600-->00:4:30,600
No ID number.

78
00:4:30,600-->00:4:33,600
Without that, it's hard.

79
00:4:33,600-->00:4:36,600
You will try to find the dog's owner.

80
00:4:36,600-->00:4:38,600
Oh, we'll try, believe me.

81
00:4:38,600-->00:4:41,600
And if you don't?

82
00:4:41,600-->00:4:42,600
Yes?

83
00:4:42,600-->00:4:47,600
If you don't ... can I ... can I adopt the dog?

84
00:4:47,600-->00:4:48,600
Why, yes.

85
00:4:48,600-->00:4:51,600
If the owners don't claim the dog in forty-eight hours,

86
00:4:51,600-->00:4:53,600
then you can apply for adoption.

87
00:4:53,600-->00:4:54,600
How do I do that?

88
00:4:54,600-->00:4:56,600
You really want to?

89
00:4:56,600-->00:4:57,600
Yes, I'm serious.

90
00:4:57,600-->00:5:0,600
If no one comes to claim Gemma,

91
00:5:0,600-->00:5:1,600
I'd like to adopt her.

92
00:5:1,600-->00:5:3,600
It's not difficult.
