1
00:0:55,600-->00:0:57,600
How about some music?

2
00:0:57,600-->00:1:0,600
No, let's wait till Robbie gets back from the airport.

3
00:1:0,600-->00:1:2,600
Did she say why she had to leave today?

4
00:1:2,600-->00:1:4,600
She told Robbie that her flight tomorrow was canceled,

5
00:1:4,600-->00:1:6,600
so she had to take an earlier flight today.

6
00:1:6,600-->00:1:8,600
This is terrible.

7
00:1:8,600-->00:1:11,600
Well, that must be him.

8
00:1:11,600-->00:1:12,600
Why is he blowing his horn like that?

9
00:1:12,600-->00:1:13,600
I don't know.

10
00:1:13,600-->00:1:14,600
Maybe he's angry.

11
00:1:14,600-->00:1:16,600
Do you think we should take down the decorations?

12
00:1:16,600-->00:1:17,600
They'll just make him sad.

13
00:1:17,600-->00:1:18,600
Too late now.

14
00:1:18,600-->00:1:19,600
We should have done it sooner.

15
00:1:19,600-->00:1:21,600
Oh, here he comes.

16
00:1:21,600-->00:1:23,600
Hi.

17
00:1:23,600-->00:1:24,600
How'd it go?

18
00:1:24,600-->00:1:27,600
OK, I guess.

19
00:1:27,600-->00:1:30,600
Especially when Alexandra gave me a surprise ...

20
00:1:30,600-->00:1:31,600
Yeah? What was it?

21
00:1:31,600-->00:1:32,600
This!

22
00:1:32,600-->00:1:35,600
Alexandra! Alexandra

23
00:1:35,600-->00:1:40,600
Hi! What happened?

24
00:1:40,600-->00:1:44,600
I called my parents from the airport.

25
00:1:44,600-->00:1:45,600
When I told them

26
00:1:45,600-->00:1:47,600
my friends were giving me a party,

27
00:1:47,600-->00:1:48,600
they insisted that I stay.

28
00:1:48,600-->00:1:51,600
So now I'm taking a flight on Monday instead.

29
00:1:51,600-->00:1:53,600
That's great! Terrific!

30
00:1:53,600-->00:1:55,600
But how did you know the party was for you?

31
00:1:55,600-->00:1:57,600
Well, Robbie told me when he gave me this.

32
00:1:57,600-->00:2:0,600
Oh, it's so pretty!

33
00:2:0,600-->00:2:2,600
It's lovely, Robbie.

34
00:2:2,600-->00:2:3,600
All right!

35
00:2:3,600-->00:2:4,600
Now we can really start the party!

36
00:2:4,600-->00:2:6,600
No. Would you mind?

37
00:2:6,600-->00:2:7,600
I'd like to say something first.

38
00:2:7,600-->00:2:8,600
Hear, hear!

39
00:2:8,600-->00:2:12,600
I would just like to thank all of you,

40
00:2:12,600-->00:2:13,600
my friends,

41
00:2:13,600-->00:2:17,600
who have made my stay in the United States so wonderful.

42
00:2:17,600-->00:2:21,600
And to Robbie and the Stewart family

43
00:2:21,600-->00:2:22,600
for opening their home to me.

44
00:2:22,600-->00:2:25,600
We should thank you.

45
00:2:25,600-->00:2:26,600
You're a real friend!

46
00:2:26,600-->00:2:30,600
And I also have a little surprise for you, Robbie.

47
00:2:30,600-->00:2:33,600
A little going-away present.

48
00:2:33,600-->00:2:34,600
Thank you.

49
00:2:34,600-->00:2:35,600
Open it, please.

50
00:2:35,600-->00:2:38,600
I think you might be amused.

51
00:2:38,600-->00:2:43,600
OK. I can't believe it!

52
00:2:43,600-->00:2:46,600
I guess we were thinking the same thought.

53
00:2:46,600-->00:2:48,600
You had it engraved!

54
00:2:48,600-->00:2:50,600
Read it, Robbie.

55
00:2:50,600-->00:2:54,600
"In friendship, always. Alexandra."

56
00:2:54,600-->00:2:55,600
I knew we thought alike,

57
00:2:55,600-->00:2:56,600
but this is too much!

58
00:2:56,600-->00:2:58,600
Thank you.

59
00:2:58,600-->00:2:59,600
All right!

60
00:2:59,600-->00:3:1,600
Let's have some music!

61
00:3:1,600-->00:3:11,600
Miss Pappas? Pappas

62
00:3:11,600-->00:3:12,600
Mr. Stewart ... Stewart

63
00:3:12,600-->00:3:16,600
Mrs. Stewart, may I have this dance? Stewart

64
00:3:16,600-->00:3:17,600
My pleasure, Doctor.

65
00:3:17,600-->00:3:40,600
