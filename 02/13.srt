00:2:12,600-->00:2:16,600
Hi, Grandpa.

2
00:2:16,600-->00:2:18,600
Hi, Robbie.

3
00:2:18,600-->00:2:19,600
Can I help?

4
00:2:19,600-->00:2:21,600
Yes, indeed.

5
00:2:21,600-->00:2:24,600
Hand me two eggs from the refrigerator,

6
00:2:24,600-->00:2:27,600
and I'll make you two fried eggs.

7
00:2:27,600-->00:2:31,600
How about some bacon?

8
00:2:31,600-->00:2:33,600
I made enough for an army.

9
00:2:33,600-->00:2:36,600
You going to the baseball game today?

10
00:2:36,600-->00:2:42,600
It's a perfect day for it, a little cloudy but nice and warm.

11
00:2:42,600-->00:2:44,600
Dad and I were planning to go to the game,

12
00:2:44,600-->00:2:45,600
but he has to work today,

13
00:2:45,600-->00:2:47,600
and my friends don't want to go.

14
00:2:47,600-->00:2:49,600
It's not an important game, anyway.

15
00:2:49,600-->00:2:52,600
Do you have any other plans for the day?

16
00:2:52,600-->00:2:54,600
I'll work on my computer.

17
00:2:54,600-->00:2:58,600
I have a new math program, and I want to learn how to use it.

18
00:2:58,600-->00:3:0,600
Maybe you can teach me

19
00:3:0,600-->00:3:1,600
how to work on a computer someday.

20
00:3:1,600-->00:3:5,600
Anytime. It's really easy, but, like anything,

21
00:3:5,600-->00:3:7,600
you need to work at it, Grandpa.

22
00:3:7,600-->00:3:11,600
This bacon is great.

23
00:3:11,600-->00:3:12,600
I love crispy bacon.

24
00:3:12,600-->00:3:15,600
Oh, what are you doing tomorrow?

25
00:3:15,600-->00:3:17,600
Nothing much.

26
00:3:17,600-->00:3:23,600
Well, maybe your dad and I could take you fishing with us.

27
00:3:23,600-->00:3:25,600
I'd like that, but...

28
00:3:25,600-->00:3:27,600
But what?

29
00:3:27,600-->00:3:29,600
But Dad is always so busy.

30
00:3:29,600-->00:3:34,600
Well, can you come fishing with me tomorrow?

31
00:3:34,600-->00:3:37,600
Sure, I can.

32
00:3:37,600-->00:3:42,600
Robbie says you can't take him to the game today.

33
00:3:42,600-->00:3:44,600
I really feel bad about it,

34
00:3:44,600-->00:3:46,600
but they need me at the hospital today,

35
00:3:46,600-->00:3:47,600
in the children's ward.

36
00:3:47,600-->00:3:48,600
I understand.

37
00:3:48,600-->00:3:52,600
Maybe we can spend some time together next weekend.

38
00:3:52,600-->00:3:54,600
Definitely.

39
00:3:54,600-->00:3:55,600
We should.

40
00:3:55,600-->00:3:57,600
You and Robbie and me.

41
00:3:57,600-->00:4:0,600
Remember our first fishing trip?

42
00:4:0,600-->00:4:1,600
I sure do...

43
00:4:1,600-->00:4:6,600
Well, I've got to run, Dad.

44
00:4:6,600-->00:4:7,600
See you later.

45
00:4:7,600-->00:4:10,600
Going fishing?

46
00:4:10,600-->00:4:12,600
I'm thinking about it...

47
00:4:12,600-->00:4:16,600
So, how's work?

48
00:4:16,600-->00:4:18,600
Oh, the usual problems.

49
00:4:18,600-->00:4:21,600
You're working pretty hard these days.

50
00:4:21,600-->00:4:22,600
I guess I am.

51
00:4:22,600-->00:4:29,600
When did you last go fishing with Robbie?

52
00:4:29,600-->00:4:32,600
I remember exactly.

53
00:4:32,600-->00:4:35,600
It was on his birthday, June second, two years ago.

54
00:4:35,600-->00:4:39,600
We didn't catch anything.

55
00:4:39,600-->00:4:42,600
Remember our fishing trips?

56
00:4:42,600-->00:4:45,600
Yes. I loved them.

57
00:4:45,600-->00:4:50,600
Remember catching your first fish?

58
00:4:50,600-->00:4:53,600
How can I forget?

59
00:4:53,600-->00:4:54,600
I fell out of the boat!

60
00:4:54,600-->00:4:59,600
We had some good times together.

61
00:4:59,600-->00:5:1,600
Yes, we did.

62
00:5:1,600-->00:5:4,600
Maybe we should do it again.

63
00:5:4,600-->00:5:7,600
How about tomorrow?

64
00:5:7,600-->00:5:10,600
Don't you have to work?

65
00:5:10,600-->00:5:12,600
My paper work will wait.

66
00:5:12,600-->00:5:15,600
Oh, Robbie will be thrilled.

67
00:5:15,600-->00:5:17,600
I am, too, Son.

68
00:5:17,600-->00:5:19,600
I want to spend more time with Robbie.

69
00:5:19,600-->00:5:20,600
Tomorrow.

70
00:5:20,600-->00:5:23,600
It'll be like old times for you and me.

71
00:5:23,600-->00:5:25,600
And Robbie will love it.

72
00:5:25,600-->00:5:29,600
Well, what's the weather going to be like?

73
00:5:29,600-->00:5:33,600
Radio says sunny and mild.

74
00:5:33,600-->00:5:39,600
Well, I'll tell Robbie.

75
00:5:39,600-->00:5:45,600
And thanks, Dad.

76
00:5:45,600-->00:5:47,600
Don't thank me.

77
00:5:47,600-->00:5:50,600
I'm just being a grandfather.
