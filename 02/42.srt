1
00:0:35,600-->00:0:38,600
There's a conversation we have to finish.

2
00:0:38,600-->00:0:40,600
What was it about?

3
00:0:40,600-->00:0:42,600
It was about caring.

4
00:0:42,600-->00:0:44,600
Oh?

5
00:0:44,600-->00:0:47,600
Yes, caring.

6
00:0:47,600-->00:0:50,600
I said that it makes me feel good

7
00:0:50,600-->00:0:51,600
that you care about Michelle.

8
00:0:51,600-->00:0:54,600
Well, I do care about Michelle.

9
00:0:54,600-->00:0:57,600
And it makes me feel good that you care about me.

10
00:0:57,600-->00:0:59,600
You know I do.

11
00:0:59,600-->00:1:4,600
You're a ... wonderful friend.

12
00:1:4,600-->00:1:7,600
And it makes me feel good

13
00:1:7,600-->00:1:9,600
that you care about us.

14
00:1:9,600-->00:1:14,600
Well ... well,

15
00:1:14,600-->00:1:15,600
I do, Harry.

16
00:1:15,600-->00:1:19,600
It's only natural that if I care about Michelle

17
00:1:19,600-->00:1:21,600
and I care about you,

18
00:1:21,600-->00:1:24,600
then I care about us.

19
00:1:24,600-->00:1:25,600
It's OK, Susan.

20
00:1:25,600-->00:1:27,600
We had this part of the conversation

21
00:1:27,600-->00:1:28,600
before Michelle and her friends arrived.

22
00:1:28,600-->00:1:30,600
Now comes the good part.

23
00:1:30,600-->00:1:31,600
Like what?

24
00:1:31,600-->00:1:35,600
Well, assume that if you care about Michelle

25
00:1:35,600-->00:1:36,600
and you care about me

26
00:1:36,600-->00:1:39,600
and you care about us,

27
00:1:39,600-->00:1:41,600
that we can talk about us.

28
00:1:41,600-->00:1:43,600
I mean--you and me.

29
00:1:43,600-->00:1:47,600
Isn't that right?

30
00:1:47,600-->00:1:51,600
What are you trying to say, Harry?

31
00:1:51,600-->00:1:56,600
What I'm trying to say ...

32
00:1:56,600-->00:2:0,600
since this is so easy ....

33
00:2:0,600-->00:2:27,600
Here are ten letters that express my feelings for you.

34
00:2:27,600-->00:2:29,600
Don't be silly, Harry.

35
00:2:29,600-->00:2:31,600
You want a hint?

36
00:2:31,600-->00:2:32,600
It's two words.

37
00:2:32,600-->00:2:34,600
You're making the game harder.

38
00:2:34,600-->00:2:38,600
Can't you figure it out?

39
00:2:38,600-->00:2:40,600
Seven letters ... two words ...

40
00:2:40,600-->00:2:43,600
that express the feelings that I feel for you in my heart.

41
00:2:43,600-->00:2:46,600
Harry, I get it! Harry

42
00:2:46,600-->00:3:3,600

43
00:3:3,600-->00:3:6,600
Well? Does that mean you'll marry me?

44
00:3:6,600-->00:3:11,600
Is that a proposal, or are we just playing a game?

45
00:3:11,600-->00:3:18,600
Sit down, Susan.

46
00:3:18,600-->00:3:24,600
There's something I have to ask you.

47
00:3:24,600-->00:3:43,600
Susan, will you marry me? Susan

48
00:3:43,600-->00:3:46,600
It's such an important decision.

49
00:3:46,600-->00:3:49,600
There's so many things to talk about.

50
00:3:49,600-->00:3:52,600
There are three things that have to be done first, Harry.

51
00:3:52,600-->00:3:55,600
Three things?

52
00:3:55,600-->00:3:58,600
First, we have to decide where to live.

53
00:3:58,600-->00:3:59,600
Well, that's easy.

54
00:3:59,600-->00:4:0,600
We talked about that earlier.

55
00:4:0,600-->00:4:1,600
We'll live in New York.

56
00:4:1,600-->00:4:3,600
All right.

57
00:4:3,600-->00:4:4,600
Second,

58
00:4:4,600-->00:4:8,600
we have to talk to Michelle together about being married.

59
00:4:8,600-->00:4:10,600
We'll do that immediately.

60
00:4:10,600-->00:4:12,600
What's the third thing?

61
00:4:12,600-->00:4:15,600
You have to ask for my father's permission.

62
00:4:15,600-->00:4:16,600
Absolutely!

63
00:4:16,600-->00:4:19,600
But first things first.

64
00:4:19,600-->00:4:21,600
We have to go pick up Michelle.

65
00:4:21,600-->00:4:25,600
Oh, I'm so happy, Harry!

66
00:4:25,600-->00:4:30,600
Not as happy as I am.
