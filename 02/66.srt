00:0:54,600-->00:0:57,600
Hi, big guy.

2
00:0:57,600-->00:0:59,600
That must be Rita Mae.

3
00:0:59,600-->00:1:1,600
She sure got here quickly.

4
00:1:1,600-->00:1:2,600
That's a good sign.

5
00:1:2,600-->00:1:4,600
She must like you and your work, Marilyn.

6
00:1:4,600-->00:1:6,600
I think she's just anxious to see Max.

7
00:1:6,600-->00:1:7,600
She loves children.

8
00:1:7,600-->00:1:16,600

9
00:1:16,600-->00:1:18,600
Hi, Marilyn.

10
00:1:18,600-->00:1:21,600
Welcome.

11
00:1:21,600-->00:1:23,600
It's so nice of you to come.

12
00:1:23,600-->00:1:26,600
Oh, I just wanted to see your baby, Max.

13
00:1:26,600-->00:1:28,600
Hello, Rita Mae.

14
00:1:28,600-->00:1:30,600
I haven't seen you since the hospital.

15
00:1:30,600-->00:1:33,600
I'm Ellen Stewart, Marilyn's mother-in-law.

16
00:1:33,600-->00:1:34,600
We met at the hospital.

17
00:1:34,600-->00:1:35,600
How are you?

18
00:1:35,600-->00:1:36,600
How are you?

19
00:1:36,600-->00:1:39,600
Oh, and there is Max!

20
00:1:39,600-->00:1:43,600
Oh! My, how he's grown!

21
00:1:43,600-->00:1:47,600
A little present for Max.

22
00:1:47,600-->00:1:51,600
Oh, it's beautiful, Rita Mae!

23
00:1:51,600-->00:1:52,600
You shouldn't have.

24
00:1:52,600-->00:1:53,600
It's nothing.

25
00:1:53,600-->00:1:54,600
It's just a little present for Max.

26
00:1:54,600-->00:1:58,600
Can I get you some coffee or tea or a cold drink, Rita Mae?

27
00:1:58,600-->00:1:59,600
Oh, nothing, thank you.

28
00:1:59,600-->00:2:3,600
Well, I will leave you two to talk.

29
00:2:3,600-->00:2:5,600
Come on, you big guy.

30
00:2:5,600-->00:2:6,600
Yes, come on.

31
00:2:6,600-->00:2:8,600
That's it.

32
00:2:8,600-->00:2:9,600
It's nice seeing you.

33
00:2:9,600-->00:2:11,600
Let me know if you need anything.

34
00:2:11,600-->00:2:12,600
Thanks, Ellen.

35
00:2:12,600-->00:2:13,600
Thanks, Ellen.

36
00:2:13,600-->00:2:18,600
OK, Marilyn.

37
00:2:18,600-->00:2:20,600
You sounded like you've made a decision

38
00:2:20,600-->00:2:21,600
when you called me.

39
00:2:21,600-->00:2:24,600
I have made a decision, Rita Mae.

40
00:2:24,600-->00:2:26,600
I've decided to stay at home and be a full-time mother.

41
00:2:26,600-->00:2:30,600
I'm disappointed, but I respect your decision.

42
00:2:30,600-->00:2:33,600
If I had a child as cute as Max,

43
00:2:33,600-->00:2:34,600
I might do the same thing.

44
00:2:34,600-->00:2:36,600
But I haven't finished telling you

45
00:2:36,600-->00:2:37,600
the other half of my decision.

46
00:2:37,600-->00:2:38,600
The other half?

47
00:2:38,600-->00:2:39,600
Yes.

48
00:2:39,600-->00:2:41,600
I think I can stay at home

49
00:2:41,600-->00:2:44,600
and take care of Max and continue my career.

50
00:2:44,600-->00:2:47,600
Sounds interesting.

51
00:2:47,600-->00:2:49,600
Let me hear it.

52
00:2:49,600-->00:2:50,600
Do you remember

53
00:2:50,600-->00:2:52,600
our talks about custom-designed dresses for the boutique?

54
00:2:52,600-->00:2:53,600
I sure do.

55
00:2:53,600-->00:2:58,600
Why can't I design dresses for you here at home?

56
00:2:58,600-->00:3:0,000
And make them here.

57
00:3:0,000-->00:3:1,900
Have the fittings here, too.

58
00:3:1,900-->00:3:5,000
And I could do the selling and the pricing at the boutique.

59
00:3:5,000-->00:3:5,600
Exactly.

60
00:3:5,600-->00:3:7,600
Oh!

61
00:3:7,600-->00:3:9,600
What kind of dresses would you design?

62
00:3:9,600-->00:3:13,600
I've thought about that for some time.

63
00:3:13,600-->00:3:15,600
Yes?

64
00:3:15,600-->00:3:17,600
Wedding dresses.

65
00:3:17,600-->00:3:18,600
Wedding dresses?

66
00:3:18,600-->00:3:21,600
Brilliant idea!

67
00:3:21,600-->00:3:24,600
There's a big market today in wedding dresses.

68
00:3:24,600-->00:3:25,600
That's what I thought.

69
00:3:25,600-->00:3:26,600
I like the idea very much.

70
00:3:26,600-->00:3:28,600
And if it's successful,

71
00:3:28,600-->00:3:30,600
we can expand to all kinds of dresses.

72
00:3:30,600-->00:3:32,600
That's what I thought.

73
00:3:32,600-->00:3:34,600
As a matter of fact,

74
00:3:34,600-->00:3:37,600
I have a customer for your first wedding dress.

75
00:3:37,600-->00:3:39,600
My niece is getting married,

76
00:3:39,600-->00:3:42,600
and I've been trying to find just the right thing for her.

77
00:3:42,600-->00:3:45,600
Marilyn, you're going to design my niece's dress. Marilyn

78
00:3:45,600-->00:3:47,600
That'll be our first one,

79
00:3:47,600-->00:3:49,600
and then we'll use it to sell others.

80
00:3:49,600-->00:3:51,600
Do you really mean it?

81
00:3:51,600-->00:3:52,600
I really mean it.

82
00:3:52,600-->00:3:54,600
It's a simple idea, and it will work.

83
00:3:54,600-->00:3:57,600
You can certainly design dresses.

84
00:3:57,600-->00:3:58,600
I know that.

85
00:3:58,600-->00:4:1,600
And there's no reason why you can't do it from your home.

86
00:4:1,600-->00:4:3,600
I'm so excited!

87
00:4:3,600-->00:4:4,600
I can't wait to tell Richard!

88
00:4:4,600-->00:4:7,600
If I had a baby like Max,

89
00:4:7,600-->00:4:10,600
I'd want to stay home and be near him all the time, too.

90
00:4:10,600-->00:4:13,600
You're making the right decision

91
00:4:13,600-->00:4:15,600
for Max and for yourself too, Marilyn.

92
00:4:15,600-->00:4:17,600
It all sounds so easy.

93
00:4:17,600-->00:4:19,600
Now the hard work begins.

94
00:4:19,600-->00:4:20,600
Would you like

95
00:4:20,600-->00:4:23,600
to see some of my designs that I've been working on?

96
00:4:23,600-->00:4:24,600
I'd love to.

97
00:4:24,600-->00:4:30,600
Ooh! Oh, that's wonderful!

98
00:4:30,600-->00:4:32,600
Ooh...
