1
00:2:5,600-->00:2:8,600
Ellen, I'd like your opinion. Ellen

2
00:2:8,600-->00:2:9,600
About what?

3
00:2:9,600-->00:2:15,600
Well, Richard and I feel that with a baby coming

4
00:2:15,600-->00:2:20,600
we need to have our own place to live.

5
00:2:20,600-->00:2:24,600
Oh.

6
00:2:24,600-->00:2:27,600
Well, what do you think about Richard and me

7
00:2:27,600-->00:2:29,600
looking for a small house or an apartment

8
00:2:29,600-->00:2:31,600
at this point in our lives?

9
00:2:31,600-->00:2:35,600
We love having you here,

10
00:2:35,600-->00:2:37,600
and there is room,

11
00:2:37,600-->00:2:39,600
and ... and when the baby comes,

12
00:2:39,600-->00:2:41,600
the baby can stay in your room for a while.

13
00:2:41,600-->00:2:45,600
Richard feels we need to find a small house. Richard

14
00:2:45,600-->00:2:53,600
I remember when I was pregnant with Richard.

15
00:2:53,600-->00:2:58,600
Philip and I were living with Grandma and Grandpa. Philip

16
00:2:58,600-->00:2:59,600
Philip was a young doctor, Philip

17
00:2:59,600-->00:3:2,600
and he kept talking about having a house of our own.

18
00:3:2,600-->00:3:5,600
It's natural.

19
00:3:5,600-->00:3:6,600
What did you do?

20
00:3:6,600-->00:3:10,600
We looked at a lot of houses.

21
00:3:10,600-->00:3:12,600
Did you find one?

22
00:3:12,600-->00:3:14,600
Oh, not at first.

23
00:3:14,600-->00:3:15,600
We couldn't afford it.

24
00:3:15,600-->00:3:19,600
Grandpa wanted to lend us the money to buy one,

25
00:3:19,600-->00:3:22,600
but Philip is too independent.

26
00:3:22,600-->00:3:24,600
He didn't want to borrow any money.

27
00:3:24,600-->00:3:27,600
Sounds like Richard.

28
00:3:27,600-->00:3:28,600
They're all alike.

29
00:3:28,600-->00:3:31,600
Richard is a real Stewart. Richard

30
00:3:31,600-->00:3:34,600
He's independent,

31
00:3:34,600-->00:3:38,600
and sometimes just stubborn.

32
00:3:38,600-->00:3:42,600
When did you buy a house?

33
00:3:42,600-->00:3:44,600
After Richard was born.

34
00:3:44,600-->00:3:47,600
I was teaching music,

35
00:3:47,600-->00:3:51,600
and Philip was opening his first medical office.

36
00:3:51,600-->00:3:52,600
Where was the house?

37
00:3:52,600-->00:3:55,600
Right here in Riverdale.

38
00:3:55,600-->00:3:56,600
Of course, it was a small house,

39
00:3:56,600-->00:3:59,600
but just right for us.

40
00:3:59,600-->00:4:4,600
It's funny. History repeats itself.

41
00:4:4,600-->00:4:7,600
Now Richard and I are having a baby,

42
00:4:7,600-->00:4:9,600
and we probably won't be able to

43
00:4:9,600-->00:4:10,600
afford a house right away, either.

44
00:4:10,600-->00:4:14,600
Why don't you look at some houses, Marilyn?

45
00:4:14,600-->00:4:16,600
Good idea.

46
00:4:16,600-->00:4:21,600
Look in the real-estate section of Sunday's Times.

47
00:4:21,600-->00:4:22,600
You'll learn a lot.

48
00:4:22,600-->00:4:24,600
Maybe we should

49
00:4:24,600-->00:4:27,600
speak to a real-estate agent about a house.

50
00:4:27,600-->00:4:29,600
And a bank about a mortgage.

51
00:4:29,600-->00:4:31,600
I'll talk to Richard about it.

52
00:4:31,600-->00:4:34,600
I think it's a good idea, Ellen.

53
00:4:34,600-->00:4:35,600
We can learn a lot by asking.

54
00:4:35,600-->00:4:38,600
And if I can be of any help,

55
00:4:38,600-->00:4:39,600
let me know.

56
00:4:39,600-->00:4:41,600
As a matter of fact,

57
00:4:41,600-->00:4:44,600
my friend Virginia Martinelli is a real-estate agent.

58
00:4:44,600-->00:4:45,600
Good.

59
00:4:45,600-->00:4:47,600
You won't believe this,

60
00:4:47,600-->00:4:49,600
but she sold us our first house and this one.

61
00:4:49,600-->00:4:52,600
Well, I'll tell Richard,

62
00:4:52,600-->00:4:53,600
and we'll go to see her.

63
00:4:53,600-->00:5:3,600
Do you think the skirt length is right, Ellen?

64
00:5:3,600-->00:5:6,600
Do you think it's too long?

65
00:5:6,600-->00:5:10,600
I think the skirt is just right.

66
00:5:10,600-->00:5:14,600
Are you planning to attach a train to it?

67
00:5:14,600-->00:5:17,600
No. No train. Just the dress.

68
00:5:17,600-->00:5:21,600
But I am going to make a headpiece of lace.

69
00:5:21,600-->00:5:24,600
That dress is gorgeous.

70
00:5:24,600-->00:5:26,600
Thanks, Ellen.

71
00:5:26,600-->00:5:29,600
And thanks for the advice about the house.

72
00:5:29,600-->00:5:31,600
I'll talk to Richard about it

73
00:5:31,600-->00:5:32,600
the minute he comes home.

74
00:5:32,600-->00:5:34,600
And remember,

75
00:5:34,600-->00:5:37,600
we love having you here.

76
00:5:37,600-->00:5:41,600
There's no need to rush.
