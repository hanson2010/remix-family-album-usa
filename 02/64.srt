00:1:57,600-->00:2:3,600
"Rock-a-bye, baby, on the tree top,

2
00:2:3,600-->00:2:6,600
When the wind blows,

3
00:2:6,600-->00:2:10,600
The cradle will rock.

4
00:2:10,600-->00:2:13,600
When the bough breaks,

5
00:2:13,600-->00:2:17,600
The cradle will fall,

6
00:2:17,600-->00:2:22,600
And down will come baby,

7
00:2:22,600-->00:2:26,600
Cradle and all."

8
00:2:26,600-->00:2:39,600

9
00:2:39,600-->00:2:41,600
Hi, Marilyn,

10
00:2:41,600-->00:2:43,600
What are you doing?

11
00:2:43,600-->00:2:47,600
Just sketching.

12
00:2:47,600-->00:2:55,600
I've been thinking a lot about our responsibilities

13
00:2:55,600-->00:2:57,600
in the past few weeks.

14
00:2:57,600-->00:2:58,600
I never stop thinking about them.

15
00:2:58,600-->00:3:0,600
I've been wrestling

16
00:3:0,600-->00:3:4,600
with the question of whether I go back to work or not.

17
00:3:4,600-->00:3:5,600
I see.

18
00:3:5,600-->00:3:6,600
And I'm torn.

19
00:3:6,600-->00:3:8,600
I really want to go back to work,

20
00:3:8,600-->00:3:10,600
use my talents,

21
00:3:10,600-->00:3:12,600
and pursue my career in fashion design

22
00:3:12,600-->00:3:14,600
like we always thought I would.

23
00:3:14,600-->00:3:15,600
But now ...

24
00:3:15,600-->00:3:18,600
I want to be with Max as a full-time mother,

25
00:3:18,600-->00:3:20,600
especially when he's a baby.

26
00:3:20,600-->00:3:23,600
I really understand, Marilyn.

27
00:3:23,600-->00:3:25,600
But you never have to worry about Max.

28
00:3:25,600-->00:3:27,600
There's Mother and Grandpa ...

29
00:3:27,600-->00:3:29,600
and I can always arrange my photo schedule

30
00:3:29,600-->00:3:30,600
around your schedule,

31
00:3:30,600-->00:3:31,600
if that will help.

32
00:3:31,600-->00:3:35,600
It's not the same, Richard.

33
00:3:35,600-->00:3:41,600
Have you discussed going back to work with your boss?

34
00:3:41,600-->00:3:43,600
Rita Mae called yesterday. Rita Mae

35
00:3:43,600-->00:3:47,600
Ah! That's what's got you thinking, isn't it?

36
00:3:47,600-->00:3:48,600
She wants to know

37
00:3:48,600-->00:3:51,600
when I think I'll be returning to the boutique.

38
00:3:51,600-->00:3:52,600
And you said ... ?

39
00:3:52,600-->00:3:55,600
I said I'd give her an answer in a few days ...

40
00:3:55,600-->00:3:58,600
that I wasn't sure.

41
00:3:58,600-->00:4:1,600
I'm sure Rita Mae will understand

42
00:4:1,600-->00:4:3,600
and wait until you're ready to go back to work.

43
00:4:3,600-->00:4:7,000
Well, maybe she will, and maybe she won't.

44
00:4:7,000-->00:4:8,000
Who knows?

45
00:4:8,000-->00:4:10,600
If I don't accept her offer,

46
00:4:10,600-->00:4:13,600
maybe she'll find someone else in the meantime,

47
00:4:13,600-->00:4:14,600
and when I'm ready to go back,

48
00:4:14,600-->00:4:15,600
there won't be a job for me.

49
00:4:15,600-->00:4:17,600
That's something to consider.

50
00:4:17,600-->00:4:19,600
You've got yourself to think about, too.

51
00:4:19,600-->00:4:22,600
But I am thinking about myself.

52
00:4:22,600-->00:4:23,600
Don't you see?

53
00:4:23,600-->00:4:24,600
What do you mean?

54
00:4:24,600-->00:4:26,600
It's not just the job.

55
00:4:26,600-->00:4:34,600
It's also my career as Max's mother.

56
00:4:34,600-->00:4:37,600
That's the way I look at it.

57
00:4:37,600-->00:4:41,600
I have two career opportunities at the same time.

58
00:4:41,600-->00:4:43,600
My career as a fashion designer

59
00:4:43,600-->00:4:44,600
and my career as a mother.

60
00:4:44,600-->00:4:50,600
I never really thought about being a mother as a career.

61
00:4:50,600-->00:4:54,600
I guess you do have two career opportunities

62
00:4:54,600-->00:4:57,600
and a decision to make.

63
00:4:57,600-->00:5:1,600
I hear Max.

64
00:5:1,600-->00:5:2,600
I'll do it.
