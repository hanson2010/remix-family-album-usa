00:0:41,600-->00:0:45,600
Sorry, Robbie.

2
00:0:45,600-->00:0:47,600
Sorry to be late this morning,but,

3
00:0:47,600-->00:0:50,600
well, we've still got some time for a cup of coffee

4
00:0:50,600-->00:0:52,600
I can't wait to see my old pal Charley Rafer.

5
00:0:52,600-->00:0:53,600
Neither can I.

6
00:0:53,600-->00:1:8,600
So you thought about it, huh?

7
00:1:8,600-->00:1:10,600
Yes, I have, Dad.

8
00:1:10,600-->00:1:11,600
Well, I'm glad.

9
00:1:11,600-->00:1:13,600
I knew you'd realize

10
00:1:13,600-->00:1:15,600
that this interview could be an important experience for you.

11
00:1:15,600-->00:1:17,600
I came to that conclusion.

12
00:1:17,600-->00:1:20,600
That's very wise, Robbie.

13
00:1:20,600-->00:1:22,600
Very wise.

14
00:1:22,600-->00:1:26,600
Now let's head off for the city and the university club.

15
00:1:26,600-->00:1:28,600
Thanks, Dad.

16
00:1:28,600-->00:1:30,600
Thanks ... for what?

17
00:1:30,600-->00:1:32,600
Thanks for hearing me out. And ...

18
00:1:32,600-->00:1:34,600
And ...?

19
00:1:34,600-->00:1:37,600
And thanks for being such an understanding father.

20
00:1:37,600-->00:1:41,600
Well, thank you, Robbie. Thank you.

21
00:1:41,600-->00:1:56,600
Philip Stewart! Philip Stewart

22
00:1:56,600-->00:1:58,600
It's great to see you!

23
00:1:58,600-->00:2:3,600
Charley Rafer--you look as young as ever. Charley Rafer

24
00:2:3,600-->00:2:6,600
You must be Robbie.

25
00:2:6,600-->00:2:7,600
Hi.

26
00:2:7,600-->00:2:11,600
Yes, this is my youngest son Robbie.

27
00:2:11,600-->00:2:13,600
Robbie, I want you to meet Robbie

28
00:2:13,600-->00:2:16,600
one of the best tennis players on the Michigan team--

29
00:2:16,600-->00:2:17,600
Charley Rafer. Charley Rafer

30
00:2:17,600-->00:2:19,600
Nice to meet you, Dean Rafer.

31
00:2:19,600-->00:2:22,600
Well, are you as good a tennis player as your dad?

32
00:2:22,600-->00:2:24,600
No, I'm not very good at it.

33
00:2:24,600-->00:2:26,600
Frankly, neither was I.

34
00:2:26,600-->00:2:29,600
Charley was the star of the team. Charley

35
00:2:29,600-->00:2:31,600
Yeah. Thanks.

36
00:2:31,600-->00:2:32,600
Well, how're you been, Philip?

37
00:2:32,600-->00:2:35,600
Oh, working too hard.

38
00:2:35,600-->00:2:36,600
Doesn't show.

39
00:2:36,600-->00:2:37,600
How's Ellen? Ellen

40
00:2:37,600-->00:2:39,600
Fine, thank you.

41
00:2:39,600-->00:2:41,600
And how's Marge? Marge

42
00:2:41,600-->00:2:45,600
She's still giving the toughest English history exams

43
00:2:45,600-->00:2:48,600
in the school and loving every minute of it.

44
00:2:48,600-->00:2:50,600
And speaking of minutes,

45
00:2:50,600-->00:2:52,600
I have interviews until noon,

46
00:2:52,600-->00:2:54,600
so why don't we get right to work?

47
00:2:54,600-->00:2:58,600
Can you have lunch with us later?

48
00:2:58,600-->00:3:0,600
I'd love to, Philip, but I'm afraid I can't.

49
00:3:0,600-->00:3:1,600
I'm only here two days,

50
00:3:1,600-->00:3:3,600
and I have interviews with twenty-six applicants.

51
00:3:3,600-->00:3:5,600
I understand.

52
00:3:5,600-->00:3:6,600
Well, thanks.

53
00:3:6,600-->00:3:8,600
I'll wait outside.

54
00:3:8,600-->00:3:10,600
Good luck, Son.

55
00:3:10,600-->00:3:13,600
Did you bring your transcript from high school?

56
00:3:13,600-->00:3:14,600
Yes, sir.

57
00:3:14,600-->00:3:15,600
Right here.

58
00:3:15,600-->00:3:16,600
Thank you.

59
00:3:16,600-->00:3:18,600
Please sit down.

60
00:3:18,600-->00:3:24,600
I see under "activities" that

61
00:3:24,600-->00:3:16,600
you've been writing for the school paper.

62
00:3:16,600-->00:3:27,600
Yes, sir.

63
00:3:27,600-->00:3:30,600
What kinds of articles have you written?

64
00:3:30,600-->00:3:34,600
All kinds--sports, editorials, theater reviews.

65
00:3:34,600-->00:3:36,600
You name it, I've written it.

66
00:3:36,600-->00:3:38,600
Hmmm.

67
00:3:38,600-->00:3:40,600
Well, have you ever thought of becoming a journalist?

68
00:3:40,600-->00:3:42,600
A professional writer?

69
00:3:42,600-->00:3:44,600
Not until recently.

70
00:3:44,600-->00:3:47,600
Michigan has a fine School of Journalism. Michigan

71
00:3:47,600-->00:3:50,600
Yes, I know that.

72
00:3:50,600-->00:3:53,600
You seem to have some reservations.

73
00:3:53,600-->00:3:55,600
I'm a little uncertain.

74
00:3:55,600-->00:3:59,600
It's been very nice talking to you.

75
00:3:59,600-->00:4:1,600
Nice talking to you, sir.

76
00:4:1,600-->00:4:3,600
One piece of advice.

77
00:4:3,600-->00:4:9,600
The most important thing is for you to decide your own future.

78
00:4:9,600-->00:4:10,600
Yes, sir.

79
00:4:10,600-->00:4:13,600
Good-bye, Dean Rafer.

80
00:4:13,600-->00:4:14,600
Good-bye, Robbie.

81
00:4:14,600-->00:4:16,600
Good luck.
