1
00:2:0,600-->00:2:2,600
A little further to the right, Tom.

2
00:2:2,600-->00:2:3,600
Is this OK?

3
00:2:3,600-->00:2:5,600
Good. What do you think, Richard?

4
00:2:5,600-->00:2:6,600
I like it there.

5
00:2:6,600-->00:2:9,600
It's the first thing people will see when they come in.

6
00:2:9,600-->00:2:11,600
It sets the tone for the whole show.

7
00:2:11,600-->00:2:13,600
The next thing they'll see is

8
00:2:13,600-->00:2:16,600
this enlargement with the words Family Album, U.S.A.

9
00:2:16,600-->00:2:19,600
I can't believe this is really happening!

10
00:2:19,600-->00:2:20,600
You've earned it.

11
00:2:20,600-->00:2:22,600
Years of work went into these pictures.

12
00:2:22,600-->00:2:25,600
I know, but it's still a dream come true.

13
00:2:25,600-->00:2:26,600
Well, remember,

14
00:2:26,600-->00:2:27,600
we're not sure

15
00:2:27,600-->00:2:29,600
what the critics are going to write about your show yet.

16
00:2:29,600-->00:2:31,600
And you never know

17
00:2:31,600-->00:2:34,600
what the man from the New York Times is going to say about it.

18
00:2:34,600-->00:2:35,600
Are you worried?

19
00:2:35,600-->00:2:36,600
I always worry.

20
00:2:36,600-->00:2:38,600
The reviews of this show

21
00:2:38,600-->00:2:40,600
are important for the sales of your book.

22
00:2:40,600-->00:2:42,600
When do we see the reviews?

23
00:2:42,600-->00:2:43,600
Soon.

24
00:2:43,600-->00:2:45,600
One of the critics is coming over this morning for a preview.

25
00:2:45,600-->00:2:47,600
I hope he's in a good mood.

26
00:2:47,600-->00:2:48,600
So do I.

27
00:2:48,600-->00:2:53,600
Marilyn and I hope to use money from the sales of this book

28
00:2:53,600-->00:2:54,600
to buy a new house.

29
00:2:54,600-->00:2:56,600
The book will be a success.

30
00:2:56,600-->00:2:57,600
And the show will help promote it.

31
00:2:57,600-->00:3:1,600
Speaking of promoting the book,

32
00:3:1,600-->00:3:2,600
do I really have to

33
00:3:2,600-->00:3:5,600
autograph copies for the guests at the opening?

34
00:3:5,600-->00:3:6,600
It's common practice.

35
00:3:6,600-->00:3:9,600
I feel uncomfortable about it.

36
00:3:9,600-->00:3:11,600
A lot of people come to openings

37
00:3:11,600-->00:3:12,600
just so they can get

38
00:3:12,600-->00:3:15,600
the autograph of somebody who may be famous someday.

39
00:3:15,600-->00:3:17,600
Couldn't we wait until I'm famous?

40
00:3:17,600-->00:3:19,600
That might be sooner than you think.

41
00:3:19,600-->00:3:21,600
This one over here, Mr. Carlson?

42
00:3:21,600-->00:3:24,600
A little further back, Tom.

43
00:3:24,600-->00:3:25,600
It's too close to the refreshments.

44
00:3:25,600-->00:3:28,600
No, I think this one belongs in the "people-at-work" section.

45
00:3:28,600-->00:3:31,600
You may be right.

46
00:3:31,600-->00:3:32,600
Try it there, Tom.

47
00:3:32,600-->00:3:33,600
Right.

48
00:3:33,600-->00:3:36,600
Nervous about the opening tonight?

49
00:3:36,600-->00:3:37,600
Nervous?

50
00:3:37,600-->00:3:41,600
No. I'm scared to death.

51
00:3:41,600-->00:3:42,600
How about guests?

52
00:3:42,600-->00:3:44,600
How many people will you be bringing?

53
00:3:44,600-->00:3:47,600
Well, my family, I guess.

54
00:3:47,600-->00:3:50,600
My wife Marilyn, my father and mother,

55
00:3:50,600-->00:3:52,600
my brother Robbie,

56
00:3:52,600-->00:3:54,600
my sister and her husband and their daughter.

57
00:3:54,600-->00:3:55,600
And my grandfather.

58
00:3:55,600-->00:3:57,600
Is that too many?

59
00:3:57,600-->00:3:59,600
No such thing as "too many" at an opening.

60
00:3:59,600-->00:4:1,600
I hope they like it.

61
00:4:1,600-->00:4:4,600
Your family or the public?

62
00:4:4,600-->00:4:6,600
Everybody.

63
00:4:6,600-->00:4:8,600
But especially my family.

64
00:4:8,600-->00:4:10,600
They've stood by me through all this.

65
00:4:10,600-->00:4:11,600
I'm sure they'll like it.

66
00:4:11,600-->00:4:14,600
Harvey, how are you?

67
00:4:14,600-->00:4:16,600
Mitchell, so nice of you to come.

68
00:4:16,600-->00:4:18,600
Richard, this is Mitchell Johnson.

69
00:4:18,600-->00:4:20,600
Mitchell is

70
00:4:20,600-->00:4:22,600
one of the most important syndicated reviewers in the country.

71
00:4:22,600-->00:4:25,600
Well, you're the young man who did all this.

72
00:4:25,600-->00:4:27,600
I'm afraid so.

73
00:4:27,600-->00:4:28,600
Nice to meet you.

74
00:4:28,600-->00:4:29,600
Nice to meet you, Mr. Johnson.

75
00:4:29,600-->00:4:32,600
Mitchell has always encouraged new talent.

76
00:4:32,600-->00:4:34,600
Well ... you mind if I look around

77
00:4:34,600-->00:4:35,600
and see what it says to me?

78
00:4:35,600-->00:4:36,600
Be our guest.

79
00:4:36,600-->00:5:28,600

80
00:5:28,600-->00:5:33,600
Mm-hmm, hmm, uh-huh.

81
00:5:33,600-->00:5:40,600
What does that mean when he goes,

82
00:5:40,600-->00:5:42,600
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm"?

83
00:5:42,600-->00:5:45,600
It probably means he's clearing his throat.

84
00:5:45,600-->00:5:46,600
I don't know.

85
00:5:46,600-->00:5:49,600
I don't care what the critics say, Mr. Stewart.

86
00:5:49,600-->00:5:50,600
Your work is brilliant.

87
00:5:50,600-->00:5:51,600
Thank you, Tom.

88
00:5:51,600-->00:5:54,600
Tom is studying photography at NYU. Tom

89
00:5:54,600-->00:5:57,600
He's working with me during the summer months as an intern.

90
00:5:57,600-->00:5:58,600
Oh, really?

91
00:5:58,600-->00:5:59,600
I'd like to see your work.

92
00:5:59,600-->00:6:0,600
It's not good enough to show.

93
00:6:0,600-->00:6:1,600
I'm still learning.

94
00:6:1,600-->00:6:2,600
Oh, I'd still like to see your work.

95
00:6:2,600-->00:6:4,600
You may be the next Ansel Adams and not even know it.

96
00:6:4,600-->00:6:5,600
If you really mean it,

97
00:6:5,600-->00:6:7,600
I'll bring some of my pictures into the gallery.

98
00:6:7,600-->00:6:8,600
I do mean it.

99
00:6:8,600-->00:6:12,600
Very interesting pictures, Mr. Stewart.

100
00:6:12,600-->00:6:14,600
You have a most unusual eye.

101
00:6:14,600-->00:6:15,600
Thank you.

102
00:6:15,600-->00:6:17,600
I hope that's a compliment.

103
00:6:17,600-->00:6:18,600
It is.

104
00:6:18,600-->00:6:20,600
Are you going to be reviewing the show, Mitchell?

105
00:6:20,600-->00:6:22,600
Oh, yes. It's definitely worth reviewing.

106
00:6:22,600-->00:6:24,600
Favorably?

107
00:6:24,600-->00:6:26,600
Oh, you know I never answer that question, Harvey.

108
00:6:26,600-->00:6:28,600
I'd like an advance copy of the book, though,

109
00:6:28,600-->00:6:29,600
so I can study it.

110
00:6:29,600-->00:6:32,600
I have an autographed one in my office.

111
00:6:32,600-->00:6:36,600
Tom, would you give Mr. Johnson

112
00:6:36,600-->00:6:37,600
the copy of Richard's book on my desk?

113
00:6:37,600-->00:6:38,600
Just follow me, Mr. Johnson.

114
00:6:38,600-->00:6:39,600
Sure.

115
00:6:39,600-->00:6:44,600
Do you think he liked my photographs?

116
00:6:44,600-->00:6:46,600
We'll know when tonight's papers come out.

117
00:6:46,600-->00:6:49,600
Keep your fingers crossed.
