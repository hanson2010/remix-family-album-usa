1
00:0:22,600-->00:0:46,600
OK, everybody.

2
00:0:46,600-->00:0:50,600
I want to welcome Harry and his daughter Michelle

3
00:0:50,600-->00:0:51,600
to Thanksgiving with us.

4
00:0:51,600-->00:0:53,600
Thank you, Dr. Stewart.

5
00:0:53,600-->00:0:54,600
Call me Philip.

6
00:0:54,600-->00:0:55,600
OK.

7
00:0:55,600-->00:0:57,600
But first, I think we should take a moment

8
00:0:57,600-->00:0:59,600
and remember the meaning of Thanksgiving.

9
00:0:59,600-->00:1:3,600
Philip, I took Michelle to a school play Philip

10
00:1:3,600-->00:1:4,600
about the first Thanksgiving.

11
00:1:4,600-->00:1:6,600
Well, why don't you tell us about that, Michelle?

12
00:1:6,600-->00:1:8,600
Thanksgiving was about the Pilgrims,

13
00:1:8,600-->00:1:10,600
the first settlers in America.

14
00:1:10,600-->00:1:12,600
They shared the first harvest with the Indians

15
00:1:12,600-->00:1:13,600
and gave thanks.

16
00:1:13,600-->00:1:15,600
All right.

17
00:1:15,600-->00:1:18,600
Then in that spirit let each of us give thanks.

18
00:1:18,600-->00:1:20,600
Each in his own way.

19
00:1:20,600-->00:1:22,600
Who wants to begin?

20
00:1:22,600-->00:1:23,600
I will.

21
00:1:23,600-->00:1:29,600
I give thanks for being here with my family and for being well,

22
00:1:29,600-->00:1:31,600
so I can enjoy you all.

23
00:1:31,600-->00:1:32,600
All right!

24
00:1:32,600-->00:1:33,600
We love you, Grandpa.

25
00:1:33,600-->00:1:41,600
I'd like to give thanks for a healthy year, a good job,

26
00:1:41,600-->00:1:45,600
and for meeting Harry and Michelle.

27
00:1:45,600-->00:1:47,600
We'd like to give thanks for meeting Susan

28
00:1:47,600-->00:1:48,600
and the Stewart family.

29
00:1:48,600-->00:1:49,600
I love you, Daddy.

30
00:1:49,600-->00:1:51,600
Thanks, Harry.

31
00:1:51,600-->00:1:53,600
That was very kind of you.

32
00:1:53,600-->00:1:56,600
I'd like to give thanks for Grandpa coming to live with us.

33
00:1:56,600-->00:1:59,600
And I'd also like to thank my math teacher

34
00:1:59,600-->00:2:1,600
for giving me a passing grade.

35
00:2:1,600-->00:2:4,600
And call me, Alexandra.

36
00:2:4,600-->00:2:6,600
Oh, Robbie!

37
00:2:6,600-->00:2:8,600
She'll call.

38
00:2:8,600-->00:2:10,600
You go first, Marilyn.

39
00:2:10,600-->00:2:11,600
I'm thinking.

40
00:2:11,600-->00:2:12,600
You go first.

41
00:2:12,600-->00:2:18,600
Well, you all know I'm working on my photo album.

42
00:2:18,600-->00:2:20,600
It's not finished yet.

43
00:2:20,600-->00:2:23,600
And I'd like to thank Marilyn for being so patient.

44
00:2:23,600-->00:2:26,600
Thanks, Richard.

45
00:2:26,600-->00:2:28,600
I should thank you for encouraging me

46
00:2:28,600-->00:2:30,600
to keep working on my fashion designs.

47
00:2:30,600-->00:2:33,600
I'm lucky to have a husband with an artistic eye.

48
00:2:33,600-->00:2:39,600
Oh, we have a lot to be thankful for.

49
00:2:39,600-->00:2:42,600
For the food on this table.

50
00:2:42,600-->00:2:43,600
Just like the Pilgrims.

51
00:2:43,600-->00:2:46,600
I'll go along with that, Ellen.

52
00:2:46,600-->00:2:48,600
Well, help me serve, Robbie.

53
00:2:48,600-->00:2:53,600
It was a wonderful meal, Mrs. Stewart.

54
00:2:53,600-->00:2:54,600
Thank you.

55
00:2:54,600-->00:2:56,600
And now to see the end of the football game.

56
00:2:56,600-->00:2:57,600
Exactly.

57
00:2:57,600-->00:2:59,600
Where are you going, Philip?

58
00:2:59,600-->00:3:2,600
Remember, the Michigan football game?

59
00:3:2,600-->00:3:4,600
And Michigan needs a touchdown.

60
00:3:4,600-->00:3:6,600
Did you forget something?

61
00:3:6,600-->00:3:8,600
Dad, your famous apple pie.

62
00:3:8,600-->00:3:11,600
Just let me see the score, Ellen.

63
00:3:11,600-->00:3:12,600
Go ahead, Philip.

64
00:3:12,600-->00:3:14,600
We should all take a little break before dessert.

65
00:3:14,600-->00:3:29,600
Oh, who could that be?

66
00:3:29,600-->00:3:31,600
Oh, it must be Alexandra.

67
00:3:31,600-->00:3:33,600
I invited her to come by for dessert.

68
00:3:33,600-->00:3:34,600
You did?

69
00:3:34,600-->00:3:36,600
I like Ellen.

70
00:3:36,600-->00:3:37,600
You know everyone, Alexandra.

71
00:3:37,600-->00:3:41,600
No, she doesn't know Harry Bennett and his daughter Michelle.

72
00:3:41,600-->00:3:42,600
Nice to meet you.

73
00:3:42,600-->00:3:43,600
Hi.

74
00:3:43,600-->00:3:44,600
Hi.

75
00:3:44,600-->00:3:45,600
Hello, Alexandra.

76
00:3:45,600-->00:3:46,600
Hi, Marilyn.

77
00:3:46,600-->00:3:47,000
Hi, Susan.

78
00:3:47,000-->00:3:47,600
Happy Thanksgiving.

79
00:3:47,600-->00:3:50,600
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie.

80
00:3:50,600-->00:3:51,600
Please sit down, Alexandra.

81
00:3:51,600-->00:3:55,600
Dad, Richard, Alexandra's here.

82
00:3:55,600-->00:3:57,600
Michigan needs a touchdown.

83
00:3:57,600-->00:3:59,600
Three minutes to play.

84
00:3:59,600-->00:4:1,600
Hi, Alexandra. Welcome.

85
00:4:1,600-->00:4:2,600
Hello, Alexandra.

86
00:4:2,600-->00:4:4,600
Yes, Michigan needs a touchdown.

87
00:4:4,600-->00:4:7,600
One tiny little touchdown, with just three minutes to play.

88
00:4:7,600-->00:4:9,600
You want Michigan to win.

89
00:4:9,600-->00:4:10,600
How'd you guess?

90
00:4:10,600-->00:4:13,600
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie.

91
00:4:13,600-->00:4:26,600
What happened?

92
00:4:26,600-->00:4:29,600
We forgot to turn the oven on.

93
00:4:29,600-->00:4:33,600
We did?

94
00:4:33,600-->00:4:35,600
Philip, why don't you go

95
00:4:35,600-->00:4:37,600
watch the last three minutes of the game.

96
00:4:37,600-->00:4:40,600
I will serve coffee and pumpkin pie.

97
00:4:40,600-->00:4:42,600
OK. I'll be back in a few minutes.

98
00:4:42,600-->00:4:46,600
Robbie, would you bring the dessert plates.

99
00:4:46,600-->00:4:48,600
And, Marilyn, would you pour coffee, please.

100
00:4:48,600-->00:4:49,600
Sure, Ellen.

101
00:4:49,600-->00:4:55,600
How was your Thanksgiving dinner, Alexandra?

102
00:4:55,600-->00:4:57,600
Just wonderful, Mr. Stewart.

103
00:4:57,600-->00:5:0,600
The Molinas are a large family.

104
00:5:0,600-->00:5:1,601
I love being with them.

105
00:5:1,600-->00:5:3,602
I'm glad you came by, Alexandra.

106
00:5:3,600-->00:5:4,603
I am, too.

107
00:5:4,600-->00:5:12,604
Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!

108
00:5:12,600-->00:5:15,605
Great Thanksgiving.

109
00:5:15,600-->00:5:16,606
Lots to be thankful for.

110
00:5:16,600-->00:5:19,607
Michigan scored a touchdown.

111
00:5:19,600-->00:5:21,608
Alexandra came by.

112
00:5:21,600-->00:5:25,609
And nobody misses Philip's famous apple pie.

113
00:5:25,600-->00:5:28,610
Oh, Grandpa!
