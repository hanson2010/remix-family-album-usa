1
00:2:24,600-->00:2:26,600
I am exhausted. My new exercise class is so hard.

2
00:2:26,600-->00:2:32,600
Your new exercise class?

3
00:2:32,600-->00:2:38,600
Yeah. My new advanced exercise class.

4
00:2:38,600-->00:2:44,600
Why advanced?

5
00:2:44,600-->00:2:49,600
My instructor thought that

6
00:2:49,600-->00:2:50,600
the beginner's class was too easy for me.

7
00:2:50,600-->00:2:54,600
Too easy for you?

8
00:2:54,600-->00:2:59,600
Don't laugh. In the beginner's class,

9
00:2:59,600-->00:3:2,600
they give you a chance to rest between exercises.

10
00:3:2,600-->00:3:3,600
So?

11
00:3:3,600-->00:3:6,600
The advanced class is nonstop.

12
00:3:6,600-->00:3:11,600
I lift weights every morning for sixty minutes

13
00:3:11,600-->00:3:12,600
without stopping.

14
00:3:12,600-->00:3:13,600
No problem.

15
00:3:13,600-->00:3:17,600
Listen, Richard,

16
00:3:17,600-->00:3:22,600
doing aerobics for an hour is a lot different than lifting weights.

17
00:3:22,600-->00:3:24,600
Yeah. Quite a bit different.

18
00:3:24,600-->00:3:25,600
I think aerobics is easy.

19
00:3:25,600-->00:3:28,600
I could work out in your class with no problem.

20
00:3:28,600-->00:3:33,600
You think so?

21
00:3:33,600-->00:3:34,600
Oh, without a doubt.

22
00:3:34,600-->00:3:36,600
When's the next class?

23
00:3:36,600-->00:3:41,600
Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock. Try it.

24
00:3:41,600-->00:3:47,600
Tomorrow morning after lifting weights,

25
00:3:47,600-->00:3:48,600
I'll try aerobics.

26
00:3:48,600-->00:3:52,600
It's a nap. Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.

27
00:3:52,600-->00:4:9,600
Aren't you going to the aerobics class this morning?

28
00:4:9,600-->00:4:17,600
Of Course. Easy. No sweat.

29
00:4:17,600-->00:4:21,600
You are not going to be able to move

30
00:4:21,600-->00:4:23,600
after this and the aerobics class.

31
00:4:23,600-->00:4:25,600
Are you kidding me?

32
00:4:25,600-->00:4:28,600
It's going to be a piece of cake.

33
00:4:28,600-->00:4:32,600
You want to bet?

34
00:4:32,600-->00:4:36,600
Yeah. What's the bet?

35
00:4:36,600-->00:4:41,600
I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning

36
00:4:41,600-->00:4:42,600
and not feel a thing!

37
00:4:42,600-->00:4:52,600
The bet is, I win, and you cook dinner for the entire family.

38
00:4:52,600-->00:4:55,600
Or you win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

39
00:4:55,600-->00:4:57,600
It's a bet.

40
00:4:57,600-->00:5:1,600
Ok. Call my instructor, Jack Davis, right now.

41
00:5:1,600-->00:5:5,600
His number is 555-8842.

42
00:5:5,600-->00:5:7,600
The advanced class starts at 10 o'clock.

43
00:5:7,600-->00:5:8,600
Well, it's 8:20 now.

44
00:5:8,600-->00:5:11,600
It only takes eight minutes by bicycle to the aerobics class.

45
00:5:11,600-->00:5:13,600
Give him a call.

46
00:5:13,600-->00:5:27,600
Davis Aerobics Center for Good Health.

47
00:5:27,600-->00:5:28,600
Jack Davis, please.

48
00:5:28,600-->00:5:29,600
This is Jack Davis.

49
00:5:29,600-->00:5:31,600
Hello. This is Richard Stewart.

50
00:5:31,600-->00:5:34,600
My wife, Marilyn Stewart, is a member of your program.

51
00:5:34,600-->00:5:37,600
I'd like to come to

52
00:5:37,600-->00:5:38,600
the ten o'clock advanced class this morning.

53
00:5:38,600-->00:5:42,600
Oh, fine, fine. Be here a few minutes early.

54
00:5:42,600-->00:5:44,600
You need to complete some forms before the class.

55
00:5:44,600-->00:5:45,600
Thanks. I'm on my way over.

56
00:5:45,600-->00:5:46,600
Good-bye.

57
00:5:46,600-->00:5:55,600
Bye-bye. It's all set. I'm going.

58
00:5:55,600-->00:5:56,600
Bye.

59
00:5:56,600-->00:5:57,600
Bye.

60
00:5:57,600-->00:5:58,600
See you later.

61
00:5:58,600-->00:5:59,600
Good luck.

62
00:5:59,600-->00:6:2,600
Don't forget about the bet.

63
00:6:2,600-->00:6:5,600
Dinner for the entire family.

64
00:6:5,600-->00:6:6,600
And that includes Susan.

65
00:6:6,600-->00:6:8,600
Don't you forget.
