1
00:2:8,600-->00:2:13,600
OK, Philip. This is your third cup of coffee.

2
00:2:13,600-->00:2:16,600
We should get to work,

3
00:2:16,600-->00:2:17,600
or we won't be finished by dinnertime.

4
00:2:17,600-->00:2:20,600
I guess we must.

5
00:2:20,600-->00:2:22,600
We must.

6
00:2:22,600-->00:2:34,600
OK. The beginning of my famous Thanksgiving apple pie.

7
00:2:34,600-->00:2:41,600
One apple. Two apples. Three apples. Four apples.

8
00:2:41,600-->00:2:43,600
Come on, Philip!

9
00:2:43,600-->00:2:46,600
Get busy with your famous apple pie.

10
00:2:46,600-->00:2:47,600
There's much more to be done.

11
00:2:47,600-->00:2:53,600
Now, the ingredients.

12
00:2:53,600-->00:2:57,600
What goes into my apple pie besides apples?

13
00:2:57,600-->00:3:7,600
Ah, yes. Flour, sugar, butter.

14
00:3:7,600-->00:3:16,600
Butter, nice and cold and hard.

15
00:3:16,600-->00:3:19,600
OK, here are the walnuts.

16
00:3:19,600-->00:3:21,600
Last but not least,

17
00:3:21,600-->00:3:25,600
the reason my apple pie is famous--cinnamon.

18
00:3:25,600-->00:3:27,600
Cinnamon ...

19
00:3:27,600-->00:3:31,600
Ellen, where's the cinnamon? Ellen

20
00:3:31,600-->00:3:33,600
If there is any cinnamon,

21
00:3:33,600-->00:3:35,600
it's in the cabinet with the salt and pepper.

22
00:3:35,600-->00:3:51,600
Salt, pepper, dill weed, garlic powder, cinnamon. Ellen?

23
00:3:51,600-->00:3:52,600
Yes, Philip.

24
00:3:52,600-->00:3:55,600
Is it possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon?

25
00:3:55,600-->00:4:2,600
Yes, it is possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon.

26
00:4:2,600-->00:4:6,600
Well, how can I make my famous apple pie without cinnamon?

27
00:4:6,600-->00:4:8,600
Good morning.

28
00:4:8,600-->00:4:10,600
Oh, hi, Robbie. Good morning.

29
00:4:10,600-->00:4:12,600
Good morning. Robbie.

30
00:4:12,600-->00:4:14,600
Can you do me a favor?

31
00:4:14,600-->00:4:15,600
Sure, Dad. What?

32
00:4:15,600-->00:4:18,600
Remember my apple pie on Thanksgiving?

33
00:4:18,600-->00:4:21,600
What do you love about it?

34
00:4:21,600-->00:4:24,600
The apples?

35
00:4:24,600-->00:4:27,600
No. The sssss...

36
00:4:27,600-->00:4:31,600
Right. We don't have any cinnamon.

37
00:4:31,600-->00:4:35,600
I'll go down to Henry's grocery. He's always open.

38
00:4:35,600-->00:4:36,600
I'll get some for you.

39
00:4:36,600-->00:4:37,600
That's my boy!

40
00:4:37,600-->00:4:40,600
Oh, put your heavy jacket on, Robbie.

41
00:4:40,600-->00:4:41,600
It's cold outside.

42
00:4:41,600-->00:4:47,600
Alexandra might call. Alexandra

43
00:4:47,600-->00:4:49,600
Tell her I'll call her right back.

44
00:4:49,600-->00:4:50,600
OK.

45
00:4:50,600-->00:4:52,600
Thanks, Son.

46
00:4:52,600-->00:5:0,600
Uh, why does he always have to slam the door?

47
00:5:0,600-->00:5:17,600
Hello.... Hello, Alexandra. How are you? ... Fine.

48
00:5:17,600-->00:5:19,600
Robbie just went to the store. Robbie

49
00:5:19,600-->00:5:20,600
He'll be back soon.

50
00:5:20,600-->00:5:21,600
He said he'll call you.

51
00:5:21,600-->00:5:27,600
... Oh, oh, I see.... Oh ... certainly.

52
00:5:27,600-->00:5:29,600
Well, do you have the phone number there?

53
00:5:29,600-->00:5:35,600
... Oh ... I see.... Please, I know he wants to talk to you....

54
00:5:35,600-->00:5:37,600
Thank you,

55
00:5:37,600-->00:5:40,600
and happy Thanksgiving to you and your family, too.

56
00:5:40,600-->00:5:44,600
Try to come by later for dessert.... Bye.

57
00:5:44,600-->00:5:48,600
That was Alexandra.

58
00:5:48,600-->00:5:50,600
She and the Molinas

59
00:5:50,600-->00:5:52,600
are going to spend Thanksgiving with their cousins.

60
00:5:52,600-->00:5:54,600
She doesn't have the phone number.

61
00:5:54,600-->00:5:56,600
Oh, Robbie will be disappointed.

62
00:5:56,600-->00:5:58,600
He'll be grouchy.

63
00:5:58,600-->00:6:1,600
Maybe she'll call back. She promised.

64
00:6:1,600-->00:6:5,600
Here's your cinnamon, Pop.

65
00:6:5,600-->00:6:13,600
It was a dollar and sixty cents.

66
00:6:13,600-->00:6:19,600
You forgot to ask me for the change.

67
00:6:19,600-->00:6:23,600
Or did you forget to give it to me?

68
00:6:23,600-->00:6:31,600
Thanks, Son.

69
00:6:31,600-->00:6:35,600
Alexandra called. Alexandra

70
00:6:35,600-->00:6:36,600
I'll call her back.

71
00:6:36,600-->00:6:38,600
She said she'll call you later.

72
00:6:38,600-->00:6:39,600
She's not at home.

73
00:6:39,600-->00:6:52,600
You should have your breakfast, Son.

74
00:6:52,600-->00:6:53,600
Make you feel better.

75
00:6:53,600-->00:6:55,600
Protein, vitamins.

76
00:6:55,600-->00:6:57,600
She said she'll call back?

77
00:6:57,600-->00:6:58,600
Yes, she did.

78
00:6:58,600-->00:7:1,600
Good morning, everyone!

79
00:7:1,600-->00:7:2,600
Happy Turkey Day!

80
00:7:2,600-->00:7:5,600
What's wrong?

81
00:7:5,600-->00:7:8,600
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

82
00:7:8,600-->00:7:13,600
What's gotten into him?

83
00:7:13,600-->00:7:15,600
He missed a phone call.

84
00:7:15,600-->00:7:16,600
From ...?

85
00:7:16,600-->00:7:18,600
Yes, Alexandra.

86
00:7:18,600-->00:7:25,600
It's nice to see young love.... Oh, to be young again!

87
00:7:25,600-->00:7:27,600
Where's the coffee?
