1
00:1:0,600-->00:1:2,600
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

2
00:1:2,600-->00:1:3,600
No, it's not taken.

3
00:1:3,600-->00:1:4,600
Oh, thank you.

4
00:1:4,600-->00:1:6,600
Oh, let me help you with this.

5
00:1:6,600-->00:1:7,600
Oh, thank you.

6
00:1:7,600-->00:1:14,600
Do you want to sit by the window?

7
00:1:14,600-->00:1:17,600
No, no, no. I like the aisle seat better.

8
00:1:17,600-->00:1:19,600
Please, you sit by the window.

9
00:1:19,600-->00:1:28,600
My name is Stewart... Malcolm Stewart.

10
00:1:28,600-->00:1:29,600
Pleased to meet you.

11
00:1:29,600-->00:1:30,600
I'm Elsa Tobin. How do you do?

12
00:1:30,600-->00:1:39,600
Do you live in New York?

13
00:1:39,600-->00:1:41,600
No, no. I'm from Florida.

14
00:1:41,600-->00:1:46,600
I am, too. But didn't you just get on?

15
00:1:46,600-->00:1:49,600
No, no. I just changed my seat.

16
00:1:49,600-->00:1:51,600
A man next to me was smoking,

17
00:1:51,600-->00:1:54,600
and smoke really bothers me.

18
00:1:54,600-->00:1:58,600
Where are you from in Florida?

19
00:1:58,600-->00:2:1,600
Titusville. It's near Orlando.

20
00:2:1,600-->00:2:4,600
Small world. I'm from Titusville, too.

21
00:2:4,600-->00:2:8,600
Really? What part?

22
00:2:8,600-->00:2:10,600
My husband and I live near Spaceport.

23
00:2:10,600-->00:2:13,600
I know that area.

24
00:2:13,600-->00:2:17,600
My house is only a few miles from Spaceport.

25
00:2:17,600-->00:2:20,600
Do you still live there?

26
00:2:20,600-->00:2:22,600
Oh yes, yes. My husband's there now.

27
00:2:22,600-->00:2:26,600
He couldn't take time off to come to New York with me.

28
00:2:26,600-->00:2:30,600
Do you still live there?

29
00:2:30,600-->00:2:35,600
No. I sold the house and the furniture,

30
00:2:35,600-->00:2:40,600
put a few personal things in an old trunk,

31
00:2:40,600-->00:2:43,600
and shipped it to my children in New York.

32
00:2:43,600-->00:2:45,600
That's my destination.

33
00:2:45,600-->00:2:47,600
Are you married?

34
00:2:47,600-->00:2:50,600
My wife died four years ago.

35
00:2:50,600-->00:2:54,600
She was a wonderful woman. A real friend.

36
00:2:54,600-->00:2:59,600
I'm sorry. Really, I'm sorry.

37
00:2:59,600-->00:3:2,600
Lots of wonderful memories.

38
00:3:2,600-->00:3:5,600
We were married almost fifty years.

39
00:3:5,600-->00:3:8,600
Well, forty-seven, to be exact.

40
00:3:8,600-->00:3:12,600
John and I celebrate our fortieth anniversary next month.

41
00:3:12,600-->00:3:15,600
Oh, congratulations! That's nice.

42
00:3:15,600-->00:3:19,600
What does John do?

43
00:3:19,600-->00:3:21,600
He's an aerospace engineer

44
00:3:21,600-->00:3:23,600
and works for Orlando Aircraft Corporation.

45
00:3:23,600-->00:3:29,600
He started with them almost forty years ago.

46
00:3:29,600-->00:3:31,600
What do you do?

47
00:3:31,600-->00:3:36,600
I just retired. Had my own company.

48
00:3:36,600-->00:3:42,600
A construction company. Roads, bridges, big stuff.

49
00:3:42,600-->00:3:47,600
But I just sold it and retired.

50
00:3:47,600-->00:3:53,600
Excuse me, ma'am. Ticket, please.

51
00:3:53,600-->00:3:59,600
Would you kindly hold these keys, please?

52
00:3:59,600-->00:4:2,600
I have a ticket, I know.

53
00:4:2,600-->00:4:5,600
I was in the smoking section.

54
00:4:5,600-->00:4:6,600
It's OK, lady. Take your time.

55
00:4:6,600-->00:4:10,600
I'm sure it's in your purse, Mrs. Tobin.

56
00:4:10,600-->00:4:13,600
Oh, here it is.

57
00:4:13,600-->00:4:18,600
And here are your keys.

58
00:4:18,600-->00:4:19,600
Thank you.

59
00:4:19,600-->00:4:27,600
Do you have family in New York?

60
00:4:27,600-->00:4:32,600
No, no. But I do have very close friends in New York City.

61
00:4:32,600-->00:4:35,600
We like to go to the theater together.

62
00:4:35,600-->00:4:38,600
You said you have family in New York.

63
00:4:38,600-->00:4:40,600
Yes, indeed.

64
00:4:40,600-->00:4:44,600
A son and his wife and their three children -

65
00:4:44,600-->00:4:45,600
my grandchildren.

66
00:4:45,600-->00:4:47,600
You must be excited.

67
00:4:47,600-->00:4:50,600
I can't wait, to see them!

68
00:4:50,600-->00:4:52,600
Are you going to live with them?

69
00:4:52,600-->00:4:53,600
Yes.

70
00:4:53,600-->00:4:54,600
Permanently?

71
00:4:54,600-->00:4:59,600
Well... they want me to,

72
00:4:59,600-->00:5:2,600
but it's too early to know for sure.

73
00:5:2,600-->00:5:3,600
I'm pretty independent.

74
00:5:3,600-->00:5:8,600
I tried to teach my kids the importance of independence,

75
00:5:8,600-->00:5:13,600
but I'm not sure I want to be alone.

76
00:5:13,600-->00:5:19,600
Some people don't mind being alone. I do.

77
00:5:19,600-->00:5:24,600
I understand. But tell me.

78
00:5:24,600-->00:5:26,600
Why did you stop working?

79
00:5:26,600-->00:5:35,600
I retired because... I wanted to be with my family.

80
00:5:35,600-->00:5:40,600
I didn't want to be alone anymore!
