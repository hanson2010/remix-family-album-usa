1
00:1:22,600-->00:1:25,600
Don't tell me.

2
00:1:25,600-->00:1:27,600
Please don't tell me.

3
00:1:27,600-->00:1:29,600
I recognize you...

4
00:1:29,600-->00:1:31,600
Oh, don't be silly, Arnie.

5
00:1:31,600-->00:1:32,600
Of course you recognize him.

6
00:1:32,600-->00:1:35,600
Except for the beard, he hasn't changed in fifty years.

7
00:1:35,600-->00:1:36,600
It's Malcolm Stewart!

8
00:1:36,600-->00:1:37,600
I know it's Malcolm Stewart.

9
00:1:37,600-->00:1:40,600
You haven't changed much in fifty years.

10
00:1:40,600-->00:1:44,600
Peggy... Peggy Pendleton!

11
00:1:44,600-->00:1:46,600
You're Peggy Pendleton!

12
00:1:46,600-->00:1:47,600
Who am I, you old rascal?

13
00:1:47,600-->00:1:49,600
You don't recognize me, do you?

14
00:1:49,600-->00:1:51,600
I know who you are.

15
00:1:51,600-->00:1:53,600
You're Arnold Franklin!

16
00:1:53,600-->00:1:55,600
I know who you are!

17
00:1:55,600-->00:1:59,600
You look wonderful, Malcolm!

18
00:1:59,600-->00:2:5,600
Sit down. Sit down.

19
00:2:5,600-->00:2:7,600
Pete isn't home. Pete

20
00:2:7,600-->00:2:8,600
Really?

21
00:2:8,600-->00:2:11,600
No. He left a note on the door

22
00:2:11,600-->00:2:14,600
saying he was going to the railroad station

23
00:2:14,600-->00:2:16,600
to pick up a surprise.

24
00:2:16,600-->00:2:17,600
He's so funny.

25
00:2:17,600-->00:2:18,600
Always full of surprises,

26
00:2:18,600-->00:2:20,600
even fifty years later.

27
00:2:20,600-->00:2:24,600
The two of you look unbelievable!

28
00:2:24,600-->00:2:26,600
How's your family?

29
00:2:26,600-->00:2:27,600
Oh, I was sorry

30
00:2:27,600-->00:2:29,600
to hear about your wife having passed away.

31
00:2:29,600-->00:2:31,600
Yes. About four years ago.

32
00:2:31,600-->00:2:34,600
And you're living with your children now? In New York?

33
00:2:34,600-->00:2:36,600
Pete wrote us and told us.

34
00:2:36,600-->00:2:37,600
Yup.

35
00:2:37,600-->00:2:40,600
Retired and moved to New York

36
00:2:40,600-->00:2:43,600
to live with my son and his family.

37
00:2:43,600-->00:2:44,600
By the way,

38
00:2:44,600-->00:2:46,600
what do you think this big surprise is?

39
00:2:46,600-->00:2:49,600
It could be most anything, knowing Pete.

40
00:2:49,600-->00:2:53,600
Hey, that must be Pete!

41
00:2:53,600-->00:2:57,600
Now we'll find out about the surprise.

42
00:2:57,600-->00:3:1,600
So good to see you all!

43
00:3:1,600-->00:3:3,600
Oh, Pete, Pete!

44
00:3:3,600-->00:3:6,600
Oh, it's so good to see you!

45
00:3:6,600-->00:3:8,600
Remember Lillian?

46
00:3:8,600-->00:3:10,600
I remember all of you.

47
00:3:10,600-->00:3:12,600
You haven't changed a bit.

48
00:3:12,600-->00:3:16,600
Lillian! Oh, my gosh!

49
00:3:16,600-->00:3:17,600
Lillian Winters.

50
00:3:17,600-->00:3:19,600
We were together in the Thursday night drama society.

51
00:3:19,600-->00:3:21,600
Remember me, Malcolm?

52
00:3:21,600-->00:3:23,600
Oh, beautiful as ever, Lillian.

53
00:3:23,600-->00:3:25,600
How's Donald?

54
00:3:25,600-->00:3:27,600
That's OK, Malcolm.

55
00:3:27,600-->00:3:30,600
Donald passed away a couple of years ago.

56
00:3:30,600-->00:3:31,600
Sorry to hear that, Lillian.

57
00:3:31,600-->00:3:32,600
Oh, I'm so sorry.

58
00:3:32,600-->00:3:34,600
I would not have missed this get-together for the world!

59
00:3:34,600-->00:3:36,600
And your little surprise, Pete?

60
00:3:36,600-->00:3:38,600
You really surprised me

61
00:3:38,600-->00:3:40,600
by having us all come together.

62
00:3:40,600-->00:3:43,600
You don't know what the surprise is yet?

63
00:3:43,600-->00:3:46,600
Come on!

64
00:3:46,600-->00:3:49,600
We'll tell you the big surprise.

65
00:3:49,600-->00:3:57,600
I've invited you here for the weekend to help celebrate.

66
00:3:57,600-->00:3:58,600
Celebrate?

67
00:3:58,600-->00:3:59,600
Our fiftieth reunion?

68
00:3:59,600-->00:4:0,600
No.

69
00:4:0,600-->00:4:2,600
No. Pete wants to tell you ...

70
00:4:2,600-->00:4:4,600
Now, let me have the honor, Lillian.

71
00:4:4,600-->00:4:6,600
For goodness' sake, Pete, tell us!

72
00:4:6,600-->00:4:8,600
I can't wait much longer.

73
00:4:8,600-->00:4:13,600
Well, I am pouring this iced tea

74
00:4:13,600-->00:4:17,600
so that we can toast Lillian and me.

75
00:4:17,600-->00:4:20,600
You don't mean to tell me that you and...

76
00:4:20,600-->00:4:22,600
Yes, I do.

77
00:4:22,600-->00:4:25,600
I have loved Lillian all these years,

78
00:4:25,600-->00:4:30,600
so I asked her to be Mrs. Pete Waters.

79
00:4:30,600-->00:4:32,600
And I said yes.

80
00:4:32,600-->00:4:35,600
I knew it! I knew it!

81
00:4:35,600-->00:4:37,600
Congratulations!

82
00:4:37,600-->00:4:38,600
Oh, Lillian,

83
00:4:38,600-->00:4:39,600
I am so happy for you both.

84
00:4:39,600-->00:4:40,600
It's wonderful!

85
00:4:40,600-->00:4:42,600
It's wonderful for me.

86
00:4:42,600-->00:4:46,600
Lillian will make me a happy man, finally.

87
00:4:46,600-->00:4:48,600
You are full of surprises, Pete.

88
00:4:48,600-->00:4:50,600
We are going to

89
00:4:50,600-->00:4:55,600
spend the entire weekend having a good time together here

90
00:4:55,600-->00:4:56,600
on the farm.

91
00:4:56,600-->00:4:59,600
We are going to celebrate all weekend.

92
00:4:59,600-->00:5:0,600
When is the wedding?

93
00:5:0,600-->00:5:3,600
That's another surprise.

94
00:5:3,600-->00:5:7,600
Lillian and I were married two weeks ago in Detroit.

95
00:5:7,600-->00:5:9,600
She's come here to stay.

96
00:5:9,600-->00:5:12,600
Wait till I tell my family about this!

97
00:5:12,600-->00:5:15,600
Why, that's wonderful!
