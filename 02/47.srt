00:1:15,600-->00:1:17,600
Hello. What can I do for you?

2
00:1:17,600-->00:1:19,600
Hi. Fill 'er up.

3
00:1:19,600-->00:1:20,600
I need a full tank.

4
00:1:20,600-->00:1:21,600
Check the hood?

5
00:1:21,600-->00:1:23,600
No, thanks.

6
00:1:23,600-->00:1:33,600
Whereabouts are you headed?

7
00:1:33,600-->00:1:36,600
Pete Waters's farm, near Chesterton. Pete Waters

8
00:1:36,600-->00:1:38,600
I know it well.

9
00:1:38,600-->00:1:41,600
Pete Waters's lived around here almost as long as I have. Pete Waters

10
00:1:41,600-->00:1:45,600
How long is it going to take for me to get there?

11
00:1:45,600-->00:1:46,600
About fifteen minutes.

12
00:1:46,600-->00:1:48,600
There's a shortcut--if you know it.

13
00:1:48,600-->00:1:50,600
No, I don't.

14
00:1:50,600-->00:1:53,600
Could you tell me how to use the shortcut?

15
00:1:53,600-->00:1:56,600
Sure. You take the next left turn.

16
00:1:56,600-->00:1:58,600
You'll see a stop sign.

17
00:1:58,600-->00:2:0,600
Make a right at the stop sign.

18
00:2:0,600-->00:2:4,600
Stay on that road, and you'll cross a blue bridge.

19
00:2:4,600-->00:2:7,600
Then you'll see a big old red barn.

20
00:2:7,600-->00:2:9,600
That's the back of Pete Waters's place.

21
00:2:9,600-->00:2:14,600
That's quite a difference from the directions that Pete sent me.

22
00:2:14,600-->00:2:19,600
Now, if you take that route, it's probably a lot simpler,

23
00:2:19,600-->00:2:21,600
but it'll take you ten minutes longer.

24
00:2:21,600-->00:2:27,600
OK. Let me repeat it.

25
00:2:27,600-->00:2:31,600
I take the next left turn to the stop sign.

26
00:2:31,600-->00:2:36,600
Then a right across a blue bridge,

27
00:2:36,600-->00:2:39,600
and then a big red barn.

28
00:2:39,600-->00:2:41,600
Can't miss it.

29
00:2:41,600-->00:2:45,600
How much do I owe you?

30
00:2:45,600-->00:2:49,600
Well, that'll be eighteen dollars and seventy cents.

31
00:2:49,600-->00:2:52,600
No charge for the cleanup.

32
00:2:52,600-->00:2:53,600
It's on the house.

33
00:2:53,600-->00:2:56,600
Well, here's a twenty.

34
00:2:56,600-->00:3:5,600
Ah. OK. That's a dollar and thirty cents change.

35
00:3:5,600-->00:3:9,600
There we go ... will make twenty. Thanks.

36
00:3:9,600-->00:3:11,600
Thank you.

37
00:3:11,600-->00:3:13,600
And thanks for the directions.

38
00:3:13,600-->00:3:51,600

39
00:3:51,600-->00:3:54,600
This must be Pete's barn.

40
00:3:54,600-->00:3:56,600
Turn right to the house.

41
00:3:56,600-->00:4:7,600

42
00:4:7,600-->00:4:8,600
Hi.

43
00:4:8,600-->00:4:9,600
Hi. What can I do for you?

44
00:4:9,600-->00:4:11,600
Is this the Pete Waters farm?

45
00:4:11,600-->00:4:12,600
It is.

46
00:4:12,600-->00:4:14,600
I'm a friend of Pete's.

47
00:4:14,600-->00:4:15,600
I'm looking for the house.

48
00:4:15,600-->00:4:16,600
It's just over yonder.

49
00:4:16,600-->00:4:17,600
Keep along this road

50
00:4:17,600-->00:4:18,600
till you get to the end of the fence.

51
00:4:18,600-->00:4:19,600
You'll see the chicken house.

52
00:4:19,600-->00:4:21,600
His house is on the left.

53
00:4:21,600-->00:4:22,600
Well, thanks.

54
00:4:22,600-->00:4:53,600

55
00:4:53,600-->00:4:56,600
"Have gone to the railroad station.

56
00:4:56,600-->00:4:58,600
Back soon with a surprise.

57
00:4:58,600-->00:5:0,600
Make yourself at home.

58
00:5:0,600-->00:5:2,600
Have a look around. Pete."

59
00:5:2,600-->00:5:7,600
Same old Pete Waters. Pete Waters

60
00:5:7,600-->00:5:9,600
Always full of surprises.
