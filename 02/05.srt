How about a California chablis?

20
00:1:45,600-->00:1:46,600
Chablis is fine.

46
00:2:52,600-->00:2:54,600
I do some work for Smith and Dale,

47
00:2:54,600-->00:2:55,600
Your company's accounting firm.

49
00:2:57,600-->00:3:0,600
Here we are.

50
00:3:0,600-->00:3:1,600
Yes.

51
00:3:1,600-->00:3:3,600
I have a daughter.

52
00:3:3,600-->00:3:5,600
I know. How old is she?

53
00:3:5,600-->00:3:7,600
She's nine years old.

54
00:3:7,600-->00:3:9,600
That's a nice age. What's her name?

55
00:3:9,600-->00:3:10,600
Michelle. Michelle

56
00:3:10,600-->00:3:13,600
Do you have a picture of her?

00:3:26,600-->00:3:35,600
Rose-petal salad.

60
00:3:35,600-->00:3:39,600
And there's a phone call for you, Mr. Bennett. Bennett

61
00:3:39,600-->00:3:40,600
Excuse me, Susan.

62
00:3:40,600-->00:3:44,600
I hope nothing is wrong.

63
00:3:44,600-->00:3:46,600
I'll get the rest of the dinner.

64
00:3:46,600-->00:3:47,600
Excuse me.

65
00:3:47,600-->00:4:2,600
Please forgive me, Susan, but...

66
00:4:2,600-->00:4:5,600
I have to leave. I feel terrible, but...

67
00:4:5,600-->00:4:7,600
What's the matter?

68
00:4:7,600-->00:4:10,600
My daughter isn't feeling well.

69
00:4:10,600-->00:4:12,600
Oh no! Is it serious?

70
00:4:12,600-->00:4:16,600
I don't know. The baby-sitter says she has a stomachache,

71
00:4:16,600-->00:4:17,600
and she's crying.

72
00:4:17,600-->00:4:18,600
I'll have to go home.

73
00:4:18,600-->00:4:19,600
Will you forgive me?

74
00:4:19,600-->00:4:22,600
Of course. I'm so sorry for Michelle.

75
00:4:22,600-->00:4:25,600
And you didn't have a chance to eat.

76
00:4:25,600-->00:4:26,600
Oh, it's OK.

77
00:4:26,600-->00:4:27,600
Let me take you home first.

78
00:4:27,600-->00:4:29,600
No, no. Please, go ahead.

79
00:4:29,600-->00:4:31,600
It's our first date.

80
00:4:31,600-->00:4:33,600
We'll make another.

81
00:4:33,600-->00:4:34,600
Please don't worry.

82
00:4:34,600-->00:4:37,600
I'll phone you.

83
00:4:37,600-->00:4:41,600
I hope your daughter is all right. Good-bye.

84
00:4:41,600-->00:4:43,600
Good-bye.
