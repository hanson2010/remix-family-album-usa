1
00:0:50,600-->00:0:54,600
How do you do?

2
00:0:54,600-->00:0:55,600
Hello.

3
00:0:55,600-->00:0:57,600
I'm Ralph Riley.

4
00:0:57,600-->00:1:0,600
I'm Richard Stewart, and this is my wife, Marilyn.

5
00:1:0,600-->00:1:1,600
Pleased to meet you.

6
00:1:1,600-->00:1:2,600
Likewise, Mr. Riley.

7
00:1:2,600-->00:1:6,600
Please, sit down. What can I do for you?

8
00:1:6,600-->00:1:8,600
We'd like to discuss a mortgage.

9
00:1:8,600-->00:1:10,600
For a house.

10
00:1:10,600-->00:1:12,600
Fine. Are you buying a house

11
00:1:12,600-->00:1:14,600
or are you refinancing your present home?

12
00:1:14,600-->00:1:15,600
We're planning to buy a house.

13
00:1:15,600-->00:1:18,600
And we'd like to find out about a mortgage.

14
00:1:18,600-->00:1:20,600
We are customers of the bank.

15
00:1:20,600-->00:1:23,600
As a matter of fact, my whole family banks here.

16
00:1:23,600-->00:1:25,600
I have some questions to ask.

17
00:1:25,600-->00:1:28,600
Do you own your house or do you rent?

18
00:1:28,600-->00:1:30,600
Neither.

19
00:1:30,600-->00:1:33,600
We live with my parents, Dr. and Mrs. Philip Stewart.

20
00:1:33,600-->00:1:37,600
And how old are you?

21
00:1:37,600-->00:1:38,600
I'm twenty-nine.

22
00:1:38,600-->00:1:39,600
I'm thirty.

23
00:1:39,600-->00:1:43,600
And, Mr. Stewart, what is your occupation?

24
00:1:43,600-->00:1:45,600
I'm a freelance photographer.

25
00:1:45,600-->00:1:47,600
And, Mrs. Stewart, are you working?

26
00:1:47,600-->00:1:50,600
Yes. I'm a designer, and I work in a boutique.

27
00:1:50,600-->00:1:53,600
Did you bring any savings or salary information?

28
00:1:53,600-->00:1:55,600
Last year's tax forms?

29
00:1:55,600-->00:1:57,600
Yes. Here they are.

30
00:1:57,600-->00:2:5,600
OK. What ... what kind of house did you have in mind?

31
00:2:5,600-->00:2:6,600
We're talking about buying

32
00:2:6,600-->00:2:8,600
a two-bedroom house in Mount Kisco.

33
00:2:8,600-->00:2:11,600
Here are the financial details on the house.

34
00:2:11,600-->00:2:12,600
Thank you.

35
00:2:12,600-->00:2:17,600
Are you prepared to make a ten-percent down payment?

36
00:2:17,600-->00:2:18,600
Yes, we are.

37
00:2:18,600-->00:2:21,600
Payments over thirty years?

38
00:2:21,600-->00:2:22,600
Yes.

39
00:2:22,600-->00:2:26,600
Do you think we can get a loan?

40
00:2:26,600-->00:2:32,600
Well, it depends. Do you own any other property?

41
00:2:32,600-->00:2:33,600
Any stocks or bonds?

42
00:2:33,600-->00:2:36,600
No.

43
00:2:36,600-->00:2:40,600
I see. Then you don't have any collateral.

44
00:2:40,600-->00:2:43,600
Perhaps you could get a guarantor--

45
00:2:43,600-->00:2:46,600
someone to sign for the loan for you.

46
00:2:46,600-->00:2:48,600
Why is that necessary?

47
00:2:48,600-->00:2:50,600
Since you don't have enough income,

48
00:2:50,600-->00:2:52,600
and you don't already own any property,

49
00:2:52,600-->00:2:54,600
the bank needs to be sure

50
00:2:54,600-->00:2:55,600
you can pay the mortgage every month.

51
00:2:55,600-->00:2:58,600
A guarantor is responsible for the loan

52
00:2:58,600-->00:2:59,600
if you can't make the payments.

53
00:2:59,600-->00:3:6,600
I see. Well, the idea of buying a house is exciting.

54
00:3:6,600-->00:3:9,600
Thank you, Mr. Riley. We'll read this over carefully.

55
00:3:9,600-->00:3:11,600
Thank you.

56
00:3:11,600-->00:3:13,600
Good-bye. Thanks.

57
00:3:13,600-->00:3:15,600
Good-bye. And hope to see you soon.

58
00:3:15,600-->00:3:17,600
I hope so, too.

59
00:3:17,600-->00:3:19,600
Take care.

60
00:3:19,600-->00:3:20,600
Good-bye.

61
00:3:20,600-->00:3:39,200
It all sounded so easy

62
00:3:39,200-->00:3:42,600
until they mentioned needing collateral or a guarantor.

63
00:3:42,600-->00:3:45,600
We have no collateral.

64
00:3:45,600-->00:3:48,600
And I don't think it's a good idea

65
00:3:48,600-->00:3:50,600
to ask Dad to sign as a guarantor.

66
00:3:50,600-->00:3:52,600
I don't feel right about it.

67
00:3:52,600-->00:3:54,600
I understand your feelings about it, Richard.

68
00:3:54,600-->00:4:11,600
Now, tell me, what's the problem?

69
00:4:11,600-->00:4:14,600
We can get a loan from the bank

70
00:4:14,600-->00:4:16,600
if we can put up some collateral.

71
00:4:16,600-->00:4:19,600
And we don't own anything to use as collateral.

72
00:4:19,600-->00:4:23,600
Or someone can sign with us as a guarantor.

73
00:4:23,600-->00:4:27,600
Why don't you speak to Dad?

74
00:4:27,600-->00:4:31,600
No. If we buy a house, I want to be able to handle it alone.

75
00:4:31,600-->00:4:35,600
Everybody needs help sometimes, Richard.

76
00:4:35,600-->00:4:38,600
I understand Richard's feelings about it, Ellen.

77
00:4:38,600-->00:4:41,600
In two or three months, I'll have an advance on my book

78
00:4:41,600-->00:4:42,600
and be able to put more money down.

79
00:4:42,600-->00:4:45,600
What about the house in Mount Kisco?

80
00:4:45,600-->00:4:49,600
Somebody else'll buy it by then.

81
00:4:49,600-->00:4:51,600
Then there'll be other houses, Marilyn.

82
00:4:51,600-->00:4:55,600
Richard has a point. You're just beginning to look. Richard

83
00:4:55,600-->00:4:57,600
We're in no great rush. It's true.

84
00:4:57,600-->00:5:0,600
This has been a great learning experience for us, Marilyn.

85
00:5:0,600-->00:5:2,600
Talking to the real-estate agent.

86
00:5:2,600-->00:5:3,600
Looking at the houses.

87
00:5:3,600-->00:5:6,600
Talking to the loan officer at the bank.

88
00:5:6,600-->00:5:9,600
It has been a learning experience. That's true.

89
00:5:9,600-->00:5:13,600
I think you're doing the right thing. Taking your time.

90
00:5:13,600-->00:5:17,600
Looking around. Especially with a purchase of this kind.

91
00:5:17,600-->00:5:19,600
You're talking about a lot of money.

92
00:5:19,600-->00:5:23,600
We'll call Mrs. Martinelli and tell her to keep looking for us.

93
00:5:23,600-->00:5:25,600
And I'll call Mr. Riley at the bank

94
00:5:25,600-->00:5:28,600
and tell him we'll see him in a couple of months.

95
00:5:28,600-->00:5:31,600
And if you ever need Dad or me to help you ...

96
00:5:31,600-->00:5:32,600
We know.

97
00:5:32,600-->00:5:35,600
You know we'll be there for you.

98
00:5:35,600-->00:5:39,600
It's a Stewart tradition. We're a family.
