00:2:15,600-->00:2:18,600
Marilyn, you want coffee or tea? Marilyn

2
00:2:18,600-->00:2:19,600
Coffee, please.

3
00:2:19,600-->00:2:34,600
I am so excited!

4
00:2:34,600-->00:2:37,600
At this time tomorrow morning,

5
00:2:37,600-->00:2:43,600
Grandpa will be sitting in the kitchen with us.

6
00:2:43,600-->00:2:46,600
When does he arrive?

7
00:2:46,600-->00:2:48,600
At six o'clock this evening.

8
00:2:48,600-->00:2:50,600
By plane?

9
00:2:50,600-->00:2:52,600
No, by train.

10
00:2:52,600-->00:2:57,600
Are we picking him up at the station?

11
00:2:57,600-->00:2:58,600
Not Grandpa.

12
00:2:58,600-->00:3:1,600
He doesn't want anybody picking him up.

13
00:3:1,600-->00:3:3,600
He likes to be independent.

14
00:3:3,600-->00:3:8,600
Oh, let's go upstairs and prepare Grandpa's room.

15
00:3:8,600-->00:3:10,600
Great! Let's do it!

16
00:3:10,600-->00:3:11,600
Good morning, Mom.

17
00:3:11,600-->00:3:12,600
Morning.

18
00:3:12,600-->00:3:13,600
Well, hi, fellas.

19
00:3:13,600-->00:3:14,000
Hello.

20
00:3:14,000-->00:3:14,600
Hi, honey.

21
00:3:14,600-->00:3:15,600
Morning, Marilyn.

22
00:3:15,600-->00:3:17,600
We are going upstairs to set up Grandpa's room.

23
00:3:17,600-->00:3:19,600
There's coffee ready.

24
00:3:19,600-->00:3:24,600
I'm really excited about seeing Grandpa.

25
00:3:24,600-->00:3:27,600
Me, too. Milk, please.

26
00:3:27,600-->00:3:29,600
He's so funny.

27
00:3:29,600-->00:3:30,600
He always makes me laugh.

28
00:3:30,600-->00:3:35,600
I hope Grandpa's going to like living with us.

29
00:3:35,600-->00:3:36,600
I think he will.

30
00:3:36,600-->00:3:39,600
It just takes time to feel comfortable in a new place.

31
00:3:39,600-->00:3:41,600
Won't he miss being in Florida?

32
00:3:41,600-->00:3:42,600
Well, he will.

33
00:3:42,600-->00:3:44,600
But I think he'll like being here with the family.

34
00:3:44,600-->00:3:45,600
Are you sure about that?

35
00:3:45,600-->00:3:47,600
It's crazy here most of the time.

36
00:3:47,600-->00:3:48,600
But it's fun.

37
00:3:48,600-->00:3:49,600
That's for sure.

38
00:3:49,600-->00:3:51,600
You know,

39
00:3:51,600-->00:3:53,600
maybe I'll put together some photos of Grandpa

40
00:3:53,600-->00:3:54,600
as a "welcome" present.

41
00:3:54,600-->00:3:56,600
That's a neat idea.

42
00:3:56,600-->00:3:58,600
What can I do?

43
00:3:58,600-->00:3:59,600
I've got it!

44
00:3:59,600-->00:4:3,600
I have a picture of Grandpa and Dad and me in my wallet.

45
00:4:3,600-->00:4:6,600
It's from the Fathers and Sons' Breakfast

46
00:4:6,600-->00:4:8,600
at my junior high school graduation.

47
00:4:8,600-->00:4:11,600
Oh, I remember this picture.

48
00:4:11,600-->00:4:15,600
I'd really like to pick up Grandpa at the railroad station.

49
00:4:15,600-->00:4:19,600
Railroad stations or airports--

50
00:4:19,600-->00:4:20,600
Grandpa always tells us he'll get here by himself.

51
00:4:20,600-->00:4:22,600
He's something!

52
00:4:22,600-->00:4:29,600
Is this all Grandpa's stuff?

53
00:4:29,600-->00:4:30,600
That's it.

54
00:4:30,600-->00:4:34,600
But I'm sure he has a few bags with him on the train.

55
00:4:34,600-->00:4:37,600
What's inside?

56
00:4:37,600-->00:4:42,600
I don't know. It's locked.

57
00:4:42,600-->00:4:44,600
Hi.

58
00:4:44,600-->00:4:48,600
Oh, hi, darling.

59
00:4:48,600-->00:4:49,600
Morning, Philip.

60
00:4:49,600-->00:4:52,600
I want to put some of my good hangers in Grandpa's closet.

61
00:4:52,600-->00:4:55,600
You know I'm very excited about his arrival.

62
00:4:55,600-->00:4:57,600
We are, too.

63
00:4:57,600-->00:4:59,600
Susan called early this morning. Susan

64
00:4:59,600-->00:5:1,600
She's unhappy

65
00:5:1,600-->00:5:4,600
because she's had to go to Chicago on a business trip

66
00:5:4,600-->00:5:5,600
and can't leave till tonight.

67
00:5:5,600-->00:5:7,600
She wants to be here for Grandpa.

68
00:5:7,600-->00:5:10,600
Well, Grandpa will be disappointed, too.

69
00:5:10,600-->00:5:12,600
He loves Susan.

70
00:5:12,600-->00:5:14,600
She always reminds him of Grandma. Susan

71
00:5:14,600-->00:5:18,600
Well, how's everything here?

72
00:5:18,600-->00:5:23,600
Fine. We were just wondering about this trunk.

73
00:5:23,600-->00:5:26,600
It's locked.

74
00:5:26,600-->00:5:31,600
Oh. I have the key. Grandpa sent it to me.
