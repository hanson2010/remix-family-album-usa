00:0:43,600-->00:0:46,600
Welcome to the Watermill Inn.

2
00:0:46,600-->00:0:48,600
Oh, Richard,

3
00:0:48,600-->00:0:50,600
it's exactly as it was when we were married!

4
00:0:50,600-->00:0:52,600
And when I got married.

5
00:0:52,600-->00:0:55,600
Even the old patchwork quilt is the same!

6
00:0:55,600-->00:0:58,600
My great-grandmother made that quilt

7
00:0:58,600-->00:1:0,600
when Teddy Roosevelt was President.

8
00:1:0,600-->00:1:3,600
In those days, when they made quilts.

9
00:1:3,600-->00:1:4,600
they cut patches

10
00:1:4,600-->00:1:7,600
from the old clothing of every member in the family

11
00:1:7,600-->00:1:10,600
so that each one would be a part of it.

12
00:1:10,600-->00:1:11,600
What a lovely tradition!

13
00:1:11,600-->00:1:13,600
Thank you for calling us.

14
00:1:13,600-->00:1:15,600
I remember you and your wife

15
00:1:15,600-->00:1:17,600
from the first time you stayed with us.

16
00:1:17,600-->00:1:19,600
We were very young.

17
00:1:19,600-->00:1:21,600
And very much in love.

18
00:1:21,600-->00:1:23,600
We have a baby now.

19
00:1:23,600-->00:1:27,600
How wonderful! A boy or a girl?

20
00:1:27,600-->00:1:29,600
A boy - Max.

21
00:1:29,600-->00:1:30,600
Do you have a picture?

22
00:1:30,600-->00:1:34,600
Would a professional photographer be without a picture?

23
00:1:34,600-->00:1:40,600
Oh, he's adorable!

24
00:1:40,600-->00:1:41,600
And very bright.

25
00:1:41,600-->00:1:43,600
Like his father. A real Stewart.

26
00:1:43,600-->00:1:45,600
And very good-looking, like his mother.

27
00:1:45,600-->00:1:48,600
Well, it's nice to have you with us again.

28
00:1:48,600-->00:1:50,600
Next time, bring the baby.

29
00:1:50,600-->00:1:53,600
You see, Richard? Max is welcome here.

30
00:1:53,600-->00:1:54,600
Not on our anniversary.

31
00:1:54,600-->00:1:56,600
This vacation is for you and me.

32
00:1:56,600-->00:2:0,600
If there's anything you need, please call me.

33
00:2:0,600-->00:2:1,600
I'll be in the front office all day.

34
00:2:1,600-->00:2:8,600
Oh, I took the liberty of ordering some breakfast for you.

35
00:2:8,600-->00:2:14,600
Just put it over there, Charles.

36
00:2:14,600-->00:2:30,600

37
00:2:30,600-->00:2:32,600
Thank you, Charles.

38
00:2:32,600-->00:2:37,600
Compliments of the Watermill Inn. Watermill Inn

39
00:2:37,600-->00:2:38,600
Thank you.

40
00:2:38,600-->00:2:39,600
Thank you so much.

41
00:2:39,600-->00:2:46,600
Now, this is my idea of a good time.

42
00:2:46,600-->00:2:54,600
Let's see ... hotcakes and maple syrup, with scrambled eggs.

43
00:2:54,600-->00:2:58,600
Umm... smell that coffee... cinnamon and cloves.

44
00:2:58,600-->00:3:0,600
Homemade buttermilk biscuits.

45
00:3:0,600-->00:3:3,600
Slices of orange with burnt honey.

46
00:3:3,600-->00:3:5,600
Let's eat!

47
00:3:5,600-->00:3:6,600
First I want to call home

48
00:3:6,600-->00:3:8,600
and check on your mother and the baby.

49
00:3:8,600-->00:3:10,600
Honey, if there were any problems,

50
00:3:10,600-->00:3:11,600
she would call us.

51
00:3:11,600-->00:3:13,600
She doesn't know we've changed hotels.

52
00:3:13,600-->00:3:15,600
You're right. Of course.

53
00:3:15,600-->00:3:25,600
Hello, operator.

54
00:3:25,600-->00:3:28,600
I'd like to call Riverdale, New York.

55
00:3:28,600-->00:3:36,600
This food is heavenly, isn't it?

56
00:3:36,600-->00:3:39,600
This whole place is heavenly.

57
00:3:39,600-->00:3:51,600
Do you remember that old desk?

58
00:3:51,600-->00:3:56,600
Mrs. Montefiore told me that Montefiore

59
00:3:56,600-->00:3:58,600
George Washington sat at that desk

60
00:3:58,600-->00:3:59,600
and wrote to his wife Martha.

61
00:3:59,600-->00:4:1,600
What do you want to do after breakfast?

62
00:4:1,600-->00:4:4,600
Why don't we take a walk down to the river?

63
00:4:4,600-->00:4:5,600
In the rain?

64
00:4:5,600-->00:4:10,600
No. Look out the window. The sun is shining!

65
00:4:10,600-->00:4:18,600
Now this is my idea of a good time!
