1
00:0:50,600-->00:0:54,600
This is really neat!

2
00:0:54,600-->00:0:57,600
When do we eat?

3
00:0:57,600-->00:1:0,600
First, we have to catch some fish.

4
00:1:0,600-->00:1:6,600
In order to catch fish, you have to do this.

5
00:1:6,600-->00:1:9,600
Here we go.

6
00:1:9,600-->00:1:11,600
That's it.

7
00:1:11,600-->00:1:18,600
Then drop it into the water.

8
00:1:18,600-->00:1:22,600
All of this comes before eating. OK?

9
00:1:22,600-->00:1:25,600
How do you know so much about fishing?

10
00:1:25,600-->00:1:26,600
Grandpa taught me.

11
00:1:26,600-->00:1:28,600
We spent a lot of time fishing together.

12
00:1:28,600-->00:1:39,600
Now, the important thing is to get the hook close to the fish.

13
00:1:39,600-->00:1:40,600
All right?

14
00:1:40,600-->00:1:41,600
Like this.

15
00:1:41,600-->00:1:51,600
I think I see some fish right under us, Dad.

16
00:1:51,600-->00:1:52,600
Oh, not a chance!

17
00:1:52,600-->00:1:55,600
I just saw a big one!

18
00:1:55,600-->00:1:57,600
Hi, there!

19
00:1:57,600-->00:1:58,600
Hi.

20
00:1:58,600-->00:1:59,600
What's your name?

21
00:1:59,600-->00:2:0,600
Albert.

22
00:2:0,600-->00:2:1,600
Are you all alone?

23
00:2:1,600-->00:2:2,600
Yes, sir.

24
00:2:2,600-->00:2:5,600
How old are you, Albert?

25
00:2:5,600-->00:2:6,600
I'm ten.

26
00:2:6,600-->00:2:9,600
Where's your father?

27
00:2:9,600-->00:2:11,600
He's up there at the lodge.

28
00:2:11,600-->00:2:16,600
Does he know you're here?

29
00:2:16,600-->00:2:17,600
Yes, sir.

30
00:2:17,600-->00:2:21,600
OK, Robbie, maybe you should watch him.

31
00:2:21,600-->00:2:23,600
The water's pretty deep here.

32
00:2:23,600-->00:2:24,600
I'll watch him, Dad.

33
00:2:24,600-->00:2:33,600
What time is it?

34
00:2:33,600-->00:2:37,600
It's almost lunchtime, and no fish yet.

35
00:2:37,600-->00:2:40,600
I can go up to the lodge for some hot dogs and drinks.

36
00:2:40,600-->00:2:41,600
No way!

37
00:2:41,600-->00:2:43,600
We're here to catch our lunch.

38
00:2:43,600-->00:2:47,600
To catch fish, you need the right magic.

39
00:2:47,600-->00:2:48,600
That's right.

40
00:2:48,600-->00:2:49,600
I forgot!

41
00:2:49,600-->00:2:51,600
The right magic.

42
00:2:51,600-->00:2:52,600
Do it for Robbie, Dad.

43
00:2:52,600-->00:2:53,600
You remember?

44
00:2:53,600-->00:2:54,600
Sure. Come on.

45
00:2:54,600-->00:2:59,600
Well, first, you have to turn your hat around like this.

46
00:2:59,600-->00:3:4,600
Then you close your eyes and say the magic words.

47
00:3:4,600-->00:3:9,600
Fish, fish, send me a fish.

48
00:3:9,600-->00:3:20,600
Fish, fish, send me a fish... I got one!

49
00:3:20,600-->00:3:21,600
See, it works!

50
00:3:21,600-->00:3:23,600
It's a big one!

51
00:3:23,600-->00:3:25,600
Well, it always worked for me, too.

52
00:3:25,600-->00:3:28,600
Grandpa, get the net, please!

53
00:3:28,600-->00:3:38,600
Dad, you got one, too!

54
00:3:38,600-->00:3:39,600
You bet I have!

55
00:3:39,600-->00:3:41,600
Easy, Philip, easy.

56
00:3:41,600-->00:3:47,600
Sorry, Dad.

57
00:3:47,600-->00:3:52,600
Well, one more and I've got a pair of boots.

58
00:3:52,600-->00:3:56,600
You didn't say the magic words.

59
00:3:56,600-->00:3:58,600
Robbie's right.

60
00:3:58,600-->00:4:0,600
Yes, but you did, and we've got our lunch.

61
00:4:0,600-->00:4:2,600
Let's build a fire and cook it!

62
00:4:2,600-->00:4:3,600
Come on, Albert, you can help us!

63
00:4:3,600-->00:4:5,600
I want to stay here and fish.

64
00:4:5,600-->00:4:9,600
All right, but be careful.

65
00:4:9,600-->00:4:20,600
Is it finished yet?

66
00:4:20,600-->00:4:21,600
I think so.

67
00:4:21,600-->00:4:24,600
I hope you like your fish well done.

68
00:4:24,600-->00:4:27,600
Burned, you mean.

69
00:4:27,600-->00:4:30,600
Hey, I'm a doctor, not a chef.

70
00:4:30,600-->00:4:43,600
Help! Help! I can't swim!

71
00:4:43,600-->00:4:45,600
Dad! Grandpa! He fell in!

72
00:4:45,600-->00:5:6,600
Easy does it, Robbie.

73
00:5:6,600-->00:5:7,600
That a boy.

74
00:5:7,600-->00:5:8,600
That's it.

75
00:5:8,600-->00:5:9,600
He's not breathing, Philip!

76
00:5:9,600-->00:5:10,600
Robbie, run to the car!

77
00:5:10,600-->00:5:11,600
Bring a blanket and my medical bag.

78
00:5:11,600-->00:5:12,600
Yes, Dad.

79
00:5:12,600-->00:5:16,600
Now, come on, son. Come on, son.

80
00:5:16,600-->00:5:20,600
Breathe, Albert!
