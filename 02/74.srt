00:1:3,600-->00:1:6,600
Oh, I love it!

2
00:1:6,600-->00:1:8,600
I love it!

3
00:1:8,600-->00:1:11,600
To be away from the city on such a beautiful day

4
00:1:11,600-->00:1:14,600
is my idea of heaven!

5
00:1:14,600-->00:1:19,600
The grass. The trees. The fresh air.

6
00:1:19,600-->00:1:22,600
I told you you'd like it. I've been doing this for years.

7
00:1:22,600-->00:1:25,600
You have the spirit of a teenager, Susan.

8
00:1:25,600-->00:1:29,600
Wait till you see yourself jumping around.

9
00:1:29,600-->00:1:32,600
That's what I love about Susan.

10
00:1:32,600-->00:1:33,600
She works hard.

11
00:1:33,600-->00:1:34,600
She plays hard.

12
00:1:34,600-->00:1:35,600
She's a real Stewart.

13
00:1:35,600-->00:1:36,600
Come on, Richard.

14
00:1:36,600-->00:1:38,600
Help me get this stuff out of the car.

15
00:1:38,600-->00:1:41,600
Where does it go?

16
00:1:41,600-->00:1:44,600
Well, we'll put everything over there.

17
00:1:44,600-->00:1:47,600
We'll set up our tents over there by the edge of the woods.

18
00:1:47,600-->00:1:49,600
Then we'll be able to make our fire there where it's safe.

19
00:1:49,600-->00:1:51,600
Oh, there's our table and benches.

20
00:1:51,600-->00:1:52,600
All set for eating.

21
00:1:52,600-->00:1:54,600
That's what makes this spot so good.

22
00:1:54,600-->00:2:2,600
Is anybody hungry?

23
00:2:2,600-->00:2:3,600
I am.

24
00:2:3,600-->00:2:4,600
We just got here.

25
00:2:4,600-->00:2:8,600
When you're out in the fresh air like this, it makes you hungry.

26
00:2:8,600-->00:2:9,600
Aren't you hungry, Marilyn?

27
00:2:9,600-->00:2:10,600
I sure am.

28
00:2:10,600-->00:2:11,600
How about you, Richard?

29
00:2:11,600-->00:2:12,600
Starving.

30
00:2:12,600-->00:2:14,600
You guys are like three kids.

31
00:2:14,600-->00:2:15,600
Aren't you hungry, Harry?

32
00:2:15,600-->00:2:17,600
Well, yeah.

33
00:2:17,600-->00:2:19,600
Now that you mention it, I guess I am.

34
00:2:19,600-->00:2:20,600
I mean,

35
00:2:20,600-->00:2:22,600
how could a guy not be hungry with all this talk about eating?

36
00:2:22,600-->00:2:24,600
Where's the bag with the chicken salad sandwiches?

37
00:2:24,600-->00:2:27,600
Right here, next to the ice packs. Here.

38
00:2:27,600-->00:2:30,600
Put the tablecloth on the picnic table,

39
00:2:30,600-->00:2:35,600
and I will bring the cola and the plastic cups.

40
00:2:35,600-->00:2:38,600
Well, how do you like it so far?

41
00:2:38,600-->00:2:40,600
I've never been more relaxed.

42
00:2:40,600-->00:2:41,600
Me, neither.

43
00:2:41,600-->00:2:45,600
I wish we had brought Michelle, Harry.

44
00:2:45,600-->00:2:46,600
She would have loved it.

45
00:2:46,600-->00:2:48,600
Oh, you're right.

46
00:2:48,600-->00:2:50,600
I wish we had brought Max.

47
00:2:50,600-->00:2:56,600
Marilyn, Susan, let's not begin to worry about Michelle and Max. Marilyn Susan

48
00:2:56,600-->00:2:59,600
We're having a good time, and they're in good hands.

49
00:2:59,600-->00:3:0,600
Richard is right. Richard

50
00:3:0,600-->00:3:2,600
Are you having a good time, Susan?

51
00:3:2,600-->00:3:3,600
You haven't answered my question.

52
00:3:3,600-->00:3:6,600
I am having a good time, Harry.

53
00:3:6,600-->00:3:9,600
I promise not to think about the city.

54
00:3:9,600-->00:3:10,600
We're in the country.

55
00:3:10,600-->00:3:13,600
Let's all just enjoy this wonderful place

56
00:3:13,600-->00:3:14,600
and this wonderful weather.

57
00:3:14,600-->00:3:15,600
Good.

58
00:3:15,600-->00:3:35,600

59
00:3:35,600-->00:3:38,600
This is heaven, Harry!

60
00:3:38,600-->00:3:43,600
It was such a great idea to spend the weekend this way.

61
00:3:43,600-->00:3:45,600
Thanks, Susan.

62
00:3:45,600-->00:3:47,600
I thought you'd all like it.

63
00:3:47,600-->00:3:48,600
Like it?

64
00:3:48,600-->00:3:53,600
Listen to the sounds of the summer that surround us.

65
00:3:53,600-->00:3:55,600
It's so calming.

66
00:3:55,600-->00:4:2,600
I've always liked camping out.

67
00:4:2,600-->00:4:4,600
Away from the telephones and account books.

68
00:4:4,600-->00:4:7,600
It's refreshing for me.

69
00:4:7,600-->00:4:10,600
I always go back to the city in a wonderful state of mind.

70
00:4:10,600-->00:4:14,600
We've only been here for a day,

71
00:4:14,600-->00:4:17,600
and I've completely forgotten about all my business problems.

72
00:4:17,600-->00:4:21,600
The office seems so far away.

73
00:4:21,600-->00:4:23,600
I'm glad you like it, Susan.

74
00:4:23,600-->00:4:25,600
We'll spend many more weekends like this.

75
00:4:25,600-->00:4:28,600
And next time we'll bring Michelle.

76
00:4:28,600-->00:4:33,600
I wish she were here with us to enjoy the country.

77
00:4:33,600-->00:4:36,600
And next time we'll bring Michelle.

78
00:4:36,600-->00:4:41,600
Just listen to the sound.

79
00:4:41,600-->00:4:45,600
It's so soothing.

80
00:4:45,600-->00:4:50,600
I can hardly keep my eyes open.

81
00:4:50,600-->00:4:56,600
If only we could bottle the fresh air.

82
00:4:56,600-->00:4:59,600
Wouldn't it be wonderful?

83
00:4:59,600-->00:5:3,600
We could call it "Deep Sleep Country Air."

84
00:5:3,600-->00:5:7,600
It puts you to sleep.

85
00:5:7,600-->00:5:10,600
So does the sound.

86
00:5:10,600-->00:5:19,600
I've been having a hard time keeping my eyes open

87
00:5:19,600-->00:5:20,600
just listening to it.

88
00:5:20,600-->00:5:26,600
It's like a special music.

89
00:5:26,600-->00:5:30,600
Too bad we can't bottle the sound.

90
00:5:30,600-->00:5:33,600
But we can!

91
00:5:33,600-->00:5:35,600
Can what?

92
00:5:35,600-->00:5:38,600
Bottle the sound.

93
00:5:38,600-->00:5:40,600
What are you talking about?

94
00:5:40,600-->00:5:43,600
Oh, yeah?

95
00:5:43,600-->00:5:46,600
Great idea!

96
00:5:46,600-->00:5:48,600
Let's do it!
