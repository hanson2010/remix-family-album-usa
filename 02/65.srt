1
00:0:49,600-->00:0:53,600
There's your teddy bear, Max.

2
00:0:53,600-->00:0:58,600
He just loves that teddy bear

3
00:0:58,600-->00:0:59,600
that Grandpa Philip bought for him.

4
00:0:59,600-->00:1:5,600
I took him to Philip's office yesterday for a checkup.

5
00:1:5,600-->00:1:9,600
You should have seen the look on his face

6
00:1:9,600-->00:1:12,600
when Molly gave him the injection. Molly

7
00:1:12,600-->00:1:13,600
Oh, did he cry?

8
00:1:13,600-->00:1:14,600
No.

9
00:1:14,600-->00:1:19,600
My dear little boy just looked up at me as if to say,

10
00:1:19,600-->00:1:24,600
"Mama, what are they doing to me? Help!"

11
00:1:24,600-->00:1:26,600
How did you feel?

12
00:1:26,600-->00:1:27,600
Tell the truth.

13
00:1:27,600-->00:1:29,600
Didn't you feel terrible?

14
00:1:29,600-->00:1:31,600
I sure did.

15
00:1:31,600-->00:1:34,600
I held him closely.

16
00:1:34,600-->00:1:37,600
I kissed the top of his dear little head.

17
00:1:37,600-->00:1:41,600
He looked up at me.

18
00:1:41,600-->00:1:42,600
He tried to smile.

19
00:1:42,600-->00:1:48,600
Being with him helped.

20
00:1:48,600-->00:1:51,600
Helped him?

21
00:1:51,600-->00:1:52,600
Or helped you?

22
00:1:52,600-->00:1:57,600
Being a mother is not easy,

23
00:1:57,600-->00:1:59,600
if that's what you mean.

24
00:1:59,600-->00:2:3,600
Speaking of being a mother,

25
00:2:3,600-->00:2:6,600
I've been meaning to ask you

26
00:2:6,600-->00:2:9,600
what you were thinking about regarding going back to work.

27
00:2:9,600-->00:2:12,600
I know Rita Mae called.

28
00:2:12,600-->00:2:14,600
I can imagine what is going through your head.

29
00:2:14,600-->00:2:15,600
I'm sure you can, Ellen.

30
00:2:15,600-->00:2:18,600
There are so many things to consider.

31
00:2:18,600-->00:2:21,600
One thing that makes it easier for you

32
00:2:21,600-->00:2:22,600
is that you have us.

33
00:2:22,600-->00:2:28,600
Max will always have a family member to watch over him

34
00:2:28,600-->00:2:29,600
while you're at work.

35
00:2:29,600-->00:2:32,600
I didn't have that when Richard and Susan were born.

36
00:2:32,600-->00:2:34,600
What did you do?

37
00:2:34,600-->00:2:38,600
I chose to continue with my career as a music teacher.

38
00:2:38,600-->00:2:42,600
We hired a woman to watch Richard and then Susan,

39
00:2:42,600-->00:2:46,600
and I continued with my career.

40
00:2:46,600-->00:2:51,600
Do you think you made the right decision?

41
00:2:51,600-->00:2:53,600
I think I did.

42
00:2:53,600-->00:2:56,600
But when Robbie was born,

43
00:2:56,600-->00:2:59,600
I decided to give full-time attention to raising Robbie.

44
00:2:59,600-->00:3:1,600
I felt differently at that time.

45
00:3:1,600-->00:3:3,600
And you gave up your career as a music teacher?

46
00:3:3,600-->00:3:5,600
Not exactly.

47
00:3:5,600-->00:3:8,600
I continued to teach piano lessons at home.

48
00:3:8,600-->00:3:11,600
How did you feel about being away

49
00:3:11,600-->00:3:15,600
when Susan and Richard were babies?

50
00:3:15,600-->00:3:18,600
I think I did the right thing

51
00:3:18,600-->00:3:22,600
for them and for myself and for Philip.

52
00:3:22,600-->00:3:23,600
We needed the money.

53
00:3:23,600-->00:3:25,600
Well, we do too, Ellen.

54
00:3:25,600-->00:3:30,600
Everything I earn helps us towards getting that house

55
00:3:30,600-->00:3:32,600
we want and need.

56
00:3:32,600-->00:3:37,600
I can't wait till he's just a little older.

57
00:3:37,600-->00:3:40,600
Our toy company makes the most wonderful toys for kids.

58
00:3:40,600-->00:3:43,600
Max thanks you. Max

59
00:3:43,600-->00:3:44,600
I thank you.

60
00:3:44,600-->00:3:45,600
And Richard thanks you. Richard

61
00:3:45,600-->00:3:47,600
Now may I please say hello?

62
00:3:47,600-->00:3:49,600
Hello.

63
00:3:49,600-->00:3:51,600
Hello.

64
00:3:51,600-->00:3:55,600
I miss Max and think about him all week long.

65
00:3:55,600-->00:3:58,600
We talk about him at dinnertime.

66
00:3:58,600-->00:3:59,600
Will you please try to relax?

67
00:3:59,600-->00:4:1,600
I've never seen you so wound up.

68
00:4:1,600-->00:4:5,600
You seem to be enjoying the pressure.

69
00:4:5,600-->00:4:7,600
The truth is, I am.

70
00:4:7,600-->00:4:9,600
My job is not an easy one,

71
00:4:9,600-->00:4:10,600
but I really enjoy it.

72
00:4:10,600-->00:4:15,600
That is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, Susan.

73
00:4:15,600-->00:4:17,600
What's the problem?

74
00:4:17,600-->00:4:19,600
Marilyn's career. Marilyn

75
00:4:19,600-->00:4:22,600
Well, my choice of careers.

76
00:4:22,600-->00:4:23,600
Choice?

77
00:4:23,600-->00:4:28,600
My career as a fashion designer

78
00:4:28,600-->00:4:30,600
versus my career as a mother.

79
00:4:30,600-->00:4:33,600
Why does it have to be one or the other?

80
00:4:33,600-->00:4:35,600
That's what I said.

81
00:4:35,600-->00:4:36,600
How's that?

82
00:4:36,600-->00:4:38,600
Why can't you do both?

83
00:4:38,600-->00:4:40,600
She's right.

84
00:4:40,600-->00:4:42,600
Both?

85
00:4:42,600-->00:4:44,600
Well, that's what I do.

86
00:4:44,600-->00:4:47,600
I have a job, and I have Michelle.

87
00:4:47,600-->00:4:49,600
I take care of both to the best of my ability.

88
00:4:49,600-->00:4:52,600
It's not easy, but what is?

89
00:4:52,600-->00:4:54,600
And that's what I did.

90
00:4:54,600-->00:4:57,600
I did both with Richard and Susan,

91
00:4:57,600-->00:4:58,600
and I did both with Robbie.

92
00:4:58,600-->00:5:0,600
I thought you stayed home with Robbie?

93
00:5:0,600-->00:5:1,600
I did.

94
00:5:1,600-->00:5:4,600
But I was lucky enough to have a career as a music teacher

95
00:5:4,600-->00:5:6,600
which I could continue at home.

96
00:5:6,600-->00:5:11,600
Why can't you work at home, Marilyn?

97
00:5:11,600-->00:5:13,600
You're very talented.

98
00:5:13,600-->00:5:16,600
Designing dresses is a career

99
00:5:16,600-->00:5:18,600
you could establish out of your home,

100
00:5:18,600-->00:5:19,600
couldn't you?

101
00:5:19,600-->00:5:25,600
I don't know why I didn't think of it.

102
00:5:25,600-->00:5:29,600
It seems so simple now.

103
00:5:29,600-->00:5:32,600
For a year or two

104
00:5:32,600-->00:5:36,600
I could stay at home with Max and do my dress designs.

105
00:5:36,600-->00:5:40,600
And you could make your dresses at home.

106
00:5:40,600-->00:5:44,600
Sounds like a great way to solve the problem.

107
00:5:44,600-->00:5:47,600
That could solve your problem, Marilyn.

108
00:5:47,600-->00:5:50,600
I'm going to call Rita Mae at home

109
00:5:50,600-->00:5:52,600
and ask her to come by and talk about it.

110
00:5:52,600-->00:5:55,600
She wants to see Max, anyway.

111
00:5:55,600-->00:5:58,600
I think that really answers your questions, Marilyn.

112
00:5:58,600-->00:5:59,600
You can do it.

113
00:5:59,600-->00:6:1,600
Do your designs at home--here.

114
00:6:1,600-->00:6:4,600
And let Rita Mae do the selling at the boutique.

115
00:6:4,600-->00:6:9,600
And you can both benefit financially.

116
00:6:9,600-->00:6:11,600
I'm going to call Rita Mae right now.

117
00:6:11,600-->00:6:17,600
Oh, Susan, thank you so much

118
00:6:17,600-->00:6:20,600
for coming all this way from the city to talk to me about it.

119
00:6:20,600-->00:6:22,600
I hope you don't mind

120
00:6:22,600-->00:6:24,600
having taken so much time away from your busy schedule.

121
00:6:24,600-->00:6:25,600
Are you kidding?

122
00:6:25,600-->00:6:27,600
I don't mind at all.

123
00:6:27,600-->00:6:29,600
As a matter of fact,

124
00:6:29,600-->00:6:32,600
I came to spend some time with my favorite nephew.

125
00:6:32,600-->00:6:34,600
I think you should call Rita Mae right now.

126
00:6:34,600-->00:6:37,600
I think your idea of working at home is perfect.

127
00:6:37,600-->00:6:39,600
I don't know what I would do without you.

128
00:6:39,600-->00:6:42,600
I'm lucky to have you all.

129
00:6:42,600-->00:6:45,600
We are lucky to have you, Marilyn.

130
00:6:45,600-->00:6:48,600
And so is Max.
