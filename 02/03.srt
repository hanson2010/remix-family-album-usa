1
00:0:50,000-->00:0:53,000
And give her a teaspoon of the medicine after every meal.

2
00:0:53,000-->00:0:55,000
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

3
00:0:55,000-->00:0:59,000
You're welcome. Good-bye.

4
00:1:6,500-->00:1:12,000
How are you?

5
00:1:12,000-->00:1:14,000
I'm tired and hungry.

6
00:1:14,000-->00:1:16,000
Well, Marilyn and Richard called.

7
00:1:16,000-->00:1:18,000
They'll be here soon, and then we'll eat.

8
00:1:18,000-->00:1:21,000
All right. Is... is Susan coming?

9
00:1:21,000-->00:1:23,000
Well, she'll be here later.

10
00:1:23,000-->00:1:25,000
She has to work late tonight.

11
00:1:25,000-->00:1:27,000
And what's Robbie cooking for dinner?

12
00:1:27,000-->00:1:29,000
It's a surprise.

13
00:1:29,000-->00:1:32,000
I hope it's pasta.

14
00:1:32,000-->00:1:39,000
Robbie, the dinner was terrific.

15
00:1:39,000-->00:1:41,000
Yes, it was delicious.

16
00:1:41,000-->00:1:44,000
What's for dessert?

17
00:1:44,000-->00:1:46,000
Oh, I forgot dessert.

18
00:1:46,000-->00:1:49,000
Robbie!

19
00:1:49,000-->00:1:50,000
Don't worry.

20
00:1:50,000-->00:1:52,000
We've got lots of ice cream.

21
00:1:52,000-->00:1:54,000
Oh, I'd love some ice cream.

22
00:1:54,000-->00:2:0,000
Well, there's chocolate and coffee and a little vanilla.

23
00:2:0,000-->00:2:1,000
I'll have vanilla.

24
00:2:1,000-->00:2:3,000
Is that all right with everyone?

25
00:2:3,000-->00:2:4,000
I'll have chocolate.

26
00:2:4,000-->00:2:6,000
Me, too.

27
00:2:6,000-->00:2:9,000
Uh, one scoop of coffee

28
00:2:9,000-->00:2:11,000
and one scoop of chocolate for me.

29
00:2:11,000-->00:2:15,000
Robbie, will you help me serve?

30
00:2:22,500-->00:2:28,000
I keep thinking about that bag of film. Eight rolls.

31
00:2:28,000-->00:2:32,000
A whole day's work.

32
00:2:32,000-->00:2:34,000
And good stuff, too.

33
00:2:34,000-->00:2:36,000
Don't worry, Richard.

34
00:2:36,000-->00:2:37,000
Someone will find it.

35
00:2:37,000-->00:2:43,000
I'll get it. Hello.

36
00:2:43,000-->00:2:50,000
Hello.

37
00:2:50,000-->00:2:53,000
Does Richard Stewart live here?

38
00:2:53,000-->00:2:55,000
Yes, he's my brother.

39
00:2:55,000-->00:2:57,000
I'm Robbie... Robbie Stewart.

40
00:2:57,000-->00:3:0,000
I'm Alexandra Pappas.

41
00:3:0,000-->00:3:1,000
How do you do?

42
00:3:1,000-->00:3:5,000
Your brother left his bag of film on the ferryboat.

43
00:3:5,000-->00:3:6,000
I found it.

44
00:3:6,000-->00:3:8,000
I'm really glad to see you.

45
00:3:8,000-->00:3:11,000
I mean... my brother'll be really glad to see you!

46
00:3:11,000-->00:3:13,000
Robbie! Who is it?

47
00:3:13,000-->00:3:16,000
It's Richard's film!

48
00:3:16,000-->00:3:19,000
I mean, Alexandra Pappas.

49
00:3:19,000-->00:3:21,000
Come in, please.

50
00:3:21,000-->00:3:28,000
Alexandra!

51
00:3:28,000-->00:3:30,000
Hello, Richard. I found your bag!

52
00:3:30,000-->00:3:33,000
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

53
00:3:33,000-->00:3:35,000
Um... Alexandra, let me introduce you.

54
00:3:35,000-->00:3:37,000
This is my wife Marilyn.

55
00:3:37,000-->00:3:39,000
Richard showed me your photo.

56
00:3:39,000-->00:3:40,000
How do you do?

57
00:3:40,000-->00:3:41,000
Oh yes.

58
00:3:41,000-->00:3:42,000
Richard told us all about you.

59
00:3:42,000-->00:3:44,000
It's nice to meet you.

60
00:3:44,000-->00:3:46,000
And this is my mother, Ellen Stewart.

61
00:3:46,000-->00:3:47,000
How do you do?

62
00:3:47,000-->00:3:49,000
And my father, Dr. Philip Stewart.

63
00:3:49,000-->00:3:51,000
Nice to meet you, Alexandra.

64
00:3:51,000-->00:3:52,000
And... ah... you met Robbie.

65
00:3:52,000-->00:3:55,000
Yes. And you must be Susan. Hi.

66
00:3:55,000-->00:3:57,000
Hi. Welcome.

67
00:3:57,000-->00:3:59,000
I'm so glad you found the bag

68
00:3:59,000-->00:4:2,000
and took the time and trouble to return it.

69
00:4:2,000-->00:4:3,000
Oh, it was no trouble.

70
00:4:3,000-->00:4:5,000
I just took the wrong train.

71
00:4:5,000-->00:4:7,000
Would you like something to eat?

72
00:4:7,000-->00:4:8,000
Thank you, no.

73
00:4:8,000-->00:4:10,000
I'm late for dinner at my house.

74
00:4:10,000-->00:4:11,000
I really have to go.

75
00:4:11,000-->00:4:13,000
Would you like to call home?

76
00:4:13,000-->00:4:14,000
I'd appreciate that.

77
00:4:14,000-->00:4:16,000
Please, use the phone.

78
00:4:16,000-->00:4:18,000
Thanks. Excuse me.

79
00:4:18,000-->00:4:22,000
Alexandra is a high-school exchange student from Greece.

80
00:4:22,000-->00:4:23,000
Where does she live?

81
00:4:23,000-->00:4:25,000
With a family in the Bronx.

82
00:4:25,000-->00:4:27,000
Oh, that's not too far from here!

83
00:4:27,000-->00:4:29,000
Take it easy, Robbie.

84
00:4:29,000-->00:4:31,000
Thank you.

85
00:4:31,000-->00:4:33,000
I can only stay a few minutes.

86
00:4:33,000-->00:4:36,000
Have some iced tea.

87
00:4:36,000-->00:4:38,000
Thanks, Mrs. Stewart.

88
00:4:38,000-->00:4:41,000
Please sit down, Alexandra.

89
00:4:41,000-->00:4:50,000
So, you're an exchange student.

90
00:4:50,000-->00:4:51,000
Where do you go to school?

91
00:4:51,000-->00:4:54,000
At the Bronx High School of Science.

92
00:4:54,000-->00:4:56,000
Oh, that's a very good school.

93
00:4:56,000-->00:4:58,000
What are your favorite subjects?

94
00:4:58,000-->00:5:0,000
Biology and mathematics.

95
00:5:0,000-->00:5:2,000
Richard tells me you're a doctor.

96
00:5:2,000-->00:5:4,000
Yes, a pediatrician.

97
00:5:4,000-->00:5:6,000
And what does your father do?

98
00:5:6,000-->00:5:9,000
He's a lawyer, in Thessaloniki.

99
00:5:9,000-->00:5:10,000
Would you like some pasta?

100
00:5:10,000-->00:5:12,000
I made it myself.

101
00:5:12,000-->00:5:13,000
It might be a little cold.

102
00:5:13,000-->00:5:18,000
Thanks, no. I do have to go.

103
00:5:18,000-->00:5:20,000
It was nice meeting you all.

104
00:5:20,000-->00:5:22,000
Well, maybe you'll come for lunch some Sunday,

105
00:5:22,000-->00:5:24,000
so we can really thank you

106
00:5:24,000-->00:5:25,000
for bringing Richard's bag back.

107
00:5:25,000-->00:5:26,000
Maybe.

108
00:5:26,000-->00:5:27,000
You're welcome anytime.

109
00:5:27,000-->00:5:30,000
Good-bye.

110
00:5:30,000-->00:5:37,000
Can I drive you home?

111
00:5:37,000-->00:5:38,000
No, thanks.

112
00:5:38,000-->00:5:39,000
The train is just up the street.

113
00:5:39,000-->00:5:40,000
It won't take me long at all.

114
00:5:40,000-->00:5:43,000
Well, you really saved the day for me, Alexandra.

115
00:5:43,000-->00:5:45,000
Bye.

116
00:5:45,000-->00:5:46,000
Bye-bye.

117
00:5:46,000-->00:5:47,000
Good night.

118
00:5:47,000-->00:5:58,000
She's a smart young lady, and very nice.

119
00:5:58,000-->00:6:2,000
Very! Hey, she forgot her bag!

120
00:6:2,000-->00:6:5,000
I guess we'll be seeing Alexandra again.

121
00:6:5,000-->00:6:6,000
Right, Robbie?
