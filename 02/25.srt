1
00:2:4,600-->00:2:7,600
Who is it?

2
00:2:7,600-->00:2:9,600
Dad.

3
00:2:9,600-->00:2:11,600
Come on in, Dad.

4
00:2:11,600-->00:2:15,600
I thought you might be hungry.

5
00:2:15,600-->00:2:19,600
I brought you a chicken sandwich and a glass of milk.

6
00:2:19,600-->00:2:20,600
I am hungry.

7
00:2:20,600-->00:2:21,600
Thanks, Dad.

8
00:2:21,600-->00:2:24,600
What time is it, anyway?

9
00:2:24,600-->00:2:28,600
Ten o'clock.

10
00:2:28,600-->00:2:31,600
What are you working on?

11
00:2:31,600-->00:2:34,600
I'm writing a story for the high-school paper.

12
00:2:34,600-->00:2:37,600
Can't you finish it tomorrow?

13
00:2:37,600-->00:2:40,600
No, I have to turn it in in the morning.

14
00:2:40,600-->00:2:42,600
What's it about?

15
00:2:42,600-->00:2:46,600
I'm writing an article on the feelings about graduation.

16
00:2:46,600-->00:2:50,600
And ... how do you feel?

17
00:2:50,600-->00:2:52,600
Me?

18
00:2:52,600-->00:2:54,600
A little scared.

19
00:2:54,600-->00:2:56,600
And excited, too.

20
00:2:56,600-->00:3:0,600
I felt the same way.

21
00:3:0,600-->00:3:3,600
The scary part's leaving home and moving to college.

22
00:3:3,600-->00:3:8,600
Oh, leaving home is part of growing up.

23
00:3:8,600-->00:3:11,600
Well, don't work all night.

24
00:3:11,600-->00:3:13,600
I don't mind.

25
00:3:13,600-->00:3:14,600
I enjoy writing.

26
00:3:14,600-->00:3:15,600
Well,

27
00:3:15,600-->00:3:17,600
maybe you should think about becoming a writer.

28
00:3:17,600-->00:3:18,600
Maybe I should.

29
00:3:18,600-->00:3:22,600
You have lots of time to decide.

30
00:3:22,600-->00:3:24,600
That's the worst part--making decisions.

31
00:3:24,600-->00:3:27,600
You'll be OK.

32
00:3:27,600-->00:3:29,600
Good night, Son.

33
00:3:29,600-->00:3:30,600
Good night, Dad.

34
00:3:30,600-->00:3:42,600
"Hail to the victors valiant,

35
00:3:42,600-->00:3:45,600
Hail to the conquering heroes,

36
00:3:45,600-->00:3:46,600
Hail, Hail to Michigan,

37
00:3:46,600-->00:3:49,600
The champions of the West!"

38
00:3:49,600-->00:3:52,600
Ah, good morning, Robbie.

39
00:3:52,600-->00:3:53,600
Good morning, Dad.

40
00:3:53,600-->00:3:55,600
How's my grandson?

41
00:3:55,600-->00:3:57,600
Fine, Grandpa. Fine!

42
00:3:57,600-->00:3:58,600
What's all the cheering about?

43
00:3:58,600-->00:4:2,600
Did the University of Michigan win another football game?

44
00:4:2,600-->00:4:3,600
Better than that.

45
00:4:3,600-->00:4:4,600
Tell him, Philip.

46
00:4:4,600-->00:4:6,600
I just spoke with Charley Rafer.

47
00:4:6,600-->00:4:8,600
Who's Charley Rafer?

48
00:4:8,600-->00:4:12,600
He's the Dean of Admissions for the University of Michigan.

49
00:4:12,600-->00:4:15,600
And it turns out he's a classmate of Philip's.

50
00:4:15,600-->00:4:17,600
We were both on the tennis team.

51
00:4:17,600-->00:4:18,600
Great!

52
00:4:18,600-->00:4:20,600
It is great.

53
00:4:20,600-->00:4:22,600
He's going to be in New York tomorrow

54
00:4:22,600-->00:4:24,600
to interview applicants for admission.

55
00:4:24,600-->00:4:27,600
And he's agreed to fit you into his schedule.

56
00:4:27,600-->00:4:30,600
But I may not want to go to Michigan.

57
00:4:30,600-->00:4:33,600
It's one of the best schools in the country, Robbie.

58
00:4:33,600-->00:4:34,600
I studied medicine there.

59
00:4:34,600-->00:4:38,600
Your grandfather went to the Engineering School there.

60
00:4:38,600-->00:4:39,600
I know that, but...

61
00:4:39,600-->00:4:42,600
You said you wanted to be a doctor like your father.

62
00:4:42,600-->00:4:43,600
Not exactly.

63
00:4:43,600-->00:4:47,600
You couldn't pick a finer medical school than Michigan.

64
00:4:47,600-->00:4:48,600
Yes, I know that.

65
00:4:48,600-->00:4:51,600
Let's meet with Charley at the university club.

66
00:4:51,600-->00:4:53,600
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

67
00:4:53,600-->00:4:57,600
It doesn't mean you're going to Michigan.

68
00:4:57,600-->00:4:59,600
It doesn't mean you have to be a doctor.

69
00:4:59,600-->00:5:3,600
But the interview will be good experience for you.

70
00:5:3,600-->00:5:5,600
In that case, it's OK.

71
00:5:5,600-->00:5:9,600
Dad, growing up means

72
00:5:9,600-->00:5:11,600
making my own decisions, doesn't it?

73
00:5:11,600-->00:5:14,600
You're right, Robbie.

74
00:5:14,600-->00:5:17,600
But, like your Grandpa suggested,

75
00:5:17,600-->00:5:20,600
have the interview.

76
00:5:20,600-->00:5:23,600
And then make your own decision.

77
00:5:23,600-->00:5:26,600
That sounds fine.

78
00:5:26,600-->00:5:28,600
I know it's sudden, Robbie,

79
00:5:28,600-->00:5:30,600
but this is an important opportunity.

80
00:5:30,600-->00:5:33,600
We'll head down there first thing tomorrow morning.

81
00:5:33,600-->00:5:34,600
OK?

82
00:5:34,600-->00:5:35,600
Sure, Dad.

83
00:5:35,600-->00:5:39,600
I want you to know something, Son.

84
00:5:39,600-->00:5:46,600
I'm ... very proud of you.

85
00:5:46,600-->00:5:47,600
Thanks, Dad.

86
00:5:47,600-->00:5:52,600
Well, I've got an appointment at the hospital.

87
00:5:52,600-->00:5:54,600
I'll see you all at dinnertime.

88
00:5:54,600-->00:5:55,600
Bye, Dad.

89
00:5:55,600-->00:6:2,600
Is something still wrong, Robbie?

90
00:6:2,600-->00:6:5,600
I'll be OK.

91
00:6:5,600-->00:6:8,600
Going away to college for the first time

92
00:6:8,600-->00:6:13,600
always makes one a little nervous.

93
00:6:13,600-->00:6:15,600
I guess so.

94
00:6:15,600-->00:6:20,600
I'll be OK. I just need time to think.
