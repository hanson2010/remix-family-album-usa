00:0:50,000-->00:0:54,600
I love my school. I have so many good friends there now.

2
00:0:54,600-->00:0:56,600
I wouldn't miss a day even if I were really sick.

3
00:0:56,600-->00:1:0,600
Come and sit down for a minute, Michelle.

4
00:1:0,600-->00:1:5,600
I'd like to talk to you about something.

5
00:1:5,600-->00:1:7,600
Something important.

6
00:1:7,600-->00:1:9,600
What's wrong, Susan?

7
00:1:9,600-->00:1:12,600
Oh, there's nothing wrong, Michelle.

8
00:1:12,600-->00:1:14,600
But your daddy and I are talking about something

9
00:1:14,600-->00:1:16,600
that I'd like your opinion about.

10
00:1:16,600-->00:1:19,600
I know. I heard you talking about it

11
00:1:19,600-->00:1:21,600
the other night when I was trying on my new clothes.

12
00:1:21,600-->00:1:24,600
It's about moving to Los Angeles.

13
00:1:24,600-->00:1:29,600
You're right. How do you feel about it?

14
00:1:29,600-->00:1:34,600
Well, I really wouldn't want to move, but ...

15
00:1:34,600-->00:1:36,600
But?

16
00:1:36,600-->00:1:39,600
But if you and Daddy wanted to,

17
00:1:39,600-->00:1:42,600
I guess you know what's best for the family and for me.

18
00:1:42,600-->00:1:45,600
That's very considerate of you, Michelle.

19
00:1:45,600-->00:1:47,600
But what about your friends?

20
00:1:47,600-->00:1:48,600
I'd miss them a lot,

21
00:1:48,600-->00:1:51,600
but I know what it feels like to miss someone.

22
00:1:51,600-->00:1:55,600
Honey, we don't have to move

23
00:1:55,600-->00:1:57,600
if you're not going to be happy about it.

24
00:1:57,600-->00:1:59,600
Does Daddy want to move?

25
00:1:59,600-->00:2:3,600
I think so. He's going to tell us tonight about the job offer.

26
00:2:3,600-->00:2:12,600
Well, how was everybody's day today?

27
00:2:12,600-->00:2:15,600
Michelle was chosen to do Michelle

28
00:2:15,600-->00:2:17,600
the school poster for the play this year.

29
00:2:17,600-->00:2:19,600
Congratulations, Michelle! That's something!

30
00:2:19,600-->00:2:22,600
And how was your day, Susan?

31
00:2:22,600-->00:2:24,600
I see you're in a good mood.

32
00:2:24,600-->00:2:27,600
Why don't you tell us about your day.

33
00:2:27,600-->00:2:30,600
I met with Bill York.

34
00:2:30,600-->00:2:32,600
It's OK to talk about it, Harry.

35
00:2:32,600-->00:2:34,600
Michelle knows all about it. Michelle

36
00:2:34,600-->00:2:35,600
Really?

37
00:2:35,600-->00:2:37,600
Really, Harry.

38
00:2:37,600-->00:2:39,600
Michelle and I have all kinds of feelings Michelle

39
00:2:39,600-->00:2:42,600
about leaving New York, the family, and friends.

40
00:2:42,600-->00:2:47,600
But if you think you should take the job, we're behind you.

41
00:2:47,600-->00:2:49,600
What about Michelle's school?

42
00:2:49,600-->00:2:52,600
We'll move after the school term.

43
00:2:52,600-->00:2:53,600
What about her new friends?

44
00:2:53,600-->00:2:58,600
I'll make new friends wherever we are as long as we're together.

45
00:2:58,600-->00:3:1,600
We're a family, Harry.

46
00:3:1,600-->00:3:5,600
Whatever you think is right for you is right for us.

47
00:3:5,600-->00:3:12,600
I am so touched. The two of you are really something.

48
00:3:12,600-->00:3:14,600
We love you, Daddy.

49
00:3:14,600-->00:3:16,600
And I love you.

50
00:3:16,600-->00:3:20,600
OK. Now, tell us about your talk with Mr. York.

51
00:3:20,600-->00:3:21,600
Did you take the job?

52
00:3:21,600-->00:3:22,600
Nope.

53
00:3:22,600-->00:3:24,600
What?

54
00:3:24,600-->00:3:26,600
No? You didn't take it?

55
00:3:26,600-->00:3:29,600
No, I did not take the job.

56
00:3:29,600-->00:3:30,600
But, Daddy, I thought ...

57
00:3:30,600-->00:3:33,600
Harry, you didn't turn it down because of me ... Harry

58
00:3:33,600-->00:3:34,600
Or me?

59
00:3:34,600-->00:3:36,600
No, no. I turned it down because of me.

60
00:3:36,600-->00:3:37,600
How's that?

61
00:3:37,600-->00:3:42,600
Well, I began to think about you and about Michelle,

62
00:3:42,600-->00:3:44,600
and then I asked myself,

63
00:3:44,600-->00:3:47,600
do I really want to work for the biggest company in the country?

64
00:3:47,600-->00:3:49,600
And?

65
00:3:49,600-->00:3:50,600
And I don't.

66
00:3:50,600-->00:3:52,600
I went into business for myself

67
00:3:52,600-->00:3:54,600
because I like being my own boss.

68
00:3:54,600-->00:3:59,600
I run my own company. I'm a big fish in a little pond.

69
00:3:59,600-->00:4:2,600
I'm not really sure I want to be a little fish in a big pond.

70
00:4:2,600-->00:4:5,600
Oh, Daddy, does that mean we don't have to move?

71
00:4:5,600-->00:4:7,600
That's right, sweetheart.

72
00:4:7,600-->00:4:9,600
Are you sure?

73
00:4:9,600-->00:4:11,600
I couldn't be more sure, Susan.

74
00:4:11,600-->00:4:15,600
I'm glad if you are, Harry.

75
00:4:15,600-->00:4:17,600
And besides,

76
00:4:17,600-->00:4:18,600
how could I live in Los Angeles

77
00:4:18,600-->00:4:21,600
when all my favorite people live here?

78
00:4:21,600-->00:4:23,600
Your favorite people?

79
00:4:23,600-->00:4:24,600
Who's that?

80
00:4:24,600-->00:4:28,600
The Stewart family, of course.
