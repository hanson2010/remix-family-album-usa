00:0:47,600-->00:0:49,600
Hi, everyone. Sorry I'm late.

2
00:0:49,600-->00:0:52,000
But Alexandra and I

3
00:0:52,000-->00:0:53,000
have been busy at work this morning

4
00:0:53,000-->00:0:55,400
on the community-center project.

5
00:0:55,400-->00:0:58,000
And we brought someone along who can help.

6
00:0:58,000-->00:1:0,000
You remember Charles Maxwell, Grandpa?

7
00:1:0,000-->00:1:2,000
He's the editor of the Riverdale paper.

8
00:1:2,000-->00:1:4,000
He wrote some nice articles on Mom

9
00:1:4,000-->00:1:5,000
when she was running for the school board.

10
00:1:5,000-->00:1:8,000
Yes, I remember. You were a great help.

11
00:1:8,600-->00:1:9,600
Hi, Mr. Stewart.

12
00:1:9,600-->00:1:12,600
Hope to be a bigger help on the new community-center project.

13
00:1:12,600-->00:1:14,600
From what Robbie and Alexandra have told me,

14
00:1:14,600-->00:1:16,600
you people are making one big story.

15
00:1:16,600-->00:1:19,600
Let me introduce you, Mr. Maxwell.

16
00:1:19,600-->00:1:21,600
This is Nat Baker,

17
00:1:21,600-->00:1:24,600
who's responsible for this meeting,

18
00:1:24,600-->00:1:27,600
and this is Joanne Thompson, and Abe Lucas,

19
00:1:27,600-->00:1:28,600
who used to run the drugstore in town.

20
00:1:28,600-->00:1:31,600
Robbie and Alexandra told me

21
00:1:31,600-->00:1:32,600
what you need to fix up the old library.

22
00:1:32,600-->00:1:37,600
I am planning to write an editorial that I think will help you.

23
00:1:37,600-->00:1:41,600
Let's go. What are your questions?

24
00:1:41,600-->00:1:44,600
OK. Now, I have ... first ... a couple of questions here.

25
00:1:44,600-->00:1:46,600
Have you talked to the community council?

26
00:1:46,600-->00:1:50,600
And have you had an engineer come in to do an inspection?

27
00:1:50,600-->00:1:55,600
OK, what do you need most of all?

28
00:1:55,600-->00:1:56,600
People power.

29
00:1:56,600-->00:2:1,600
Men and women, young and old, to give us their time.

30
00:2:1,600-->00:2:2,600
To do what?

31
00:2:2,600-->00:2:6,600
To help scrub the building interior clean.

32
00:2:6,600-->00:2:7,600
So that we can repaint it.

33
00:2:7,600-->00:2:11,600
And you also need bodies to do repainting?

34
00:2:11,600-->00:2:12,600
That's right.

35
00:2:12,600-->00:2:15,600
And we'll also need some ladders

36
00:2:15,600-->00:2:18,600
and some brushes and some paint.

37
00:2:18,600-->00:2:20,600
When do you need the volunteers,

38
00:2:20,600-->00:2:21,600
and where do they report?

39
00:2:21,600-->00:2:23,600
I've got the council to agree

40
00:2:23,600-->00:2:26,600
to open the building for us on the next four weekends.

41
00:2:26,600-->00:2:27,600
How about furnishings?

42
00:2:27,600-->00:2:30,600
Are there any special requirements that I should list in the paper?

43
00:2:30,600-->00:2:31,600
Yes.

44
00:2:31,600-->00:2:35,600
Here is a copy of all the things we need to start with.

45
00:2:35,600-->00:2:37,600
Let's see. Four desks.

46
00:2:37,600-->00:2:40,600
Eight straight-back chairs. Thirty folding chairs.

47
00:2:40,600-->00:2:44,600
Six table lamps. Three end tables. One piano.

48
00:2:44,600-->00:2:46,600
This is a good start.

49
00:2:46,600-->00:2:49,600
These items shouldn't be difficult to come by

50
00:2:49,600-->00:2:51,600
once I print the article in the paper.

51
00:2:51,600-->00:2:53,600
This community has always been very generous.

52
00:2:53,600-->00:2:55,600
I agree, Mr. Maxwell.

53
00:2:55,600-->00:2:58,600
What you're saying is, in order for this center to succeed,

54
00:2:58,600-->00:3:0,600
we need to put together volunteers

55
00:3:0,600-->00:3:3,600
from the various generations of future users.

56
00:3:3,600-->00:3:4,600
That's right.

57
00:3:4,600-->00:3:7,600
And without their energy and stamina,

58
00:3:7,600-->00:3:9,600
there's no way we can complete this project.

59
00:3:9,600-->00:3:12,600
I've got it. Now give me some information about

60
00:3:12,600-->00:3:14,600
how you see the building being used.

61
00:3:14,600-->00:3:20,600
Oh, here. On the ground floor we have the reception area ...

62
00:3:20,600-->00:3:25,600
It's here, Robbie.

63
00:3:25,600-->00:3:29,600
Charles Maxwell lived up to his word.

64
00:3:29,600-->00:3:32,600
"At the Stewart family home on Linden Street yesterday,

65
00:3:32,600-->00:3:36,600
a group of caring Riverdale citizens gathered

66
00:3:36,600-->00:3:40,600
to plan the refurbishing of the old library

67
00:3:40,600-->00:3:44,600
to transform it into a new community center.

68
00:3:44,600-->00:3:47,600
The original plan by the council

69
00:3:47,600-->00:3:51,600
was tabled because of lack of funds.

70
00:3:51,600-->00:3:54,600
The new plan needs you.

71
00:3:54,600-->00:3:58,600
You could call it a community unity plan.

72
00:3:58,600-->00:4:3,600
It needs your time, and it needs your energy.

73
00:4:3,600-->00:4:7,600
And it needs your contributions of furniture,

74
00:4:7,600-->00:4:13,600
paint, brushes, ladders, lamps, et cetera.

75
00:4:13,600-->00:4:17,600
A list of these items and a volunteer form

76
00:4:17,600-->00:4:22,600
can be picked up at the Riverdale Press offices.

77
00:4:22,600-->00:4:25,600
By working together,

78
00:4:25,600-->00:4:29,600
this community can do anything to benefit its citizens,

79
00:4:29,600-->00:4:33,600
and we know you will all work together

80
00:4:33,600-->00:4:36,600
towards refurbishing the old library

81
00:4:36,600-->00:4:39,600
and making it a new community center.

82
00:4:39,600-->00:4:42,600
Charles Maxwell, Editor."
