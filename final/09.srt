Episode 09 - It's Up to You

3
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,120
Who is it?

4
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
Dad.

5
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,140
Come on in, Dad.

6
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,800
I thought you might be hungry.

7
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,800
I brought you a chicken sandwich and a glass of milk.

8
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,300
I am hungry.

9
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,580
Thanks, Dad.

10
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,840
What time is it, anyway?

11
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,300
Ten o'clock.

12
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,760
What are you working on?

13
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,360
I'm writing a story for the high-school paper.

14
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,960
Can't you finish it tomorrow?

15
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,600
No, I have to turn it in in the morning.

16
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,500
What's it about?

17
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm writing an article on the feelings about graduation.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,680
And... how do you feel?

19
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,260
Me?

20
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,820
A little scared.

21
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,880
And excited, too.

22
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,160
I felt the same way.

23
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,280
The scary part's leaving home and moving to college.

24
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,960
Oh, leaving home is part of growing up.

25
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,640
Well, don't work all night.

26
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,460
I don't mind. I enjoy writing.

27
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,480
Well, maybe you should think about becoming a writer.

28
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,060
Maybe I should.

29
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,980
You have lots of time to decide.

30
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,020
That's the worst part - making decisions.

31
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,760
You'll be OK.

32
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,060
Good night, Son.

33
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,000
Good night, Dad.

34
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,620
"Hail to the victors valiant,

35
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,020
Hail to the conquering heroes,

36
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,080
Hail, Hail to Michigan,

37
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,820
The champions of the West!"

38
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,700
Ah, good morning, Robbie.

39
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,780
Good morning, Dad.

40
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,260
How's my grandson?

41
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,120
Fine, Grandpa. Fine!

42
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,920
What's all the cheering about?

43
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,740
Did the University of Michigan win another football game?

44
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,120
Better than that.

45
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,460
Tell him, Philip.

46
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,040
I just spoke with Charley Rafer.

47
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,900
Who's Charley Rafer?

48
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,980
He's the Dean of Admissions for the University of Michigan.

49
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,860
And it turns out he's a classmate of Philip's.

50
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,040
We were both on the tennis team.

51
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,380
Great!

52
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,220
It is great.

53
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,060
He's going to be in New York tomorrow

54
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,100
to interview applicants for admission.

55
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,760
And he's agreed to fit you into his schedule.

56
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,200
But I may not want to go to Michigan.

57
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,500
It's one of the best schools in the country, Robbie.

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,860
I studied medicine there.

59
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,780
Your grandfather went to the Engineering School there.

60
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,520
I know that, but...

61
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,360
You said you wanted to be a doctor like your father.

62
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,160
Not exactly.

63
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,300
You couldn't pick a finer medical school than Michigan.

64
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,700
Yes, I know that.

65
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,940
Let's meet with Charley at the university club.

66
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,060
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

67
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,440
It doesn't mean you're going to Michigan.

68
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,040
It doesn't mean you have to be a doctor.

69
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,300
But the interview will be good experience for you.

70
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,400
In that case, it's OK.

71
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,540
Dad, growing up means

72
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,140
making my own decisions, doesn't it?

73
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,180
You're right, Robbie.

74
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,860
But, like your Grandpa suggested,

75
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,900
have the interview.

76
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,560
And then make your own decision.

77
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,260
That sounds fine.

78
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,880
I know it's sudden, Robbie,

79
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,380
but this is an important opportunity.

80
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,940
We'll head down there first thing tomorrow morning.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,540
OK?

82
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,960
Sure, Dad.

83
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,880
I want you to know something, Son.

84
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,060
I'm... very proud of you.

85
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,040
Thanks, Dad.

86
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,460
Well, I've got an appointment at the hospital.

87
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,720
I'll see you all at dinnertime.

88
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,840
Bye, Dad.

89
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,960
Is something still wrong, Robbie?

90
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,160
I'll be OK.

91
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,000
Going away to college for the first time

92
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,460
always makes one a little nervous.

93
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,920
I guess so.

94
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,320
I'll be OK. I just need time to think.

95
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,180
Sorry, Robbie.

96
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,500
Sorry to be late this morning, but,

97
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,880
well, we've still got some time for a cup of coffee.

98
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,420
I can't wait to see my old pal Charley Rafer.

99
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,840
Neither can I.

100
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,300
So you thought about it, huh?

101
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,760
Yes, I have, Dad.

102
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,980
Well, I'm glad.

103
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,560
I knew you'd realize that

104
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,160
this interview could be an important experience for you.

105
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,400
I came to that conclusion.

106
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,160
That's very wise, Robbie.

107
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,300
Very wise.

108
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,500
Now let's head off for the city and the university club.

109
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,800
Thanks, Dad.

110
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,800
Thanks... for what?

111
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,900
Thanks for hearing me out. And...

112
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,040
And...?

113
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,320
And thanks for being such an understanding father.

114
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,140
Well, thank you, Robbie. Thank you.

115
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,960
Philip Stewart!

116
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,740
It's great to see you!

117
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,800
Charley Rafer, you look as young as ever.

118
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,560
You must be Robbie.

119
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,920
Hi.

120
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,760
Yes, this is my youngest son Robbie.

121
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,780
Robbie, I want you to meet

122
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,720
one of the best tennis players on the Michigan team -

123
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,220
Charley Rafer.

124
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,740
Nice to meet you, Dean Rafer.

125
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,840
Well, are you as good a tennis player as your dad?

126
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,060
No, I'm not very good at it.

127
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,500
Frankly, neither was I.

128
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,060
Charley was the star of the team.

129
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,700
Yeah. Thanks.

130
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,440
Well, how've you been, Philip?

131
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,100
Oh, working too hard.

132
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,260
Doesn't show.

133
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,400
How's Ellen?

134
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,080
Fine, thank you.

135
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,380
And how's Marge?

136
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,240
She's still giving the toughest English history exams

137
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,540
in the school and loving every minute of it.

138
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,520
And speaking of minutes,

139
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,520
I have interviews until noon,

140
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,580
so why don't we get right to work?

141
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,860
Can you have lunch with us later?

142
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,720
I'd love to, Philip, but I'm afraid I can't.

143
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,140
I'm only here two days,

144
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,740
and I have interviews with 26 applicants.

145
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,120
I understand.

146
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,940
Well, thanks.

147
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,840
I'll wait outside.

148
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,120
Good luck, Son.

149
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,400
Did you bring your transcript from high school?

150
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,120
Yes, sir.

151
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,900
Right here.

152
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,600
Thank you.

153
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,560
Please sit down.

154
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,000
I see under "activities" that

155
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,500
you've been writing for the school paper.

156
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,700
Yes, sir.

157
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,960
What kinds of articles have you written?

158
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,800
All kinds - sports, editorials, theater reviews.

159
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,360
You name it, I've written it.

160
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,380
Hmmm.

161
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,400
Well, have you ever thought of becoming a journalist?

162
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,300
A professional writer?

163
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,460
Not until recently.

164
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,620
Michigan has a fine School of Journalism.

165
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,620
Yes, I know that.

166
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,980
You seem to have some reservations.

167
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,540
I'm a little uncertain.

168
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,500
It's been very nice talking to you.

169
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,260
Nice talking to you, sir.

170
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,680
One piece of advice.

171
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,360
The most important thing is for you to decide your own future.

172
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,520
Yes, sir.

173
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,380
Good-bye, Dean Rafer.

174
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,400
Good-bye, Robbie.

175
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,080
Good luck.

176
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,400
I had an interview today, too.

177
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,680
I had a great interview

178
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,100
with Admissions at Columbia University.

179
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,060
Really?

180
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,360
What did they say?

181
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,860
Will you get into the school?

182
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,940
Well, they didn't say anything for sure.

183
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,660
But I figure that with my grades and with my personality,

184
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,840
I'll have no problem.

185
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,560
Columbia's a terrific school.

186
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,940
What are you going to do?

187
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,200
Do? I don't know.

188
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,480
I also applied to NYU.

189
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,440
You sound excited about Columbia.

190
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,240
What's your problem, Mike?

191
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,900
Indecision. Indecision.

192
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,840
It's not easy,

193
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,940
and this is an important decision we have to make.

194
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,240
What about you?

195
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,040
How was your interview with Michigan?

196
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,920
The interview was fine.

197
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,500
It's a great college.

198
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,820
It is.

199
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,060
My father would like me to go there.

200
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,900
He and my Grandpa both went there.

201
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,160
Great medical school, too.

202
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
I know.

203
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,160
You can follow in your father's footsteps.

204
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,740
Ah! I'd like to follow in my own footsteps, Mike.

205
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,400
What do you want to study?

206
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,800
I've been thinking.

207
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,440
I think I want to study journalism

208
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,000
to be a reporter - a newspaperman.

209
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,900
You do a pretty good job on the Riverdale High School paper.

210
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,400
And I've been thinking about it a lot lately.

211
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,460
Have you discussed it with your parents?

212
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,540
No. But I have to.

213
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,820
OK. Let's talk.

214
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,060
Hi, Son. Is everything all right?

215
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,440
Hi, Dad. Everything's fine.

216
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,780
I was just waiting for you to get home

217
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,740
so we could talk.

218
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,440
Anything special you want to talk about?

219
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,060
There is, Dad.

220
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,540
I'm listening.

221
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:22,240
Well, I know you and Mom have given up a lot

222
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,600
to save money for my college tuition.

223
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,640
We want you to go to college, Robbie.

224
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,100
I know. I do.

225
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,940
But?

226
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,880
Well, I've thought a lot about which college,

227
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,640
and one of them is Columbia.

228
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,600
Columbia? Why Columbia?

229
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,940
First, they have an excellent School of Journalism.

230
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,040
They do.

231
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,940
And your friends are planning to go to Columbia?

232
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,940
That's only part of it.

233
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,760
It's complicated.

234
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll try to explain.

235
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,660
Mike and I had a hamburger this afternoon, and we talked.

236
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,940
Yes?

237
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,420
Well, we talked about a lot of things.

238
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,260
He applied to Columbia,

239
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,060
and his interview was very successful.

240
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,680
He thinks he'll be accepted,

241
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,640
and he really wants to go there.

242
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,180
Dean Rafer called me today.

243
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,000
He told me he was very impressed with you.

244
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,760
He's a nice man.

245
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,280
He was very kind.

246
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,800
He told me

247
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,340
you had some doubts about wanting to go to Michigan.

248
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,560
Yes. I do.

249
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,360
I'm just not sure about what I want to do.

250
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,600
That's OK.

251
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,020
You understand?

252
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,260
Let me tell you something, Robbie.

253
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,420
Something that might be surprising to you.

254
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,400
What? Tell me.

255
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:07,700
Well, Grandpa wanted me to study engineering, like him.

256
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,780
Well, I wasn't clear about my future,

257
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,960
but I knew engineering was not for me.

258
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,760
What did you tell Grandpa?

259
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,080
The truth.

260
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,000
Then you're not upset

261
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,660
about my not wanting to go into medicine?

262
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,560
I'm not upset at all.

263
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,540
I'm just happy that we're able to talk about it.

264
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,660
I am too, Dad.

265
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,000
I suppose you want to apply to Columbia.

266
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,360
Yes, but I also want to apply to several other colleges.

267
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,160
I thought you wanted to go to Columbia.

268
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,400
Well, I might want to go to Columbia.

269
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,240
But I might not.

270
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,000
I just want to be able to make my own decision.

271
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,540
You're a real Stewart!

272
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,300
And if I think about it long enough, you never know...

273
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,040
Never know what?

274
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,440
If I make my own decision,

275
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,260
I might choose Michigan.

276
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,500
Robbie, you're something!

277
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,140
You know, when I was your age,

278
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,840
I said exactly the same thing to Grandpa.
