Episode 09 - It's Up to You

3
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Who is it?

4
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Dad.

5
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Come on in, Dad.

6
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,600
I thought you might be hungry.

7
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,600
I brought you a chicken sandwich and a glass of milk.

8
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
I am hungry.

9
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Thanks, Dad.

10
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
What time is it, anyway?

11
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Ten o'clock.

12
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
What are you working on?

13
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,600
I'm writing a story for the high-school paper.

14
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Can't you finish it tomorrow?

15
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,600
No, I have to turn it in in the morning.

16
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
What's it about?

17
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,600
I'm writing an article on the feelings about graduation.

18
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,600
And ... how do you feel?

19
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Me?

20
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
A little scared.

21
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
And excited, too.

22
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,600
I felt the same way.

23
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
The scary part's leaving home and moving to college.

24
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Oh, leaving home is part of growing up.

25
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Well, don't work all night.

26
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
I don't mind.

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I enjoy writing.

28
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Well,

29
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
maybe you should think about becoming a writer.

30
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Maybe I should.

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,600
You have lots of time to decide.

32
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
That's the worst part--making decisions.

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
You'll be OK.

34
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Good night, Son.

35
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Good night, Dad.

36
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:23,600
"Hail to the victors valiant,

37
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Hail to the conquering heroes,

38
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Hail, Hail to Michigan,

39
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
The champions of the West!"

40
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Ah, good morning, Robbie.

41
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Good morning, Dad.

42
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
How's my grandson?

43
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Fine, Grandpa. Fine!

44
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
What's all the cheering about?

45
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Did the University of Michigan win another football game?

46
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Better than that.

47
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Tell him, Philip.

48
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
I just spoke with Charley Rafer.

49
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Who's Charley Rafer?

50
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,600
He's the Dean of Admissions for the University of Michigan.

51
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
And it turns out he's a classmate of Philip's.

52
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
We were both on the tennis team.

53
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Great!

54
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
It is great.

55
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
He's going to be in New York tomorrow

56
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
to interview applicants for admission.

57
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
And he's agreed to fit you into his schedule.

58
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
But I may not want to go to Michigan.

59
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,600
It's one of the best schools in the country, Robbie.

60
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
I studied medicine there.

61
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Your grandfather went to the Engineering School there.

62
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
I know that, but ...

63
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
You said you wanted to be a doctor like your father.

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Not exactly.

65
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,600
You couldn't pick a finer medical school than Michigan.

66
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Yes, I know that.

67
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Let's meet with Charley at the university club.

68
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

69
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,600
It doesn't mean you're going to Michigan.

70
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
It doesn't mean you have to be a doctor.

71
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,600
But the interview will be good experience for you.

72
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
In that case, it's OK.

73
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Dad, growing up means

74
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
making my own decisions, doesn't it?

75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,600
You're right, Robbie.

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
But, like your Grandpa suggested,

77
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,600
have the interview.

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,600
And then make your own decision.

79
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,600
That sounds fine.

80
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
I know it's sudden, Robbie,

81
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
but this is an important opportunity.

82
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
We'll head down there first thing tomorrow morning.

83
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
OK?

84
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Sure, Dad.

85
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,600
I want you to know something, Son.

86
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,600
I'm ... very proud of you.

87
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Thanks, Dad.

88
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Well, I've got an appointment at the hospital.

89
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
I'll see you all at dinnertime.

90
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Bye, Dad.

91
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Is something still wrong, Robbie?

92
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
I'll be OK.

93
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Going away to college for the first time

94
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,600
always makes one a little nervous.

95
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
I guess so.

96
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I'll be OK. I just need time to think.

97
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,100
Sorry, Robbie.

98
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,100
Sorry to be late this morning,but,

99
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,100
well, we've still got some time for a cup of coffee

100
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,100
I can't wait to see my old pal Charley Rafer.

101
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,100
Neither can I.

102
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:12,100
So you thought about it, huh?

103
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Yes, I have, Dad.

104
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Well, I'm glad.

105
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100
I knew you'd realize

106
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,100
that this interview could be an important experience for you.

107
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,100
I came to that conclusion.

108
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,100
That's very wise, Robbie.

109
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
Very wise.

110
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,100
Now let's head off for the city and the university club.

111
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Thanks, Dad.

112
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
Thanks ... for what?

113
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
Thanks for hearing me out. And ...

114
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
And ...?

115
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,100
And thanks for being such an understanding father.

116
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Well, thank you, Robbie. Thank you.

117
00:09:45,100 --> 00:10:00,100
Philip Stewart! Philip Stewart

118
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,100
It's great to see you!

119
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Charley Rafer--you look as young as ever. Charley Rafer

120
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,100
You must be Robbie.

121
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,100
Hi.

122
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Yes, this is my youngest son Robbie.

123
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Robbie, I want you to meet Robbie

124
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,100
one of the best tennis players on the Michigan team--

125
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
Charley Rafer. Charley Rafer

126
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
Nice to meet you, Dean Rafer.

127
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,100
Well, are you as good a tennis player as your dad?

128
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
No, I'm not very good at it.

129
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Frankly, neither was I.

130
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Charley was the star of the team. Charley

131
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
Yeah. Thanks.

132
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,100
Well, how're you been, Philip?

133
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Oh, working too hard.

134
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Doesn't show.

135
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
How's Ellen? Ellen

136
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Fine, thank you.

137
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,100
And how's Marge? Marge

138
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,100
She's still giving the toughest English history exams

139
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,100
in the school and loving every minute of it.

140
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
And speaking of minutes,

141
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
I have interviews until noon,

142
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
so why don't we get right to work?

143
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Can you have lunch with us later?

144
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,100
I'd love to, Philip, but I'm afraid I can't.

145
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100
I'm only here two days,

146
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,100
and I have interviews with twenty-six applicants.

147
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
I understand.

148
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,100
Well, thanks.

149
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,100
I'll wait outside.

150
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,100
Good luck, Son.

151
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,100
Did you bring your transcript from high school?

152
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Yes, sir.

153
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Right here.

154
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,100
Thank you.

155
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Please sit down.

156
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,100
I see under "activities" that

157
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
you've been writing for the school paper.

158
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
Yes, sir.

159
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,100
What kinds of articles have you written?

160
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,100
All kinds--sports, editorials, theater reviews.

161
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
You name it, I've written it.

162
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
Hmmm.

163
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Well, have you ever thought of becoming a journalist?

164
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
A professional writer?

165
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Not until recently.

166
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Michigan has a fine School of Journalism. Michigan

167
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Yes, I know that.

168
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,100
You seem to have some reservations.

169
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,100
I'm a little uncertain.

170
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,100
It's been very nice talking to you.

171
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,100
Nice talking to you, sir.

172
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
One piece of advice.

173
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:13,100
The most important thing is for you to decide your own future.

174
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,100
Yes, sir.

175
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,100
Good-bye, Dean Rafer.

176
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Good-bye, Robbie.

177
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Good luck.

178
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,500
I had an interview today, too.

179
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
I had a great interview

180
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,100
with Admissions at Columbia University.

181
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Really?

182
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
What did they say?

183
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
Will you get into the school?

184
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
Well, they didn't say anything for sure.

185
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,100
But I figure that with my grades and with my personality,

186
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,100
I'll have no problem.

187
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Columbia's a terrific school. Columbia

188
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
What are you going to do?

189
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,100
Do? I don't know.

190
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
I also applied to NYU.

191
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,100
You sound excited about Columbia.

192
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
What's your problem, Mike?

193
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Indecision. Indecision.

194
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,100
It's not easy,

195
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
and this is an important decision we have to make.

196
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
What about you?

197
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,100
How was your interview with Michigan?

198
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
The interview was fine.

199
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,100
It's a great college.

200
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,100
It is.

201
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,100
My father would like me to go there.

202
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,100
He and my Grandpa both went there.

203
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,100
Great medical school, too.

204
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
I know.

205
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
You can follow in your father's footsteps.

206
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Ah! I'd like to follow in my own footsteps, Mike.

207
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,100
What do you want to study?

208
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,100
I've been thinking.

209
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
I think I want to study journalism

210
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,100
to be a reporter--a newspaperman.

211
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
You do a pretty good job on the Riverdale High School paper.

212
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,100
And I've been thinking about it a lot lately.

213
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Have you discussed it with your parents?

214
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,100
No. But I have to.

215
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
OK. Let's talk.

216
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Hi, Son. Is everything all right?

217
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,100
Hi, Dad. Everything's fine.

218
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,100
I was just waiting for you to get home

219
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,100
so we could talk.

220
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
Anything special you want to talk about?

221
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,100
There is, Dad.

222
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,100
I'm listening.

223
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,100
Well, I know you and Mom have given up a lot

224
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:57,100
to save money for my college tuition.

225
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,100
We want you to go to college, Robbie.

226
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,100
I know. I do.

227
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
But?

228
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Well, I've thought a lot about which college,

229
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,100
and one of them is Columbia.

230
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Columbia? Why Columbia? Columbia

231
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,100
First, they have an excellent School of Journalism.

232
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,100
They do.

233
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:27,100
And your friends are planning to go to Columbia?

234
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,100
That's only part of it.

235
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,100
It's complicated.

236
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,100
I'll try to explain.

237
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Mike and I had a hamburger this afternoon, and we talked.

238
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
Yes?

239
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,100
Well, we talked about a lot of things.

240
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
He applied to Columbia,

241
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
and his interview was very successful.

242
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
He thinks he'll be accepted,

243
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
and he really wants to go there.

244
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Dean Rafer called me today. Rafer

245
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,100
He told me he was very impressed with you.

246
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
He's a nice man.

247
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
He was very kind.

248
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
He told me

249
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,100
you had some doubts about wanting to go to Michigan.

250
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Yes. I do.

251
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,100
I'm just not sure about what I want to do.

252
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,100
That's OK.

253
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,100
You understand?

254
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,100
Let me tell you something, Robbie.

255
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:30,100
Something that might be surprising to you.

256
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,100
What? Tell me.

257
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Well, Grandpa wanted me to study engineering, like him.

258
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,100
Well, I wasn't clear about my future,

259
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:51,100
but I knew engineering was not for me.

260
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,100
What did you tell Grandpa?

261
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
The truth.

262
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,100
Then you're not upset

263
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,100
about my not wanting to go into medicine?

264
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,100
I'm not upset at all.

265
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,100
I'm just happy that we're able to talk about it.

266
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,100
I am too, Dad.

267
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:18,100
I suppose you want to apply to Columbia.

268
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,100
Yes, but I also want to apply to several other colleges.

269
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,100
I thought you wanted to go to Columbia.

270
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Well, I might want to go to Columbia.

271
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,100
But I might not.

272
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,100
I just want to be able to make my own decision.

273
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,100
You're a real Stewart!

274
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,100
And if I think about it long enough, you never know ...

275
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
Never know what?

276
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,100
If I make my own decision,

277
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,100
I might choose Michigan.

278
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Robbie, you're something! Robbie

279
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,100
You know, when I was your age,

280
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,100
I said exactly the same thing to Grandpa.
