Episode 05 - The Right Magic

3
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:12,354
Hi, Grandpa.

4
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:13,725
Hi, Robbie.

5
00:02:14,182 --> 00:02:15,142
Can I help?

6
00:02:15,577 --> 00:02:16,731
Yes, indeed.

7
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,160
Hand me two eggs from the refrigerator,

8
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:22,891
and I'll make you two fried eggs.

9
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:26,468
How about some bacon?

10
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:29,382
I made enough for an army.

11
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,080
You going to the baseball game today?

12
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:37,382
It's a perfect day for it, a little cloudy but nice and warm.

13
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:39,371
Dad and I were planning to go to the game,

14
00:02:39,474 --> 00:02:40,788
but he has to work today,

15
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:42,594
and my friends don't want to go.

16
00:02:42,765 --> 00:02:44,582
It's not an important game, anyway.

17
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:47,542
Do you have any other plans for the day?

18
00:02:48,182 --> 00:02:50,057
I'll work on my computer.

19
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:53,234
I have a new math program, and I want to learn how to use it.

20
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:55,000
Maybe you can teach me

21
00:02:55,017 --> 00:02:56,948
how to work on a computer someday.

22
00:02:56,982 --> 00:03:00,651
Anytime. It's really easy, but, like anything,

23
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:02,640
you need to work at it, Grandpa.

24
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,411
This bacon is great.

25
00:03:06,502 --> 00:03:08,274
I love crispy bacon.

26
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,662
Oh, what are you doing tomorrow?

27
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:13,062
Nothing much.

28
00:03:14,182 --> 00:03:18,800
Well, maybe your dad and I could take you fishing with us.

29
00:03:19,142 --> 00:03:20,742
I'd like that, but...

30
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:22,982
But what?

31
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:25,234
But Dad is always so busy.

32
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:29,988
Well, can you come fishing with me tomorrow?

33
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:33,245
Sure, I can.

34
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,262
Robbie says you can't take him to the game today.

35
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:39,657
I really feel bad about it,

36
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,634
but they need me at the hospital today,

37
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,800
in the children's ward.

38
00:03:43,017 --> 00:03:44,400
I understand.

39
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:47,794
Maybe we can spend some time together next weekend.

40
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:49,142
Definitely.

41
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:50,228
We should.

42
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:52,422
You and Robbie and me.

43
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,371
Remember our first fishing trip?

44
00:03:55,965 --> 00:03:57,257
I sure do...

45
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:01,142
Well, I've got to run, Dad.

46
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,434
See you later.

47
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:06,068
Going fishing?

48
00:04:06,377 --> 00:04:08,034
I'm thinking about it...

49
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,234
So, how's work?

50
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,725
Oh, the usual problems.

51
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:16,617
You're working pretty hard these days.

52
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,400
I guess I am.

53
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:24,468
When did you last go fishing with Robbie?

54
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:26,925
I remember exactly.

55
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,800
It was on his birthday, June second, two years ago.

56
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,251
We didn't catch anything.

57
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,022
Remember our fishing trips?

58
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:40,857
Yes. I loved them.

59
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,748
Remember catching your first fish?

60
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:48,354
How can I forget?

61
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,754
I fell out of the boat!

62
00:04:52,777 --> 00:04:54,765
We had some good times together.

63
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:57,154
Yes, we did.

64
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,022
Maybe we should do it again.

65
00:05:01,622 --> 00:05:03,108
How about tomorrow?

66
00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:05,120
Don't you have to work?

67
00:05:05,268 --> 00:05:07,851
My paper work will wait.

68
00:05:07,897 --> 00:05:10,582
Oh, Robbie will be thrilled.

69
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:12,388
I am, too, Son.

70
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:14,365
I want to spend more time with Robbie.

71
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:16,057
Tomorrow.

72
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:18,925
It'll be like old times for you and me.

73
00:05:19,131 --> 00:05:20,822
And Robbie will love it.

74
00:05:21,805 --> 00:05:25,154
Well, what's the weather going to be like?

75
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:28,651
Radio says sunny and mild.

76
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:35,337
Well, I'll tell Robbie.

77
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:40,960
And thanks, Dad.

78
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,674
Don't thank me.

79
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,891
I'm just being a grandfather.

80
00:08:50,262 --> 00:08:52,160
This is really neat!

81
00:08:53,497 --> 00:08:54,994
When do we eat?

82
00:08:56,582 --> 00:08:58,857
First, we have to catch some fish.

83
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,777
In order to catch fish, you have to do this.

84
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,417
Here we go.

85
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:09,085
That's it.

86
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:15,691
Then drop it into the water.

87
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:19,565
All of this comes before eating. OK?

88
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:21,748
How do you know so much about fishing?

89
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,817
Grandpa taught me.

90
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:26,354
We spent a lot of time fishing together.

91
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:37,017
Now, the important thing is to get the hook close to the fish.

92
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:38,045
All right?

93
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:38,880
Like this.

94
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:50,000
I think I see some fish right under us, Dad.

95
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:51,737
Oh, not a chance!

96
00:09:52,022 --> 00:09:53,508
I just saw a big one!

97
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:55,508
Hi, there!

98
00:09:55,622 --> 00:09:56,171
Hi.

99
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:57,497
What's your name?

100
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:58,297
Albert.

101
00:09:58,685 --> 00:09:59,840
Are you all alone?

102
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:00,868
Yes, sir.

103
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,971
How old are you, Albert?

104
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:04,411
I'm ten.

105
00:10:06,582 --> 00:10:08,022
Where's your father?

106
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:09,714
He's up there at the lodge.

107
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:14,148
Does he know you're here?

108
00:10:14,342 --> 00:10:15,428
Yes, sir.

109
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:19,302
OK, Robbie, maybe you should watch him.

110
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,994
The water's pretty deep here.

111
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,468
I'll watch him, Dad.

112
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:30,891
What time is it?

113
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:34,902
It's almost lunchtime, and no fish yet.

114
00:10:35,165 --> 00:10:37,874
I can go up to the lodge for some hot dogs and drinks.

115
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,188
No way!

116
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:41,508
We're here to catch our lunch.

117
00:10:41,645 --> 00:10:44,982
To catch fish, you need the right magic.

118
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:46,434
That's right.

119
00:10:46,457 --> 00:10:48,205
I forgot! The right magic.

120
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:50,525
Do it for Robbie, Dad.

121
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:51,520
You remember?

122
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,457
Sure. Come on.

123
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:57,291
Well, first, you have to turn your hat around like this.

124
00:10:57,508 --> 00:11:01,965
Then you close your eyes and say the magic words.

125
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:06,948
Fish, fish, send me a fish.

126
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:18,320
Fish, fish, send me a fish... I got one!

127
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,588
See, it works!

128
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:21,451
It's a big one!

129
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:23,131
Well, it always worked for me, too.

130
00:11:24,171 --> 00:11:26,320
Grandpa, get the net, please!

131
00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:36,034
Dad, you got one, too!

132
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,085
You bet I have!

133
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,291
Easy, Philip, easy.

134
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,371
Sorry, Dad.

135
00:11:46,502 --> 00:11:50,491
Well, one more and I've got a pair of boots.

136
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:54,125
You didn't say the magic words.

137
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,348
Robbie's right.

138
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:58,137
Yes, but you did, and we've got our lunch.

139
00:11:58,365 --> 00:11:59,657
Let's build a fire and cook it!

140
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,645
Come on, Albert, you can help us!

141
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:03,520
I want to stay here and fish.

142
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:07,714
All right, but be careful.

143
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:18,331
Is it finished yet?

144
00:12:18,342 --> 00:12:19,302
I think so.

145
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:22,994
I hope you like your fish well done.

146
00:12:23,314 --> 00:12:24,902
Burned, you mean.

147
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,725
Hey, I'm a doctor, not a chef.

148
00:12:38,022 --> 00:12:41,440
Help! Help! I can't swim!

149
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,508
Dad! Grandpa! He fell in!

150
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,462
Easy does it, Robbie.

151
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,605
That a boy.

152
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:05,462
That's it.

153
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:06,720
He's not breathing, Philip!

154
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,548
Robbie, run to the car!

155
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,794
Bring a blanket and my medical bag.

156
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:10,800
Yes, Dad.

157
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:14,800
Now, come on, son. Come on, son.

158
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:25,028
Breathe, Albert!

159
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,354
Here's the bag.

160
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:11,565
Will he be OK, Dad?

161
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:12,857
I hope so.

162
00:16:18,754 --> 00:16:19,840
That's it.

163
00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:21,062
That's the way.

164
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,142
That's it. There.

165
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:26,617
Oh, it's going to be all right.

166
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:27,165
That's it.

167
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:29,108
Wrap him in the blanket, Dad!

168
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:30,971
That's it. That's it.

169
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:33,634
It's all right, Albert.

170
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,245
You're going to be OK.

171
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:38,091
I want my daddy!

172
00:16:38,194 --> 00:16:39,154
We'll take you to him.

173
00:16:39,154 --> 00:16:44,057
Easy now. Easy does it. That's it.

174
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,640
Your dad is quite a guy.

175
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:50,068
I know, Grandpa.

176
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,205
How is he, Philip?

177
00:16:52,297 --> 00:16:53,245
He's asleep.

178
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:54,285
He's going to be fine.

179
00:16:54,937 --> 00:16:56,228
How can I thank all of you?

180
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,805
Thank my son Robbie.

181
00:16:57,862 --> 00:16:58,960
He pulled him out of the water.

182
00:16:59,028 --> 00:17:00,342
I'm very grateful, Robbie.

183
00:17:00,377 --> 00:17:02,080
Dad saved him, not me.

184
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,034
I'm so thankful to all of you.

185
00:17:05,748 --> 00:17:06,765
So long.

186
00:17:08,377 --> 00:17:10,297
He's a lucky boy.

187
00:17:10,674 --> 00:17:13,554
Well, what do you say we get back to our fishing?

188
00:17:13,748 --> 00:17:15,622
That's a great idea.

189
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,920
Uh-oh. It's probably the hospital.

190
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:23,005
I have to get to a phone.

191
00:17:23,885 --> 00:17:26,011
It probably means we can't stay.

192
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,371
That's OK.

193
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:35,131
One of my patients has a high fever,

194
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:36,811
and I have to go to the hospital.

195
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,577
I'm sorry, Robbie.

196
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:41,131
I guess I ruined your day.

197
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,348
You didn't ruin my day, Dad.

198
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:49,748
I understand. I really do.

199
00:18:16,506 --> 00:18:18,093
Why are you back so early?

200
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:20,186
Philip had to go back to the hospital.

201
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:21,373
He had an emergency.

202
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,933
Oh, that's too bad, Robbie.

203
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,120
Did it spoil your fun?

204
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:27,626
No, Mom. We had a great time.

205
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,506
Well, did you do any fishing?

206
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:32,440
Yeah, we caught lots of them. Look!

207
00:18:36,386 --> 00:18:39,360
They had a special on frozen fish down at the supermarket.

208
00:18:39,413 --> 00:18:43,173
Oh, you really had a bad day.

209
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:44,893
We had a good day.

210
00:18:45,306 --> 00:18:47,706
Robbie pulled a boy out of the water.

211
00:18:47,946 --> 00:18:49,746
And Dad saved his life.

212
00:18:50,693 --> 00:18:53,000
He's a terrific doctor, Mom.

213
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,626
I know.

214
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,706
Hi, Pop. Hi, Son.

215
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,720
Hello, Dad.

216
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,040
What a day!

217
00:19:12,266 --> 00:19:14,266
How about a cup of coffee, Son?

218
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,413
I'd love a cup of coffee.

219
00:19:23,586 --> 00:19:24,946
How was the patient?

220
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,626
She'll be fine.

221
00:19:27,173 --> 00:19:28,893
Was it serious?

222
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:30,560
No.

223
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:35,653
Until today, I was never really interested in medicine.

224
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,720
Well, it's hard work.

225
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,440
Now I know.

226
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:44,586
I had a good time today, Robbie.

227
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,946
Me, too.

228
00:19:46,706 --> 00:19:48,733
Why don't we do it again?

229
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,280
Can we? When?

230
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,106
How about next Saturday?

231
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,546
Won't you be busy?

232
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:59,026
I'm changing my schedule.

233
00:19:59,693 --> 00:20:01,640
Well, do we have a date?

234
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:03,333
We sure do, Dad.

235
00:20:03,826 --> 00:20:05,733
Grandpa, can you come?

236
00:20:06,146 --> 00:20:08,493
I have other plans, Robbie.

237
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:13,080
But I think you two can have a good time together without me.

238
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:18,360
No, Dad, and certainly not without the right magic.
