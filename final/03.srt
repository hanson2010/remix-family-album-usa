Episode 03 - Grandpa's Trunk

3
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:54,320
Marilyn, you want coffee or tea?

4
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,352
Coffee, please.

5
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,144
I am so excited!

6
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,968
At this time tomorrow morning,

7
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,016
Grandpa will be sitting in the kitchen with us.

8
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,312
When does he arrive?

9
00:02:22,864 --> 00:02:24,600
At six o'clock this evening.

10
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,696
By plane?

11
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,096
No, by train.

12
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:32,624
Are we picking him up at the station?

13
00:02:33,232 --> 00:02:34,688
Not Grandpa.

14
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,192
He doesn't want anybody picking him up.

15
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:39,704
He likes to be independent.

16
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,528
Oh, let's go upstairs and prepare Grandpa's room.

17
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,120
Great! Let's do it!

18
00:02:47,816 --> 00:02:48,488
Good morning, Mom.

19
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:49,168
Morning.

20
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,500
Well, hi, fellas.

21
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,200
Hello.
Well, hi, fellas.

22
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,040
Hi, honey.

23
00:02:51,048 --> 00:02:51,920
Morning, Marilyn.

24
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,656
We are going upstairs to set up Grandpa's room.

25
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,000
There's coffee ready.

26
00:02:58,232 --> 00:03:00,320
I'm really excited about seeing Grandpa.

27
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:03,352
Me, too. Milk, please.

28
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:05,320
He's so funny.

29
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,808
He always makes me laugh.

30
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,424
I hope Grandpa's going to like living with us.

31
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,536
I think he will.

32
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,520
It just takes time to feel comfortable in a new place.

33
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,072
Won't he miss being in Florida?

34
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:17,992
Well, he will.

35
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,104
But I think he'll like being here with the family.

36
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,616
Are you sure about that?

37
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,288
It's crazy here most of the time.

38
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,512
But it's fun.

39
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,592
That's for sure.

40
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:26,880
You know,

41
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,632
maybe I'll put together some photos of Grandpa

42
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:30,600
as a "welcome" present.

43
00:03:30,784 --> 00:03:32,472
That's a neat idea.

44
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:34,168
What can I do?

45
00:03:34,712 --> 00:03:35,696
I've got it!

46
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,608
I have a picture of Grandpa and Dad and me in my wallet.

47
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,128
It's from the Fathers and Sons' Breakfast

48
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,016
at my junior high school graduation.

49
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:46,912
Oh, I remember this picture.

50
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,776
I'd really like to pick up Grandpa at the railroad station.

51
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:54,288
Railroad stations or airports—

52
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,000
Grandpa always tells us he'll get here by himself.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,072
He's something!

54
00:04:03,704 --> 00:04:05,336
Is this all Grandpa's stuff?

55
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:07,328
That's it.

56
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:10,600
But I'm sure he has a few bags with him on the train.

57
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:13,600
What's inside?

58
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,392
I don't know. It's locked.

59
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,552
Hi.

60
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,392
Oh, hi, darling.

61
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,136
Morning, Philip.

62
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,320
I want to put some of my good hangers in Grandpa's closet.

63
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,640
You know I'm very excited about his arrival.

64
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:33,600
We are, too.

65
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,968
Susan called early this morning.

66
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,944
She's unhappy

67
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,112
because she's had to go to Chicago on a business trip

68
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,512
and can't leave till tonight.

69
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,328
She wants to be here for Grandpa.

70
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,344
Well, Grandpa will be disappointed, too.

71
00:04:47,008 --> 00:04:48,536
He loves Susan.

72
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,840
She always reminds him of Grandma.

73
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,432
Well, how's everything here?

74
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,936
Fine. We were just wondering about this trunk.

75
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:02,072
It's locked.

76
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,720
Oh. I have the key. Grandpa sent it to me.

77
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:32,608
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

78
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,960
No, it's not taken.

79
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,136
Oh, thank you.

80
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,824
Oh, let me help you with this.

81
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,408
Oh, thank you.

82
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:44,768
Do you want to sit by the window?

83
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,640
No, no, no. I like the aisle seat better.

84
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,512
Please, you sit by the window.

85
00:07:56,024 --> 00:07:58,280
My name is Stewart... Malcolm Stewart.

86
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,328
Pleased to meet you.

87
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,656
I'm Elsa Tobin. How do you do?

88
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:09,400
Do you live in New York?

89
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
No, no. I'm from Florida.

90
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,992
I am, too. But didn't you just get on?

91
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,848
No, no. I just changed my seat.

92
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,240
A man next to me was smoking,

93
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,040
and smoke really bothers me.

94
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,448
Where are you from in Florida?

95
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,360
Titusville. It's near Orlando.

96
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,648
Small world. I'm from Titusville, too.

97
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,464
Really? What part?

98
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,120
My husband and I live near Spaceport.

99
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,792
I know that area.

100
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,336
My house is only a few miles from Spaceport.

101
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:50,104
Do you still live there?

102
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,600
Oh yes, yes. My husband's there now.

103
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,448
He couldn't take time off to come to New York with me.

104
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,440
Do you still live there?

105
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,416
No. I sold the house and the furniture,

106
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,368
put a few personal things in an old trunk,

107
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,576
and shipped it to my children in New York.

108
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:15,880
That's my destination.

109
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,336
Are you married?

110
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:20,688
My wife died four years ago.

111
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:25,256
She was a wonderful woman. A real friend.

112
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:29,784
I'm sorry. Really, I'm sorry.

113
00:09:31,128 --> 00:09:33,112
Lots of wonderful memories.

114
00:09:34,256 --> 00:09:36,416
We were married almost fifty years.

115
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,152
Well, forty-seven, to be exact.

116
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,632
John and I celebrate our fortieth anniversary next month.

117
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,824
Oh, congratulations! That's nice.

118
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,888
What does John do?

119
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,944
He's an aerospace engineer

120
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,824
and works for Orlando Aircraft Corporation.

121
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:59,600
He started with them almost forty years ago.

122
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,440
What do you do?

123
00:10:02,152 --> 00:10:07,128
I just retired. Had my own company.

124
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,584
A construction company. Roads, bridges, big stuff.

125
00:10:13,752 --> 00:10:17,680
But I just sold it and retired.

126
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:23,192
Excuse me, ma'am. Ticket, please.

127
00:10:26,616 --> 00:10:29,304
Would you kindly hold these keys, please?

128
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,864
I have a ticket, I know.

129
00:10:33,272 --> 00:10:35,280
I was in the smoking section.

130
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,808
It's OK, lady. Take your time.

131
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:40,840
I'm sure it's in your purse, Mrs. Tobin.

132
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:44,040
Oh, here it is.

133
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,000
And here are your keys.

134
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,064
Thank you.

135
00:10:55,424 --> 00:10:57,784
Do you have family in New York?

136
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,680
No, no. But I do have very close friends in New York City.

137
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:05,568
We like to go to the theater together.

138
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:08,696
You said you have family in New York.

139
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,368
Yes, indeed.

140
00:11:10,768 --> 00:11:14,776
A son and his wife and their three children—

141
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,120
my grandchildren.

142
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,448
You must be excited.

143
00:11:18,296 --> 00:11:20,512
I can't wait, to see them!

144
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:23,040
Are you going to live with them?

145
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:24,064
Yes.

146
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,120
Permanently?

147
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:29,584
Well... they want me to,

148
00:11:29,904 --> 00:11:32,432
but it's too early to know for sure.

149
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,152
I'm pretty independent.

150
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:39,208
I tried to teach my kids the importance of independence,

151
00:11:40,104 --> 00:11:44,048
but I'm not sure I want to be alone.

152
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:49,848
Some people don't mind being alone. I do.

153
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,576
I understand. But tell me.

154
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,576
Why did you stop working?

155
00:11:57,936 --> 00:12:05,552
I retired because... I wanted to be with my family.

156
00:12:06,072 --> 00:12:09,920
I didn't want to be alone anymore!

157
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

158
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,904
Amtrak is happy to announce our arrival in New York City.

159
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,392
The train will be stopping in five minutes.

160
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,272
Please check to be sure you have your belongings.

161
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,304
And have a good stay in the Big Apple.

162
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,440
Thank you.

163
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,752
Well, here we are.

164
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,408
It was so nice meeting you, Mr. Stewart.

165
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,096
And nice meeting you, too, Mrs. Tobin.

166
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,872
Please look us up.

167
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,216
We're in the phone book.

168
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,296
Dr. Philip Stewart, in Riverdale.

169
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,240
Your son?

170
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,960
That's right. And have a good time in New York.

171
00:15:31,168 --> 00:15:33,472
And don't be so independent.

172
00:15:33,696 --> 00:15:36,376
You're very lucky to have a caring family.

173
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,464
When can we go fishing?

174
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,632
Robbie, we'll go fishing soon,

175
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,648
and we'll take your dad with us.

176
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,224
I'm ready, Grandpa. You name the day.

177
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:01,784
That's a great idea, Grandpa!

178
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,512
Philip needs a day off.

179
00:16:04,112 --> 00:16:05,968
Let's give him our presents now.

180
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,136
Good idea.

181
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:09,816
Presents, for me?

182
00:16:12,744 --> 00:16:14,720
From me and Marilyn.

183
00:16:15,144 --> 00:16:16,544
And this one's from me.

184
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,936
I looked all over the house to find it.

185
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,840
Richard, these are terrific pictures.

186
00:16:44,992 --> 00:16:47,856
This one really brings back memories.

187
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:52,400
You remember that day, Robbie?

188
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,720
I sure do. It was fun.

189
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:05,592
Oh, I'm sorry Susan isn't here.

190
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,728
I miss her very much.

191
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,784
She feels bad, too, Grandpa.

192
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,032
She called to say the plane was delayed.

193
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,072
You know airports.

194
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:16,544
I can't wait to see her.

195
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,048
She looks just like Grandma at that age.

196
00:17:23,472 --> 00:17:25,016
I'd better unpack.

197
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:28,224
I started traveling twenty-four hours ago.

198
00:17:31,824 --> 00:17:34,384
I'm not so young anymore.

199
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,008
Don't you want something to eat?

200
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,184
No, thanks.

201
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,528
After a good night's sleep, I'll enjoy breakfast even more.

202
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,160
Well, come on, Dad.

203
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,864
Ellen and I'll take you to your room.

204
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,944
I'm sure glad you're here, Grandpa.

205
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,440
Good night, Grandpa.

206
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,720
Pleasant dreams.

207
00:18:05,672 --> 00:18:09,144
Philip, do you have the key to the trunk?

208
00:18:09,448 --> 00:18:12,440
I have the key, but it doesn't work.

209
00:18:18,528 --> 00:18:21,632
I sent the wrong key.

210
00:18:32,648 --> 00:18:37,800
I have something for you. I made it myself.

211
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,896
I think you'll enjoy it.

212
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:45,248
I researched it for over a year.

213
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,560
It's our family tree.

214
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:55,672
Oh, Grandpa! How exciting!

215
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,136
Fabulous!

216
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:02,032
Why, I didn't know that your grandfather was born in Germany.

217
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,288
Lots of interesting information about our family.

218
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,456
A gift from me.

219
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:10,776
Thank you so much.

220
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,960
Grandpa! Grandpa!

221
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,808
Oh, Grandpa, I'm so happy to see you!

222
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,824
Oh, you look so beautiful, Susan. My granddaughter.

223
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,480
Like I always said, you look just like Grandma.

224
00:19:28,672 --> 00:19:33,104
I think you're going to be very happy here with us.

225
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,568
I know you will.

226
00:19:35,712 --> 00:19:38,408
I don't feel alone anymore.
