Episode 03 - Grandpa's Trunk

3
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Marilyn, you want coffee or tea? Marilyn

4
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Coffee, please.

5
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:15,600
I am so excited!

6
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
At this time tomorrow morning,

7
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Grandpa will be sitting in the kitchen with us.

8
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
When does he arrive?

9
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
At six o'clock this evening.

10
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
By plane?

11
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
No, by train.

12
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Are we picking him up at the station?

13
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Not Grandpa.

14
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
He doesn't want anybody picking him up.

15
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
He likes to be independent.

16
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Oh, let's go upstairs and prepare Grandpa's room.

17
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Great! Let's do it!

18
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Good morning, Mom.

19
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Morning.

20
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Well, hi, fellas.

21
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,000
Hello.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,600
Hi, honey.

23
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Morning, Marilyn.

24
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
We are going upstairs to set up Grandpa's room.

25
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
There's coffee ready.

26
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I'm really excited about seeing Grandpa.

27
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Me, too. Milk, please.

28
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
He's so funny.

29
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
He always makes me laugh.

30
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,600
I hope Grandpa's going to like living with us.

31
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
I think he will.

32
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
It just takes time to feel comfortable in a new place.

33
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Won't he miss being in Florida?

34
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Well, he will.

35
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
But I think he'll like being here with the family.

36
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Are you sure about that?

37
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
It's crazy here most of the time.

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
But it's fun.

39
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
That's for sure.

40
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
You know,

41
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
maybe I'll put together some photos of Grandpa

42
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
as a "welcome" present.

43
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
That's a neat idea.

44
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
What can I do?

45
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
I've got it!

46
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I have a picture of Grandpa and Dad and me in my wallet.

47
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
It's from the Fathers and Sons' Breakfast

48
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
at my junior high school graduation.

49
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Oh, I remember this picture.

50
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,600
I'd really like to pick up Grandpa at the railroad station.

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Railroad stations or airports--

52
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Grandpa always tells us he'll get here by himself.

53
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
He's something!

54
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Is this all Grandpa's stuff?

55
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
That's it.

56
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,600
But I'm sure he has a few bags with him on the train.

57
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,600
What's inside?

58
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,600
I don't know. It's locked.

59
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Hi.

60
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Oh, hi, darling.

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Morning, Philip.

62
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
I want to put some of my good hangers in Grandpa's closet.

63
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
You know I'm very excited about his arrival.

64
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
We are, too.

65
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Susan called early this morning. Susan

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
She's unhappy

67
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
because she's had to go to Chicago on a business trip

68
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
and can't leave till tonight.

69
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
She wants to be here for Grandpa.

70
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Well, Grandpa will be disappointed, too.

71
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
He loves Susan.

72
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
She always reminds him of Grandma. Susan

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Well, how's everything here?

74
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Fine. We were just wondering about this trunk.

75
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,600
It's locked.

76
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Oh. I have the key. Grandpa sent it to me.

77
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,100
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

78
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,100
No, it's not taken.

79
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Oh, thank you.

80
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Oh, let me help you with this.

81
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,100
Oh, thank you.

82
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Do you want to sit by the window?

83
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,100
No, no, no. I like the aisle seat better.

84
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Please, you sit by the window.

85
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:32,100
My name is Stewart... Malcolm Stewart.

86
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,100
Pleased to meet you.

87
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,100
I'm Elsa Tobin. How do you do?

88
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Do you live in New York?

89
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,100
No, no. I'm from Florida.

90
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,100
I am, too. But didn't you just get on?

91
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,100
No, no. I just changed my seat.

92
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,100
A man next to me was smoking,

93
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,100
and smoke really bothers me.

94
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,100
Where are you from in Florida?

95
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Titusville. It's near Orlando. Titusville

96
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,100
Small world. I'm from Titusville, too.

97
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,100
Really? What part?

98
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
My husband and I live near Spaceport.

99
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,100
I know that area.

100
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,100
My house is only a few miles from Spaceport.

101
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Do you still live there?

102
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
Oh yes, yes. My husband's there now.

103
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,100
He couldn't take time off to come to New York with me.

104
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Do you still live there?

105
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,100
No. I sold the house and the furniture,

106
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,100
put a few personal things in an old trunk,

107
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,100
and shipped it to my children in New York.

108
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
That's my destination.

109
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,100
Are you married?

110
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,100
My wife died four years ago.

111
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,100
She was a wonderful woman. A real friend.

112
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,100
I'm sorry. Really, I'm sorry.

113
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Lots of wonderful memories.

114
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,100
We were married almost fifty years.

115
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,100
Well, forty-seven, to be exact.

116
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,100
John and I celebrate our fortieth anniversary next month.

117
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Oh, congratulations! That's nice.

118
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,100
What does John do? John

119
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,100
He's an aerospace engineer

120
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,100
and works for Orlando Aircraft Corporation.

121
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:33,100
He started with them almost forty years ago.

122
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,100
What do you do?

123
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,100
I just retired. Had my own company.

124
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:46,100
A construction company. Roads, bridges, big stuff.

125
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,100
But I just sold it and retired.

126
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:57,100
Excuse me, ma'am. Ticket, please.

127
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Would you kindly hold these keys, please?

128
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,100
I have a ticket, I know.

129
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
I was in the smoking section.

130
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
It's OK, lady. Take your time.

131
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,100
I'm sure it's in your purse, Mrs. Tobin.

132
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,100
Oh, here it is.

133
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,100
And here are your keys.

134
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
Thank you.

135
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Do you have family in New York?

136
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,100
No, no. But I do have very close friends in New York City.

137
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,100
We like to go to the theater together.

138
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,100
You said you have family in New York.

139
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
Yes, indeed.

140
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,100
A son and his wife and their three children--

141
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,100
my grandchildren.

142
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,100
You must be excited.

143
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,100
I can't wait, to see them!

144
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,100
Are you going to live with them?

145
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,100
Yes.

146
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
Permanently?

147
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,100
Well... they want me to,

148
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,100
but it's too early to know for sure.

149
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,100
I'm pretty independent.

150
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,100
I tried to teach my kids the importance of independence,

151
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,100
but I'm not sure I want to be alone.

152
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Some people don't mind being alone. I do.

153
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,100
I understand. But tell me.

154
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
Why did you stop working?

155
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:39,100
I retired because... I wanted to be with my family.

156
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,100
I didn't want to be alone anymore!

157
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,100
Ladies and gentlemen,

158
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Amtrak is happy to announce our arrival in New York City.

159
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,100
The train will be stopping in five minutes.

160
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,100
Please check to be sure you have your belongings.

161
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,100
And have a good stay in the Big Apple.

162
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
Thank you.

163
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
Well, here we are.

164
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,100
It was so nice meeting you, Mr. Stewart.

165
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,100
And nice meeting you, too, Mrs. Tobin.

166
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,100
Please look us up.

167
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
We're in the phone book.

168
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Dr. Philip Stewart, in Riverdale. Philip Stewarrt

169
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Your son?

170
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,100
That's right. And have a good time in New York.

171
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,100
And don't be so independent.

172
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,100
You're very lucky to have a caring family.

173
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:46,100
When can we go fishing?

174
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,100
Robbie, we'll go fishing soon, Robbie

175
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,100
and we'll take your dad with us.

176
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,100
I'm ready, Grandpa. You name the day.

177
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
That's a great idea, Grandpa!

178
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Philip needs a day off. Philip

179
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Let's give him our presents--now.

180
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,100
Good idea.

181
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,100
Presents--for me?

182
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:10,100
From me and Marilyn. Marilyn

183
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
And this one's from me.

184
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,100
I looked all over the house to find it.

185
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Richard, these are terrific pictures. Richard

186
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:44,100
This one really brings back memories.

187
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,100
You remember that day, Robbie?

188
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,100
I sure do. It was fun.

189
00:16:50,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Oh, I'm sorry Susan isn't here.

190
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
I miss her very much.

191
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,100
She feels bad, too, Grandpa.

192
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,100
She called to say the plane was delayed.

193
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,100
You know airports.

194
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
I can't wait to see her.

195
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,100
She looks just like Grandma at that age.

196
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,100
I'd better unpack.

197
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,100
I started traveling twenty-four hours ago.

198
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,100
I'm not so young anymore.

199
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,100
Don't you want something to eat?

200
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,100
No, thanks.

201
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,100
After a good night's sleep, I'll enjoy breakfast even more.

202
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
Well, come on, Dad.

203
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Ellen and I'll take you to your room. Ellen

204
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,100
I'm sure glad you're here, Grandpa.

205
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Good night, Grandpa.

206
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
Pleasant dreams.

207
00:17:46,100 --> 00:18:05,100
Philip, do you have the key to the trunk? Philip

208
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,100
I have the key, but it doesn't work.

209
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:17,100
I sent the wrong key.

210
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:33,100
I have something for you. I made it myself.

211
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,100
I think you'll enjoy it.

212
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,100
I researched it for over a year.

213
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,100
It's our family tree.

214
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:51,100
Oh, Grandpa! How exciting!

215
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Fabulous!

216
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,100
Why, I didn't know that your grandfather was born in Germany.

217
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,100
Lots of interesting information about our family.

218
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,100
A gift from me.

219
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,100
Thank you so much.

220
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Grandpa! Grandpa!

221
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,100
Oh, Grandpa, I'm so happy to see you!

222
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Oh, you look so beautiful, Susan. My granddaughter.

223
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:24,100
Like I always said, you look just like Grandma.

224
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,100
I think you're going to be very happy here with us.

225
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,100
I know you will.

226
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:46,100
I don't feel alone anymore.
