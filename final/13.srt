Episode 13 - A Real Stewart

3
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,000
There's nothing more joyous than the arrival of a new baby.

4
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,060
I am so excited. Mother!

5
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,460
Just imagine - Marilyn and Richard must be thrilled!

6
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,740
Oh, a new baby!

7
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,700
Max... Max... Max.

8
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,980
Oh, it's a sweet-sounding name for a sweet little boy.

9
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,820
My first grandchild.

10
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,160
And my first nephew.

11
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,060
Isn't he just adorable?

12
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,360
He looks a lot like you, Mom. He does.

13
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,060
Do you think so?

14
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,100
Well, I guess. He does look a lot like Richard,

15
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,540
and I guess he looks a lot like me.

16
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,020
Oh, he's got Richard's eyes, though.

17
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,800
I really want Harry and Michelle to see Max.

18
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,500
When are they coming?

19
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,200
Tomorrow. Harry has an account to work on today.

20
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,960
Yes, he does have Richard's eyes. Big blue eyes.

21
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,420
The baby even looks at you like Richard does.

22
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,300
Well, children usually resemble their parents.

23
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,620
It's true.

24
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,000
Michelle is a lot like Harry in so many ways.

25
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,720
And she's shy with new people, just like he is.

26
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,620
You really like Michelle, don't you?

27
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,500
Yes. I'm very fond of her.

28
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,680
And Harry, too?

29
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,600
Well...

30
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,920
Uh, it's 4:30. Oh my!

31
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,340
Marilyn and Richard will be home from the hospital any minute,

32
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,860
and we must prepare this room.

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,580
Where will we put all the presents?

34
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,520
Well, let's take everything to the living room.

35
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,420
Marilyn and Richard and the baby need the space.

36
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,060
It's crowded in here.

37
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,160
The welcome sign is up:

38
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,920
"Welcome home, Max."

39
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,560
Isn't it exciting, Grandpa?

40
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,960
Your first great-grandchild.

41
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,120
Yes. Yes, sir.

42
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,720
A great-grandchild. A great-grandson.

43
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,420
Another generation to carry on the Stewart name.

44
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,920
I love you, Grandpa.

45
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,680
You make me feel so proud to be part of our family.

46
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,980
One day, you'll have your own family,

47
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,820
and I'll be proud to be part of it.

48
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,460
Now you understand my feelings, Susan.

49
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,940
I'm Grandpa's daughter-in-law, but I feel like a Stewart.

50
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,860
He's always made me feel like his own daughter.

51
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,160
that's because you're so much like us. Wonderful!

52
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,740
Mom, got it.

53
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,520
This will make a nice gift for Marilyn and Richard.

54
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,020
They can keep a record of all of the important dates

55
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,720
and information about Max's life here.

56
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,260
Let's see.

57
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,820
Name: Max Stewart.

58
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,720
Does he have a middle name?

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,060
No, just Max. I like that.

60
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,820
No middle name. No middle initial.

61
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,280
Like me. I'm Malcolm Stewart.

62
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,660
Just Malcolm Stewart.

63
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,900
And Max has your initials, Grandpa: M.S.

64
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,480
Uh, it must mean something.

65
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,820
Weight: eight pounds six ounces.

66
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,780
Eight-six. Big boy!

67
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,120
All the Stewart men were big.

68
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,600
Well, Robbie was eight pounds two ounces,

69
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,520
and Richard was eight pounds three.

70
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,320
And me?

71
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,360
Eight pounds six.

72
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,220
You were big, just like Max.

73
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,900
Eight pounds six, just like me.

74
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,960
That's nice. Length. Length?

75
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,900
Richard says Max is 21 inches long.

76
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,860
21 inches.

77
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,920
Is that tall or average or what?

78
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,660
Tall. All the Stewart men are tall.

79
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,440
Well, Grandpa, you're about five-nine or five-ten.

80
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,020
I wouldn't call that tall.

81
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,920
I take after my mother's family.

82
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,680
They were... they were... they were average.

83
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,600
Mother: Marilyn. Father: Richard.

84
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,480
And lots of pages for Richard's photos of Max.

85
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,600
Speaking of mother and of father

86
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,600
and speaking of Max, I hear the car.

87
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,180
They're here!

88
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,220
Oh! Oh, quickly! Go, go, go!
They're here!

89
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,680
Oh! Oh, quickly! Go, go, go!

90
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,760
Let's see. Oh, welcome home.

91
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,620
Oh, let her in.

92
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,360
Wait with your pictures for a second.

93
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,840
Come on, darlings.

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,320
Sweetheart, sit down right here.

95
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,600
Oh, he's so cute! Oh, Marilyn!

96
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,680
Max looks just like Grandpa.

97
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,860
A real Stewart.

98
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,880
I'm so happy to be home with my family and with Max.

99
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,060
It's almost ten o'clock.

100
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,800
I've got to go. Tomorrow is Monday,

101
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,180
and work begins at eight in the morning for me.

102
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,420
Oh, I'm so happy that Max is home.

103
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,860
He's the sweetest little thing.

104
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,020
I'll drive you to the station, dear.

105
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,780
You can catch the 10:20 train to Grand Central Station.

106
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,580
I'll drive Susan, dear.

107
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,240
Thank you, Philip.

108
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,900
Then Grandpa, Robbie,

109
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,340
and I can finish wrapping all these gifts.

110
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,340
It's so good to have you home again...

111
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:14,380
and to see Max asleep in his bassinet at home with us.

112
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,580
To be with our family and all that Stewart TLC.

113
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,200
TLC - tender loving care.

114
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,520
That's our motto.

115
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,120
Did you see the washcloth

116
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,640
and the towels with the teddy bears on them?

117
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,080
Alexandra and the Molinas sent them for Max.

118
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,660
It was so kind of them.

119
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,880
Now Max has come into everyone's life.

120
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,380
The house is so alive with him here.

121
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,000
The welcome sign over the door.

122
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,900
The boxes of presents.

123
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,000
The M-A-X over his bassinet.

124
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,980
Robbie put that there.

125
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,920
Susan's teddy bear.

126
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:09,660
So cuddly. The beautiful crib from Mom and Dad.

127
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,840
Oh, and Grandpa's baseball glove.

128
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,420
You know, it hung over my crib, too.

129
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,760
And it hung over Robbie's crib.

130
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,380
Part of Grandpa's magic?

131
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,720
Oh, that's not all.

132
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,000
It hung over Susan's crib.

133
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,560
The same baseball glove?

134
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,260
That's right. Grandpa hangs it there for good luck.

135
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,880
He says it always brought him good luck on the baseball team.

136
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,980
He believes it'll bring good luck to all the Stewart babies.

137
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,020
And then he takes it back

138
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,520
when Max is ready to use it?

139
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,120
Yes, and replaces it with a new glove

140
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,020
so the old one will be ready

141
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,000
for a new member of the Stewart family.

142
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,520
Grandpa really loves his family, doesn't he?

143
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,960
So do I.

144
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,580
And so do I.

145
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,560
And so does Max.

146
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,860
After he eats!

147
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,500
Thanks, Michelle.

148
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,000
I hope you like it.

149
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,440
Isn't this baby outfit adorable?

150
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,280
With his name on it - "Max".

151
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,500
Thanks so much, Harry and Michelle.

152
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,860
We really appreciate it.

153
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,820
I'm glad you like it.

154
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,820
Michelle picked it out.

155
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,300
Yes, I told Daddy to pick blue ones.

156
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,420
Blue is for boys, and pink is for girls.

157
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,160
And Max is some boy.

158
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,040
He's a real Stewart.

159
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,340
Right.

160
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,460
That was so thoughtful of you, Michelle.

161
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,040
Especially to pick it out in blue.

162
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,460
Would you like to see baby Max, Michelle?

163
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,200
Could she? Could we?

164
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,280
Could I?

165
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,060
Take them upstairs, Susan.

166
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,400
Harry and Michelle can watch Max sleeping.

167
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,740
Let's go.

168
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,320
Come on, Michelle.

169
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,680
Before Max wakes up.

170
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,260
Will you please take this upstairs, Susan?

171
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,820
Uh-huh.

172
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,620
Thank you.

173
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,120
Michelle is very grown up for a ten-year-old, huh?

174
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,940
She's smart and sensitive for her age.

175
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,540
Growing up without a mother is difficult.

176
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,780
You mature quickly.

177
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,660
Susan's like a mother to Michelle.

178
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,040
They have a good relationship.

179
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,760
Do you think Susan and Harry will get married?

180
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,820
Yeah. You can count on it.

181
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,580
I think so. Yes. They get along so well.

182
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,480
I like him. He's good for Susan.

183
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,820
He's a little quiet.

184
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,480
It's hard to do anything but listen in this family.

185
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,000
How can anybody get a word in around here?

186
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,160
You're right, Ellen.

187
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,820
Oh, really?

188
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,080
It's the way it should be.

189
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,740
The Stewarts are the Stewarts!

190
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,880
They always were,

191
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,040
and they always will be.

192
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,560
Right!

193
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,420
They've always got an opinion.

194
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,640
Always got something to say.

195
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,820
And now there's Max Stewart.

196
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,120
and if he talks as loudly as he cries,

197
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,220
we're all in for trouble.

198
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,920
He's quiet now.

199
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,560
Mmm-hmm. That's because he's sleeping.

200
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
He's really cute.

201
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,620
It's not necessary to whisper, Harry.

202
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,100
A baby gets used to voices.

203
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,660
I remember now.

204
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,880
We always whispered when Michelle was born.

205
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,820
And I didn't sleep well, Daddy told me.

206
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,840
I never slept.

207
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,700
And when I did,

208
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,640
I woke up when I heard someone speak.

209
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,340
I bet you were cute.

210
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,660
She sure was.

211
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,120
Not as cute as Max.

212
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,820
He's like a little doll.

213
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,040
Oh, good.

214
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,960
Now I can help diaper him.

215
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,880
Let's get Marilyn.

216
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,940
What do you do when he cries like that?

217
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,860
You pick him up.

218
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,860
He's so little... so new.

219
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,120
Let's call Marilyn.

220
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,420
Time for a feeding and time for a diapering.

221
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,340
You're a real Stewart.
