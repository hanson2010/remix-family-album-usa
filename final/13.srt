Episode 13 - A Real Stewart

3
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,600
There's nothing more joyous than the arrival of a new baby.

4
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
I am so excited. Mother!

5
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Just imagine--Marilyn and Richard must be thrilled!

6
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Oh, a new baby!

7
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Max... Max... Max.

8
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Oh, it's a sweet-sounding name for a sweet little boy.

9
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,600
My first grandchild.

10
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
And my first nephew.

11
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Isn't he just adorable?

12
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
He looks a lot like you, Mom. He does.

13
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Do you think so?

14
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Well, I guess. He does look a lot like Richard,

15
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
and I guess he looks a lot like me.

16
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Oh, he's got Richard's eyes, though.

17
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
I really want Harry and Michelle to see Max.

18
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,600
When are they coming?

19
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Tomorrow. Harry has an account to work on today.

20
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Yes, he does have Richard's eyes. Big blue eyes.

21
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,600
The baby even looks at you like Richard does.

22
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Well, children usually resemble their parents.

23
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
It's true.

24
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Michelle is a lot like Harry in so many ways.

25
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,600
And she's shy with new people, just like he is.

26
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,600
You really like Michelle, don't you?

27
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Yes. I'm very fond of her.

28
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
And Harry, too?

29
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Well...

30
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Uh, it's four-thirty. Oh my!

31
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Marilyn and Richard will be home from the hospital any minute,

32
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
and we must prepare this room.

33
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Where will we put all the presents?

34
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Well, let's take everything to the living room.

35
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Marilyn and Richard and the baby need the space.

36
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
It's crowded in here.

37
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,600
The welcome sign is up:

38
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
"Welcome home, Max."

39
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Isn't it exciting, Grandpa?

40
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Your first great-grandchild.

41
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Yes. Yes, sir.

42
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
A great-grandchild. A great-grandson.

43
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Another generation to carry on the Stewart name.

44
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
I love you, Grandpa.

45
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,600
You make me feel so proud to be part of our family.

46
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
One day, you'll have your own family,

47
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
and I'll be proud to be part of it.

48
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Now you understand my feelings, Susan.

49
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm Grandpa's daughter-in-law, but I feel like a Stewart.

50
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
He's always made me feel like his own daughter.

51
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,600
that's because you're so much like us. Wonderful!

52
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Mom, got it.

53
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,600
This will make a nice gift for Marilyn and Richard.

54
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,600
They can keep a record of all of the important dates

55
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
and information about Max's life here.

56
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Let's see.

57
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Name: Max Stewart.

58
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Does he have a middle name?

59
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,600
No, just Max. I like that.

60
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
No, just Max. I like that.

61
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
No middle name. No middle initial.

62
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Like me. I'm Malcolm Stewart.

63
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Just Malcolm Stewart.

64
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,600
And Max has your initials, Grandpa: M.S. Max

65
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Uh, it must mean something.

66
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Weight: eight pounds six ounces.

67
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Eight-six. Big boy!

68
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
All the Stewart men were big.

69
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Well, Robbie was eight pounds two ounces,

70
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
and Richard was eight pounds three.

71
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
And me?

72
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Eight pounds six.

73
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,600
You were big, just like Max.

74
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Eight pounds six, just like me.

75
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,600
That's nice. Length. Length?

76
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Richard says Max is twenty-one inches long.

77
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Twenty-one inches.

78
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Is that tall or average or what?

79
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Tall. All the Stewart men are tall.

80
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Well, Grandpa, you're about five-nine or five-ten.

81
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
I wouldn't call that tall.

82
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,600
I take after my mother's family.

83
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
I take after my mother's family.

84
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,600
They were... they were... they were average.

85
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Mother: Marilyn. Father: Richard.

86
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,600
And lots of pages for Richard's photos of Max.

87
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Speaking of mother and of father

88
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,600
and speaking of Max, I hear the car.

89
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
They're here!

90
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Oh! Oh, quickly! Go, go, go!

91
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Let's see. Oh, welcome home.

92
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Oh, let her in.

93
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Wait with your pictures for a second.

94
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Come on, darlings.

95
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Sweetheart, sit down right here.

96
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Oh, he's so cute! Oh, Marilyn!

97
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Max looks just like Grandpa.

98
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
A real Stewart.

99
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,600
I'm so happy to be home with my family and with Max.

100
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
It's almost ten o'clock.

101
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,600
I've got to go. Tomorrow is Monday,

102
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
and work begins at eight in the morning for me.

103
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Oh, I'm so happy that Max is home.

104
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
He's the sweetest little thing.

105
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
I'll drive you to the station, dear.

106
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,600
You can catch the ten-twenty train to Grand Central Station.

107
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I'll drive Susan, dear.

108
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Thank you, Philip.

109
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Then Grandpa, Robbie,

110
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
and I can finish wrapping all these gifts.

111
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,600
It's so good to have you home again...

112
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,600
and to see Max asleep in his bassinet at home with us.

113
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,600
To be with our family and all that Stewart TLC.

114
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:29,600
TLC - tender loving care.

115
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,600
That's our motto.

116
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Did you see the washcloth

117
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,600
and the towels with the teddy bears on them?

118
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Alexandra and the Molinas sent them for Max.

119
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,600
It was so kind of them.

120
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Now Max has come into everyone's life.

121
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
The house is so alive with him here.

122
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,600
The welcome sign over the door.

123
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,600
The boxes of presents.

124
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
The M-A-X over his bassinet.

125
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Robbie put that there.

126
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Susan's teddy bear.

127
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,600
So cuddly. The beautiful crib from Mom and Dad.

128
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Oh, and Grandpa's baseball glove.

129
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,600
You know, it hung over my crib, too.

130
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,600
And it hung over Robbie's crib.

131
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Part of Grandpa's magic?

132
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Oh, that's not all.

133
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
It hung over Susan's crib.

134
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
The same baseball glove?

135
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,600
That's right. Grandpa hangs it there for good luck.

136
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
He says it always brought him good luck on the baseball team.

137
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,600
He believes it'll bring good luck to all the Stewart babies.

138
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
And then he takes it back

139
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
when Max is ready to use it?

140
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Yes,

141
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
and replaces it with a new glove

142
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
so the old one will be ready

143
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
for a new member of the Stewart family.

144
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Grandpa really loves his family, doesn't he?

145
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,600
So do I.

146
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,600
And so do I.

147
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:11,600
And so does Max.

148
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,600
After he eats!

149
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Thanks, Michelle.

150
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
I hope you like it.

151
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Isn't this baby outfit adorable?

152
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,600
With his name on it - "Max".

153
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Thanks so much, Harry and Michelle.

154
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
We really appreciate it.

155
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
I'm glad you like it.

156
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
Michelle picked it out.

157
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Yes, I told Daddy to pick blue ones.

158
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Blue is for boys, and pink is for girls.

159
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
And Max is some boy.

160
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,600
He's a real Stewart.

161
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Right.

162
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,600
That was so thoughtful of you, Michelle.

163
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Especially to pick it out in blue.

164
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Would you like to see baby Max, Michelle?

165
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Could she? Could we?

166
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Could I?

167
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Take them upstairs, Susan.

168
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Harry and Michelle can watch Max sleeping.

169
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Let's go.

170
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
Come on, Michelle.

171
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Before Max wakes up.

172
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Will you please take this upstairs, Susan?

173
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Uh-huh.

174
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Thank you.

175
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:32,600
Michelle is very grown up for a ten-year-old, huh?

176
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,600
She's smart and sensitive for her age.

177
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Growing up without a mother is difficult.

178
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
You mature quickly.

179
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Susan's like a mother to Michelle.

180
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,600
They have a good relationship.

181
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Do you think Susan and Harry will get married?

182
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Yeah. You can count on it.

183
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,600
I think so. Yes. They get along so well.

184
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
I like him. He's good for Susan.

185
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,600
He's a little quiet.

186
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,600
It's hard to do anything but listen in this family.

187
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,600
How can anybody get a word in around here?

188
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
You're right, Ellen.

189
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Oh, really?

190
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
It's the way it should be.

191
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
The Stewarts are the Stewarts!

192
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
They always were,

193
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
and they always will be.

194
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Right!

195
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
They've always got an opinion.

196
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Always got something to say.

197
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,600
And now there's Max Stewart.

198
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,600
and if he talks as loudly as he cries,

199
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
we're all in for trouble.

200
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
He's quiet now.

201
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Mmm-hmm. That's because he's sleeping.

202
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:55,600
He's really cute.

203
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,600
It's not necessary to whisper, Harry.

204
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
A baby gets used to voices.

205
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
I remember now.

206
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
We always whispered when Michelle was born.

207
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,600
And I didn't sleep well, Daddy told me.

208
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
I never slept.

209
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
And when I did,

210
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
I woke up when I heard someone speak.

211
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
I bet you were cute.

212
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
She sure was.

213
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Not as cute as Max.

214
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
He's like a little doll.

215
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Oh, good.

216
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Now I can help diaper him.

217
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Let's get Marilyn.

218
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,600
What do you do when he cries like that?

219
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
You pick him up.

220
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,600
He's so little... so new.

221
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Let's call Marilyn.

222
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Time for a feeding and time for a diapering.

223
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600
You're a real Stewart.
