Episode 04 - A Piece of Cake

3
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,200
I am exhausted.

4
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,008
My new exercise class is so hard.

5
00:02:27,504 --> 00:02:29,376
Your new exercise class?

6
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:35,384
Yeah. My new advanced exercise class.

7
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:40,624
Why advanced?

8
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:45,010
My instructor thought that

9
00:02:45,044 --> 00:02:47,173
the beginner's class was too easy for me.

10
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:50,742
Too easy for you?

11
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:56,155
Don't laugh. In the beginner's class,

12
00:02:56,617 --> 00:02:59,355
they give you a chance to rest between exercises.

13
00:02:59,444 --> 00:02:59,995
So?

14
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:02,942
The advanced class is nonstop.

15
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,311
I lift weights every morning for sixty minutes

16
00:03:07,324 --> 00:03:08,080
without stopping.

17
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:10,022
No problem.

18
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,697
Listen, Richard,

19
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,471
doing aerobics for an hour is a lot different than lifting weights.

20
00:03:18,524 --> 00:03:20,404
Yeah. Quite a bit different.

21
00:03:20,537 --> 00:03:22,308
I think aerobics is easy.

22
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,284
I could work out in your class with no problem.

23
00:03:27,954 --> 00:03:29,142
You think so?

24
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,970
Oh, without a doubt.

25
00:03:31,382 --> 00:03:32,960
When's the next class?

26
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:38,194
Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock. Try it.

27
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,062
Tomorrow morning after lifting weights,

28
00:03:43,142 --> 00:03:44,170
I'll try aerobics.

29
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,788
It's a snap. Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.

30
00:04:03,222 --> 00:04:05,954
Aren't you going to the aerobics class this morning?

31
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,600
Of course.

32
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:13,428
Easy. No sweat.

33
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:20,114
You are not going to be able to move after this and the aerobics class.

34
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:21,885
Are you kidding me?

35
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,365
It's going to be a piece of cake.

36
00:04:26,102 --> 00:04:28,765
You want to bet?

37
00:04:31,142 --> 00:04:33,245
Yeah. What's the bet?

38
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:37,348
I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning

39
00:04:37,405 --> 00:04:39,085
and not feel a thing!

40
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:48,331
The bet is, I win, and you cook dinner for the entire family.

41
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:52,057
Or you win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

42
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:54,091
It's a bet.

43
00:04:54,217 --> 00:04:58,240
OK. Call my instructor, Jack Davis, right now.

44
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:01,440
His number is 555-8842.

45
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:04,102
The advanced class starts at 10 o'clock.

46
00:05:04,182 --> 00:05:05,302
Well, it's 8:20 now.

47
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:08,422
It only takes eight minutes by bicycle to the aerobics class.

48
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,411
Give him a call.

49
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,182
Davis Aerobics Center for Good Health.

50
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,280
Jack Davis, please.

51
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:26,320
This is Jack Davis.

52
00:05:26,377 --> 00:05:28,228
Hello. This is Richard Stewart.

53
00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:31,040
My wife, Marilyn Stewart, is a member of your program.

54
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,708
I'd like to come to the ten o'clock advanced class this morning.

55
00:05:34,857 --> 00:05:37,885
Oh, fine, fine. Be here a few minutes early.

56
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,640
You need to complete some forms before the class.

57
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,320
Thanks. I'm on my way over.

58
00:05:42,697 --> 00:05:43,177
Good-bye.

59
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,657
Bye-bye.

60
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:51,760
It's all set. I'm going.

61
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,497
Bye.

62
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:54,600
See you later.

63
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:56,102
Good luck.

64
00:05:57,085 --> 00:05:59,211
Don't forget about the bet.

65
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,120
Dinner for the entire family.

66
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:02,594
And that includes Susan.

67
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,137
Don't you forget.

68
00:09:21,577 --> 00:09:23,600
OK, Richard. That's terrific.

69
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:27,817
Your pressure is 120 over 75, and that's fine.

70
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,360
Now stand up, please.

71
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:43,645
Good, it's 122 over 80.

72
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:45,622
You can sit down now.

73
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,491
When was your last complete physical?

74
00:09:50,697 --> 00:09:52,857
Six months ago.

75
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:55,280
Good. Do you have any back or knee problems?

76
00:09:55,348 --> 00:09:57,942
Nope. I am in perfect health.

77
00:09:58,011 --> 00:09:59,600
What do you do for a living, Mr. Stewart?

78
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:00,925
I'm a photographer.

79
00:10:01,074 --> 00:10:03,234
Interesting. What do you photograph?

80
00:10:04,685 --> 00:10:09,142
Everything. The American scene. People, places, events.

81
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:12,434
Did you ever think of photographing an aerobics class?

82
00:10:13,485 --> 00:10:18,160
No. I can't remember taking pictures of people exercising.

83
00:10:18,605 --> 00:10:20,457
But don't you think it'd be a good subject?

84
00:10:20,502 --> 00:10:21,862
Sure.

85
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:27,257
I need some good photos for my advertising, Mr. Stewart.

86
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,800
Maybe you can photogragh a class,

87
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:32,217
and I can give you and Mrs. Stewart a month of classes free.

88
00:10:32,262 --> 00:10:33,942
When can I photograph a class?

89
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,040
Anytime.

90
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:36,937
How about today?

91
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,022
Terrific!

92
00:10:39,657 --> 00:10:40,822
Hi.

93
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:44,125
Oh, hi.

94
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:44,937
Are we ready to go?

95
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:44,971
Yeah, yeah. Let's get in our lines.
Are we ready to go?

96
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:47,051
Yeah, yeah. Let's get in our lines.

97
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:50,000
We're going to take it slow first.

98
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:52,697
Stretch up... and we're going to go left first...

99
00:10:52,697 --> 00:11:01,577
2, 3, 4... Now switch.

100
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,480
OK, hold to the right.

101
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:14,811
Sunrises. Stretch it out. Flat back.

102
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:25,968
Bring it up... and twists... and side... 2, 3...

103
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:38,868
and left... push... push... turn... hit the floor.

104
00:11:38,937 --> 00:11:53,860
Take it side again... OK, and switch. Stretch it out.

105
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:57,211
And we're going to warm down with a tango.

106
00:11:57,314 --> 00:12:02,708
Left, right. Enjoy it.

107
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:18,274
Richard, did you go to the Davis Aerobics class today?

108
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,680
Yes, I went to the aerobics class today.

109
00:12:23,257 --> 00:12:25,165
What is wrong with you?

110
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,982
Nothing. I am in excellent health.

111
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:32,125
I have ideal blood pressure. A perfect heart.

112
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:36,194
In other words, I'm in wonderful condition.

113
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:40,194
Richard, did you go to the aerobics class, really?

114
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:42,468
And don't forget to invite Susan for dinner.

115
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:45,988
And your legs don't hurt?

116
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:48,582
Hurt? What do you mean?

117
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,994
What about your arms? Lift your arms up like this.

118
00:12:54,091 --> 00:12:57,565
And they don't hurt not even a little?

119
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,520
Nope.

120
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,285
You are in great condition. I can't believe it!

121
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:58,902
Grandpa, Ellen, Philip, Robbie, you and me.

122
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:00,754
That's six steaks.

123
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:05,862
Don't forget Susan.

124
00:16:06,937 --> 00:16:08,320
Seven steaks.

125
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:13,508
Cooking dinner for the entire family is not so easy.

126
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,394
The shopping:

127
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:22,034
The salad: tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, and onions.

128
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,560
The main course: steak and potatoes.

129
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:33,074
Richard, how much broccoli do I need for seven people?

130
00:16:34,205 --> 00:16:36,960
Marilyn, I have to tell you something.

131
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,011
At today's exercise class...

132
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,737
Yes, Richard.

133
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:48,928
Well, I didn't really exercise.

134
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,028
I knew it!

135
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:54,457
I wanted to, but Jack Davis needed a photographer.

136
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:56,354
I'm sorry, Marilyn.

137
00:16:57,005 --> 00:16:59,428
I don't understand. Did you exercise or not?

138
00:16:59,474 --> 00:17:02,160
No. Instead of exercising, I photographed the class.

139
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:03,622
And you didn't exercise?

140
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:05,805
No.

141
00:17:08,982 --> 00:17:13,725
There's another advanced class today at four o'clock.

142
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,451
We'll go together.

143
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:17,131
What about the bet?

144
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,371
Oh, the bet is still on, but you shop for the groceries.

145
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:30,857
Remember, you win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

146
00:17:31,074 --> 00:17:35,040
You win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

147
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,685
Including Susan.

148
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,971
Four o'clock at the advanced exercise class. With me.

149
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:54,880
Don't forget to breathe.

150
00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:56,640
Skip, hop, front.

151
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:10,834
Twist... again... OK, now... scissors.

152
00:18:15,748 --> 00:18:18,731
This is fun. It's a piece of cake.

153
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,080
Yeah. Just wait.

154
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:28,880
5, 6, 7, go right, 1, 2, back,

155
00:18:28,937 --> 00:18:34,185
2, 3 , 1, 2, 3, pony, pony...

156
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,860
1, 2, 3, kick... 1, 2, 3, kick... pony.

157
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:43,588
And twist, twist.

158
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:44,045
OK. Let's pick up the pace.
And twist, twist.

159
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:45,382
OK. Let's pick up the pace.

160
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,805
How are you doing, Richard?

161
00:18:48,514 --> 00:18:50,148
I can barely move.

162
00:18:57,977 --> 00:19:03,142
2, 3, 4, front. Now we're going to run it off.

163
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,280
Front... knees up, knees up.

164
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,965
OK. Finish off by jogging in place.
Front... knees up, knees up.

165
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:07,577
OK. Finish off by jogging in place.

166
00:19:09,154 --> 00:19:11,005
OK. Keep those knees up.

167
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:12,742
All right. That's it for today.

168
00:19:13,371 --> 00:19:15,611
Thank you, everyone. See you next week.

169
00:19:16,514 --> 00:19:18,091
Thank you, Jack, but no thank you.

170
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,131
The advanced exercise class is not so easy, huh?

171
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:29,817
No, no, you were right. I was wrong.

172
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:35,531
Come on, Richard. Get up. Let's go.

173
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:38,742
You have to cook dinner for the entire family.

174
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,617
Marilyn, I'm exhausted. I can't move.

175
00:19:42,971 --> 00:19:46,880
Oh, you'll do it. It's a piece of cake.

176
00:19:47,177 --> 00:19:49,874
Excuse me, Richard, Marilyn.

177
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:52,720
You are a terrific instructor, Jack.

178
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:55,817
Thanks. But I have a question.

179
00:19:56,148 --> 00:19:58,651
Is this your very first advanced aerobics class?

180
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:01,348
Yes, it is.

181
00:20:01,645 --> 00:20:03,862
You are in great shape, Richard.

182
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:06,080
Very few people last in this class

183
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:07,577
for the full hour the very first time.

184
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:13,280
It's true. You are in great shape.

185
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:15,611
Thanks!

186
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:19,245
I think we'll cook dinner together.
