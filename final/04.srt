Episode 04 - A Piece of Cake

3
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
I am exhausted. My new exercise class is so hard.

4
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Your new exercise class?

5
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Yeah. My new advanced exercise class.

6
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Why advanced?

7
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,600
My instructor thought that

8
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
the beginner's class was too easy for me.

9
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Too easy for you?

10
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Don't laugh. In the beginner's class,

11
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
they give you a chance to rest between exercises.

12
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
So?

13
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,600
The advanced class is nonstop.

14
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,600
I lift weights every morning for sixty minutes

15
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
without stopping.

16
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
No problem.

17
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Listen, Richard,

18
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,600
doing aerobics for an hour is a lot different than lifting weights.

19
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Yeah. Quite a bit different.

20
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
I think aerobics is easy.

21
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,600
I could work out in your class with no problem.

22
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,600
You think so?

23
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Oh, without a doubt.

24
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
When's the next class?

25
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock. Try it.

26
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Tomorrow morning after lifting weights,

27
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
I'll try aerobics.

28
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,600
It's a nap. Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.

29
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Aren't you going to the aerobics class this morning?

30
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Of Course. Easy. No sweat.

31
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,600
You are not going to be able to move

32
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
after this and the aerobics class.

33
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Are you kidding me?

34
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,600
It's going to be a piece of cake.

35
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,600
You want to bet?

36
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Yeah. What's the bet?

37
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,600
I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning

38
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
and not feel a thing!

39
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:33,600
The bet is -- I win, and you cook dinner for the entire family.

40
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Or you win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

41
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
It's a bet.

42
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Ok. Call my instructor, Jack Davis, right now.

43
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,600
His number is 555-8842.

44
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
The advanced class starts at ten o'clock.

45
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Well, it's eight twenty now.

46
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,600
It only takes eight minutes by bicycle to the aerobics class.

47
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Give him a call.

48
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Davis Aerobics Center for Good Health. Davis

49
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Jack Davis, please.

50
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
This is Jack Davis.

51
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Hello. This is Richard Stewart.

52
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,600
My wife, Marilyn Stewart, is a member of your program.

53
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
I'd like to come to

54
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
the ten o'clock advanced class this morning.

55
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Oh, fine, fine. Be here a few minutes early.

56
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
You need to complete some forms before the class.

57
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Thanks. I'm on my way over.

58
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Good-bye.

59
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Bye-bye. It's all set. I'm going.

60
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Bye.

61
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Bye.

62
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
See you later.

63
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Good luck.

64
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Don't forget about the bet.

65
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Dinner for the entire family.

66
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
And that includes Susan.

67
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Don't you forget.

68
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,100
OK, Richard. That's terrific.

69
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Your pressure is 120 over 75, and that's fine.

70
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Now stand up, please.

71
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:35,100
Good, it's 122 over 80.

72
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,100
You can sit down now.

73
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,100
When was your last complete physical?

74
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Six months ago.

75
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,100
Good. Do you have any back or knee problems?

76
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,100
Nope. I am in perfect health.

77
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,100
What do you do for a living, Mr. Stewart?

78
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,100
I'm a photographer.

79
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,100
Interesting. What do you photograph?

80
00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:00,100
Everything. The American scene. People, places, events.

81
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,100
Did you ever think of photographing an aerobics class?

82
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:09,100
No...I can't remember taking pictures of people exercising.

83
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,100
But don't you think it'd be a good subject?

84
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Sure.

85
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,100
I need some good photos for my advertising, Mr. Stewart.

86
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Maybe you can photogragh a class,

87
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
and I can give you and Mrs. Stewart

88
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,100
a month of classes ree.

89
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
When can I photograph a class?

90
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,100
Anytime.

91
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
How about today?

92
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,100
Terrific!

93
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Hi.

94
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
Oh, hi.

95
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,100
Oh, hi.

96
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Are we ready to go?

97
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,100
Yeah. Yeah. Let's get in our lines.

98
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,100
We're going to take it slow first.

99
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Stretch up...and we're going to go left first ...

100
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:58,100
2,3,4 ... now switch. ... 2 3 4

101
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,100
OK, hold to the right.

102
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Sunrises. Stretch it out. Flat back.

103
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Bring it up ... and twists ... and side ... 2, 3 ...

104
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:31,100
and left ... push ... push ... turn ... hit the floor.

105
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Take it side again .... OK, and switch. Stretch it out.

106
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,100
And we're going to warm down with a tango.

107
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Left, right. Enjoy it.

108
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:09,100
Richard, did you go to the Davis Aerobics class today? Richard

109
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Yes, I went to the aerobics class today.

110
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,100
What is wrong with you?

111
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Nothing. I am in excellent health.

112
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,100
I have ideal blood pressure. A perfect heart.

113
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,100
In other words, I'm in wonderful condition.

114
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Richard, did you go to the aerobics class, really? Richard

115
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
And don't forget to invite Susan for dinner.

116
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,100
And your legs don't hurt?

117
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,100
Hurt? What do you mean?

118
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,100
What about your arms? Lift your arms up like this.

119
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,100
And they don't hurt not even a little?

120
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
Nope.

121
00:12:50,100 --> 00:13:00,100
You are in great condition. I can't believe it!

122
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Grandpa, Ellen, Philip, Robbie, you and me.

123
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,100
That's six steaks.

124
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,100
Don't forget Susan.

125
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,100
Seven steaks.

126
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,100
Cooking dinner for the entire family is not so easy.

127
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,100
The shopping: the salad:

128
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:20,100
tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, and onions.

129
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:26,100
The main course: steak and potatoes.

130
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,100
Richard, how much broccoli do I need for seven people? Richard

131
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,100
Marilyn, I have to tell you something. Marilyn

132
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,100
At today's exercise class...

133
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
Yes, Richard.

134
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:46,100
Well, I didn't really exercise.

135
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
I knew it!

136
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,100
I wanted to, but Jack Davis needed a photographer.

137
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
I'm sorry, Marilyn.

138
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,100
I don't understand. Did you exercise or not?

139
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,100
No. Instead of exercising, I photographed the class.

140
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,100
And you didn't exercise?

141
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,100
No.

142
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:11,100
There's another advanced class today at four o'clock.

143
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,100
We'll go together.

144
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,100
What about the bet?

145
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:21,100
Oh, the bet is still on, but you shop for the groceries.

146
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:28,100
Remember, you win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

147
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,100
You win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

148
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Including Susan.

149
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Four o'clock at the advanced exercise class. With me.

150
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Don't forget to breathe.

151
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,100
Skip, hop, front.

152
00:16:53,100 --> 00:17:08,100
Twist... again.... OK, now... scissors.

153
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:16,100
This is fun. It's a piece of cake.

154
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,100
Yeah. Just wait.

155
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:27,100
5, 6, 7, go right, 1, 2, back, 5 6 7

156
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,100
2, 3 , 1, 2, 3, pony, pony... 2 3 1 2 33

157
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:37,100
1, 2, 3, kick... 1, 2, 3, kick... pony. 1 2 3

158
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:43,100
And twist, twist.

159
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
OK. Let's pick up the pace.

160
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
How are you doing, Richard?

161
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,100
I can barely move.

162
00:17:47,100 --> 00:18:01,100
2, 3, 4, front. Now we're going to run it off. 2 3 4

163
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Front... knees up, knees up.

164
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,100
OK. Finish off by jogging in place.

165
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,100
OK. Keep those knees up.

166
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,100
All right. That's it for today.

167
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,100
Thank you, everyone. See you next week.

168
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,100
Thank you, Jack, but no thank you.

169
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,100
The advanced exercise class is not so easy, huh?

170
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:27,100
No, no, you were right. I was wrong.

171
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:33,100
Come on, Richard. Get up. Let's go.

172
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,100
You have to cook dinner for the entire family.

173
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,100
Marilyn, I'm exhausted. I can't move. Marilyn

174
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,100
Oh, you'll do it. It's a piece of cake.

175
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,100
Excuse me, Richard, Marilyn.

176
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,100
You are a terrific instructor, Jack.

177
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Thanks. But I have a question.

178
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,100
Is this your very first advanced aerobics class?

179
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,100
Yes, it is.

180

You are in great shape, Richard.

181
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Very few people last in this class

182
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,100
for the full hour the very first time.

183
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,100
It's true. You are in great shape.

184
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
Thanks!

185
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:18,100
I think we'll cook dinner together.
