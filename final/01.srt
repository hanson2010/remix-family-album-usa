Episode 01 - 46 Linden Street

3
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:18,000
Excuse me.

4
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:20,133
My name is Richard Stewart.

5
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,244
I'm a photographer.

6
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,137
May I take a picture of you and your little boy?

7
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,035
What's it for?

8
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,906
It's for a book.

9
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,062
You're writing a book?

10
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,044
It's a book of pictures.

11
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,928
I call it Family Album, U.S.A.

12
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,911
Oh, that's a nice idea.

13
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,768
Well, it's fine if you take our picture.

14
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,200
I'm Martha Vann.

15
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,511
Thank you. I appreciate your help.

16
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:40,435
I'm Richard. What's your name?

17
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,315
Gerald.

18
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,604
How old are you, Gerald?

19
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,368
Five.

20
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,533
And where do you live?

21
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,204
We live in California.

22
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,560
Well, welcome to New York.

23
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,044
OK, just a second.

24
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:54,773
I'm almost ready here.

25
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,391
Can I help you?

26
00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:58,600
Oh, please.

27
00:03:03,946 --> 00:03:06,373
Hold Gerald's hand, please.

28
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:10,168
Great!

29
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:12,604
Now point to the buildings.

30
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:16,613
Terrific!

31
00:03:18,773 --> 00:03:21,528
Give Mommy a kiss, Gerald.

32
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:24,666
Nice!

33
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:27,502
Thank you, Gerald.

34
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,848
And thank you, Mrs. Vann.

35
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,164
Oh, my pleasure.

36
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,595
We'll be looking for your book.

37
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,080
Thank you. Good-bye. Bye, Gerald.

38
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:39,991
Thanks again.

39
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,195
Oh, you're welcome.

40
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:44,097
Hey, let me take your picture!

41
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,533
Wonderful. Please.

42
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:53,964
Are you from New York?

43
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,582
No, I'm from Greece.

44
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:57,600
I'm an exchange student.

45
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,555
When did you come here?

46
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,280
Three months ago.

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,377
Your English is very good.

48
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,604
Thanks.

49
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,933
I studied English in school.

50
00:04:10,746 --> 00:04:12,515
Would you like some coffee?

51
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,964
No, thank you.

52
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,497
Tell me about your book.

53
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,577
Oh, it's not finished yet,

54
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,320
but I have some of the pictures.

55
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,288
Would you like to see them?

56
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,942
Yes. I'd like that.

57
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,204
Here they are.

58
00:04:26,755 --> 00:04:29,297
Family Album, U.S.A.

59
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,657
It's an album of pictures of the United States:

60
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,671
the cities, the special places, and the people.

61
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,373
And these are pictures of people working:

62
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:47,600
steelworkers, bankers, police, street vendors,

63
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:53,413
ambulance drivers, doctors...

64
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,782
Oh, this is my father. He's a doctor.

65
00:04:58,986 --> 00:05:00,320
This is my mother.

66
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,626
What's her name?

67
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,675
Ellen.

68
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,177
My younger brother, Robbie.

69
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,697
He goes to high school.

70
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:10,266
This is my sister Susan.

71
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,084
She works for a toy company.

72
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,071
Here's my grandfather.

73
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,715
He lives in Florida.

74
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,026
And this is my wife Marilyn.

75
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,555
Oh, she's very pretty.

76
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:24,600
Thanks. And what about your family?

77
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
They are in Thessaloniki.

78
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,213
That's a large city in northern Greece.

79
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,853
But now I'm living in the Bronx.

80
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,977
With a Greek-American family?

81
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,408
No. Hispanic.

82
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,733
Oh no! It's five thirty.

83
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,662
Will you excuse me?

84
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,653
I have to meet my wife.

85
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,288
It was nice meeting you.

86
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,191
It was a pleasure meeting you, too.

87
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,346
Thanks for your help.

88
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,448
And good luck! I've got to go.

89
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,746
By the way, I'm Richard.

90
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,422
What's your name?

91
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,808
Alexandra.

92
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,631
Bye-bye, Alexandra. Thanks.

93
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,600
Bye-bye.

94
00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:06,248
Richard! Richard!

95
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,657
You left your bag!

96
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,697
Excuse me, officer. Can you help me?

97
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:08,444
Sure.

98
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,848
Can you tell me how to get to Linden Street in Riverdale?

99
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,315
Richard Stewart, 46 Linden Street, Riverdale, New York.

100
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,191
You should take the number 1 subway.

101
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,853
Is there a station near here?

102
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,568
Yes. The station's that way.

103
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,075
You should take the number 1 train to Van Cortlandt Park.

104
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,515
Number 1 train to Van Cortlandt Park. Thank you.

105
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:27,502
Anytime. Good luck.

106
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,400
Remember, the number 1 train. The uptown platform.

107
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,680
Thank you.

108
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,328
You're welcome.

109
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,146
Is this pink too bright for me?

110
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,875
Mmm-hmm. It is a very bright pink.

111
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:07,022
Try this. It's size eight.

112
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:08,782
But I wear size ten.

113
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,848
How about green? It's size ten.

114
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,128
Let me try it on.

115
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,693
I'm taking too much of your time.

116
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:23,600
It's six o'clock.

117
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,004
Where's my husband?

118
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,368
I was expecting him here at 5:45.

119
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,760
Don't worry. The traffic is very heavy at this hour.

120
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,493
I know. But we're going to be late for dinner.

121
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,733
I'll take this green sweater.

122
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,075
I like the color on me, don't you?

123
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,066
I think it looks terrific on you.

124
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm sorry I'm so late.

125
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:47,502
I had a really bad day.

126
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,791
It's 6:10. We're late.

127
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,137
Robbie's cooking tonight, and dinner's at 6:30.

128
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,893
I know. I know. I'm really sorry.

129
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,453
I left my bag of film on the ferry.

130
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,640
I went back for it, but the ferry was gone.

131
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,551
I lost a whole day's work.

132
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,537
I'll call the Staten Island Ferry lost-and-found office.

133
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,760
I didn't think of that. Thanks.

134
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:14,862
Hello.

135
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,568
Yes. The number, please,

136
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,617
of the Staten Island Ferry lost-and-found office.

137
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:27,697
555-0808.

138
00:11:27,697 --> 00:11:29,084
Thank you.

139
00:11:30,382 --> 00:11:32,195
I really appreciate it, Marilyn.

140
00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:34,088
Hello.

141
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,733
Did anyone find a camera bag this afternoon,

142
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,204
a small canvas bag,

143
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,164
on the J. F. Kennedy Ferry? No?

144
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:50,302
Maybe someone will find it.

145
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,457
The name is Stewart, Richard Stewart.

146
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:59,226
And the telephone number is 555-3090.

147
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,644
Thank you.

148
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:05,484
Sorry, Richard. They don't have it.

149
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:07,964
Thanks, anyway.

150
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:12,755
There was a girl on the ferry.

151
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:12,760
Now maybe...

152
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,560
Tell me about it on the way home.
Now maybe...

153
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,240
Tell me about it on the way home.

154
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:08,373
And give her a teaspoon of the medicine after every meal.

155
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:11,306
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

156
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,022
You're welcome. Good-bye.

157
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:27,537
How are you?

158
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,008
I'm tired and hungry.

159
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,355
Well, Marilyn and Richard called.

160
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,213
They'll be here soon, and then we'll eat.

161
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,422
All right. Is... is Susan coming?

162
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,031
Well, she'll be here later.

163
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,275
She has to work late tonight.

164
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,408
And what's Robbie cooking for dinner?

165
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:45,333
It's a surprise.

166
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:47,911
I hope it's pasta.

167
00:15:51,724 --> 00:15:54,604
Robbie, the dinner was terrific.

168
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,537
Yes, it was delicious.

169
00:15:58,817 --> 00:16:00,062
What's for dessert?

170
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,355
Oh, I forgot dessert.

171
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,177
Robbie!

172
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,973
Don't worry.

173
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,582
We've got lots of ice cream.

174
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,662
Oh, I'd love some ice cream.

175
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:15,973
Well, there's chocolate and coffee and a little vanilla.

176
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,333
I'll have vanilla.

177
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,746
Is that all right with everyone?

178
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,133
I'll have chocolate.

179
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,253
Me, too.

180
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,764
Uh, one scoop of coffee

181
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,897
and one scoop of chocolate for me.

182
00:16:28,346 --> 00:16:30,817
Robbie, will you help me serve?

183
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:46,346
I keep thinking about that bag of film. Eight rolls.

184
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,400
A whole day's work.

185
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,293
And good stuff, too.

186
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,600
Don't worry, Richard.

187
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,040
Someone will find it.

188
00:16:57,155 --> 00:17:05,182
I'll get it. Hello.

189
00:17:05,182 --> 00:17:06,586
Hello.

190
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,075
Does Richard Stewart live here?

191
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,040
Yes, he's my brother.

192
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,368
I'm Robbie... Robbie Stewart.

193
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,235
I'm Alexandra Pappas.

194
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,604
How do you do?

195
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:20,897
Your brother left his bag of film on the ferryboat.

196
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,928
I found it.

197
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,160
I'm really glad to see you.

198
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,573
I mean... my brother'll be really glad to see you!

199
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,991
Robbie! Who is it?

200
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,831
It's Richard's film!

201
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,111
I mean, Alexandra Pappas.

202
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,164
Come in, please.

203
00:17:42,151 --> 00:17:43,480
Alexandra!

204
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:46,026
Hello, Richard. I found your bag!

205
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,368
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

206
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,706
Um... Alexandra, let me introduce you.

207
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,137
This is my wife Marilyn.

208
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,986
Richard showed me your photo.

209
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,000
How do you do?

210
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,968
Oh yes.

211
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,657
Richard told us all about you.

212
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,875
It's nice to meet you.

213
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,000
And this is my mother, Ellen Stewart.

214
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:02,977
How do you do?

215
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,440
And my father, Dr. Philip Stewart.

216
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,933
Nice to meet you, Alexandra.

217
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,462
And... ah... you met Robbie.

218
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,937
Yes. And you must be Susan. Hi.

219
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,200
Hi. Welcome.

220
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,262
I'm so glad you found the bag

221
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,315
and took the time and trouble to return it.

222
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,862
Oh, it was no trouble.

223
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,217
I just took the wrong train.

224
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,613
Would you like something to eat?

225
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,991
Thank you, no.

226
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,804
I'm late for dinner at my house.

227
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,720
I really have to go.

228
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,960
Would you like to call home?

229
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,551
I'd appreciate that.

230
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,320
Please, use the phone.

231
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,177
Thanks. Excuse me.

232
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,431
Alexandra is a high-school exchange student from Greece.

233
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,817
Where does she live?

234
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,711
With a family in the Bronx.

235
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,755
Oh, that's not too far from here!

236
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,426
Take it easy, Robbie.

237
00:18:45,831 --> 00:18:46,568
Thank you.

238
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,831
I can only stay a few minutes.

239
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,071
Have some iced tea.

240
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,982
Thanks, Mrs. Stewart.

241
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:56,000
Please sit down, Alexandra.

242
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:05,000
So, you're an exchange student.

243
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,853
Where do you go to school?

244
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,413
At the Bronx High School of Science.

245
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,053
Oh, that's a very good school.

246
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,866
What are your favorite subjects?

247
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,266
Biology and mathematics.

248
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,213
Richard tells me you're a doctor.

249
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,284
Yes, a pediatrician.

250
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,106
And what does your father do?

251
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,106
He's a lawyer, in Thessaloniki.

252
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,142
Would you like some pasta?

253
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,502
I made it myself.

254
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,377
It might be a little cold.

255
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,608
Thanks, no. I do have to go.

256
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,733
It was nice meeting you all.

257
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,106
Well, maybe you'll come for lunch some Sunday,

258
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,200
so we can really thank you

259
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,782
for bringing Richard's bag back.

260
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,475
Maybe.

261
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,635
You're welcome anytime.

262
00:19:43,635 --> 00:19:45,000
Good-bye.

263
00:19:50,977 --> 00:19:52,631
Can I drive you home?

264
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,528
No, thanks.

265
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,817
The train is just up the street.

266
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,373
It won't take me long at all.

267
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,164
Well, you really saved the day for me, Alexandra.

268
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,195
Bye.

269
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:00,871
Bye-bye.

270
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,973
Good night.

271
00:20:10,328 --> 00:20:13,920
She's a smart young lady, and very nice.

272
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,786
Very! Hey, she forgot her bag!

273
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,924
I guess we'll be seeing Alexandra again.

274
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,897
Right, Robbie?
