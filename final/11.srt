Episode 11 - A Place of Our Own

3
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Ellen, I'd like your opinion.

4
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
About what?

5
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Well, Richard and I feel that with a baby coming

6
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,600
we need to have our own place to live.

7
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Oh.

8
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Well, what do you think about Richard and me

9
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
looking for a small house or an apartment

10
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
at this point in our lives?

11
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,600
We love having you here,

12
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
and there is room,

13
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
and ... and when the baby comes,

14
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
the baby can stay in your room for a while.

15
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Richard feels we need to find a small house.

16
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:54,600
I remember when I was pregnant with Richard.

17
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Philip and I were living with Grandma and Grandpa.

18
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Philip was a young doctor, Philip

19
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
and he kept talking about having a house of our own.

20
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,600
It's natural.

21
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
What did you do?

22
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,600
We looked at a lot of houses.

23
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Did you find one?

24
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Oh, not at first.

25
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
We couldn't afford it.

26
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Grandpa wanted to lend us the money to buy one,

27
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
but Philip is too independent.

28
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
He didn't want to borrow any money.

29
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Sounds like Richard.

30
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
They're all alike.

31
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Richard is a real Stewart.

32
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,600
He's independent,

33
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,600
and sometimes just stubborn.

34
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,600
When did you buy a house?

35
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
After Richard was born.

36
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
I was teaching music,

37
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,600
and Philip was opening his first medical office.

38
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Where was the house?

39
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Right here in Riverdale.

40
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Of course, it was a small house,

41
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
but just right for us.

42
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,600
It's funny. History repeats itself.

43
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Now Richard and I are having a baby,

44
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
and we probably won't be able to

45
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
afford a house right away, either.

46
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Why don't you look at some houses, Marilyn?

47
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Good idea.

48
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Look in the real-estate section of Sunday's Times.

49
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
You'll learn a lot.

50
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Maybe we should

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
speak to a real-estate agent about a house.

52
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
And a bank about a mortgage.

53
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
I'll talk to Richard about it.

54
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
I think it's a good idea, Ellen.

55
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
We can learn a lot by asking.

56
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
And if I can be of any help,

57
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
let me know.

58
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
As a matter of fact,

59
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
my friend Virginia Martinelli is a real-estate agent.

60
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Good.

61
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
You won't believe this,

62
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
but she sold us our first house and this one.

63
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Well, I'll tell Richard,

64
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
and we'll go to see her.

65
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Do you think the skirt length is right, Ellen?

66
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Do you think it's too long?

67
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,600
I think the skirt is just right.

68
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Are you planning to attach a train to it?

69
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
No. No train. Just the dress.

70
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,600
But I am going to make a headpiece of lace.

71
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,600
That dress is gorgeous.

72
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Thanks, Ellen.

73
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
And thanks for the advice about the house.

74
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
I'll talk to Richard about it

75
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
the minute he comes home.

76
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
And remember,

77
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,600
we love having you here.

78
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,600
There's no need to rush.

79
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,600
I remember your parents' first house very well.

80
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,600
It was on Spring Avenue, near the park.

81
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
I grew up in that house.

82
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,000
Yes, and you were such a cute baby.

83
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I've seen pictures of him.

84
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He had blond hair.

85
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I've been friendly with the Stewart family

86
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
for a long time,

87
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
so it's my pleasure

88
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
to help you find a house now.

89
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Well, we're not sure we can afford one.

90
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
But we'd like to find out

91
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
about the possibilities.

92
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
That's a good idea.

93
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,600
I love your house on Linden Street.

94
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,600
I sold your father that house seventeen years ago.

95
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Really?

96
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Yes, Mom was pregnant with Robbie then,

97
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
and they needed the extra room.

98
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I hear you're expecting a baby, Mrs. Stewart.

99
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Mmm-hmm.

100
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
So we will be needing more room.

101
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Oh, so you don't need something immediately?

102
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,600
No. But in five or six months...

103
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
And time passes so quickly.

104
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Yes, it does.

105
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Well, when you called,

106
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
you gave me enough information

107
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
about your salaries and your savings.

108
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
So I have a good idea about your financial situation.

109
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Let me show you some pictures of houses.

110
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
With two bedrooms?

111
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Yes, I think I can show you some.

112
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Of course, they won't be in Riverdale.

113
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
The cost of housing's too high for you here.

114
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,600
I haven't thought about living anywhere else.

115
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,600
We've always lived in this area.

116
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Where should we look for a house, Mrs. Martinelli?

117
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Well, we have an office in Mount Kisco.

118
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
It's a lovely area,

119
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
and it's only about an hour's drive from here.

120
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Here.

121
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,600
I have a book with photos of some homes in that area.

122
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Now, let's see.

123
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Here

124
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,600
This is a lovely two-bedroom house in your price range.

125
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,600
It's pretty,

126
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
but I prefer a two-story home.

127
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
I do, too.

128
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
I don't care for a ranch type.

129
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
OK.

130
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Oh, this is a wonderful house.

131
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
I know it well.

132
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
I sold it to the present owners.

133
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
It looks wonderful.

134
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,600
This is a two-bedroom, two-bath house.

135
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
It has a full basement,

136
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
and it is on a half-acre lot.

137
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
You can probably afford this one.

138
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I like this house.

139
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
So do I.

140
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
And the price is right.

141
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Would you like to go see it?

142
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Yes. We're planning

143
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
to talk to someone at the bank next week.

144
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Perhaps we could see the house this weekend.

145
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,600
If someone doesn't buy it before then,

146
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,600
But let's keep looking.

147
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Just to get an idea of some other possibilities.

148
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
This is very helpful, Mrs. Martinelli.

149
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Here.

150
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,600
This is a wonderful example of Spanish-style architecture.

151
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,600
I love the roof tiles on a Spanish-style house.

152
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,600
It looks like the houses in Hollywood.

153
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
It's interesting.

154
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,600
A house like this in Riverdale costs double the price.

155
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Oh my!

156
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Here's a real buy.

157
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
It's a bargain.

158
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
This house just came on the market.

159
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
It's quite lovely.

160
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Is it a two-bedroom house?

161
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,600
No. It has three bedrooms and three baths.

162
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
I know the house.

163
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
It has a brand new kitchen.

164
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
And a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling.

165
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,600
And there's a two-car garage.

166
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Then why don't we go look at this house, too?

167
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
It's a good investment.

168
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Thank you, Mrs. Martinelli.

169
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Thanks so much.

170
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
My pleasure.

171
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Give my best to your parents.

172
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Your father's a wonderful doctor, Richard.

173
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
He took care of my daughter

174
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
when she was a child.

175
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
He's the best pediatrician in Westchester.

176
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Thanks, Mrs. Martinelli.

177
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
I'll give them your regards.

178
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
We really appreciate your advice.

179
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I do think you should go see the houses

180
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
and talk to the bank.

181
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Here.

182
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Let me give you some information sheets about the houses.

183
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,600
They're both very good buys.

184
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Well, thanks so much for your help and your time,

185
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Mrs. Martinelli.

186
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
We've got a lot to talk about.

187
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Mmm-hmm. Thanks.

188
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,600
How do you do?

189
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Hello.

190
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
I'm Ralph Riley.

191
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,600
I'm Richard Stewart, and this is my wife, Marilyn.

192
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Pleased to meet you.

193
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Likewise, Mr. Riley.

194
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Please, sit down. What can I do for you?

195
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
We'd like to discuss a mortgage.

196
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
For a house.

197
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Fine. Are you buying a house

198
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
or are you refinancing your present home?

199
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
We're planning to buy a house.

200
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,600
And we'd like to find out about a mortgage.

201
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
We are customers of the bank.

202
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,600
As a matter of fact, my whole family banks here.

203
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
I have some questions to ask.

204
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Do you own your house or do you rent?

205
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Neither.

206
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,600
We live with my parents, Dr. and Mrs. Philip Stewart.

207
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,600
And how old are you?

208
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
I'm twenty-nine.

209
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
I'm thirty.

210
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,600
And, Mr. Stewart, what is your occupation?

211
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
I'm a freelance photographer.

212
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
And, Mrs. Stewart, are you working?

213
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Yes. I'm a designer, and I work in a boutique.

214
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Did you bring any savings or salary information?

215
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Last year's tax forms?

216
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Yes. Here they are.

217
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:38,600
OK. What... what kind of house did you have in mind?

218
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
We're talking about buying

219
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
a two-bedroom house in Mount Kisco.

220
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Here are the financial details on the house.

221
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Thank you.

222
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Are you prepared to make a ten-percent down payment?

223
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Yes, we are.

224
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Payments over thirty years?

225
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Yes.

226
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Do you think we can get a loan?

227
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Well, it depends. Do you own any other property?

228
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Any stocks or bonds?

229
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,600
No.

230
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,600
I see. Then you don't have any collateral.

231
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Perhaps you could get a guarantor -

232
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,600
someone to sign for the loan for you.

233
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Why is that necessary?

234
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Since you don't have enough income,

235
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
and you don't already own any property,

236
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
the bank needs to be sure

237
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
you can pay the mortgage every month.

238
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,600
A guarantor is responsible for the loan

239
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
if you can't make the payments.

240
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:39,600
I see. Well, the idea of buying a house is exciting.

241
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Thank you, Mr. Riley. We'll read this over carefully.

242
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Thank you.

243
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Good-bye. Thanks.

244
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Good-bye. And hope to see you soon.

245
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
I hope so, too.

246
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Take care.

247
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Good-bye.

248
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:12,200
It all sounded so easy

249
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,600
until they mentioned needing collateral or a guarantor.

250
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,600
We have no collateral.

251
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,600
And I don't think it's a good idea

252
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
to ask Dad to sign as a guarantor.

253
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
I don't feel right about it.

254
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
I understand your feelings about it, Richard.

255
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Now, tell me, what's the problem?

256
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,600
We can get a loan from the bank

257
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
if we can put up some collateral.

258
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,600
And we don't own anything to use as collateral.

259
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Or someone can sign with us as a guarantor.

260
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Why don't you speak to Dad?

261
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,600
No. If we buy a house, I want to be able to handle it alone.

262
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Everybody needs help sometimes, Richard.

263
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,600
I understand Richard's feelings about it, Ellen.

264
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,600
In two or three months, I'll have an advance on my book

265
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
and be able to put more money down.

266
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
What about the house in Mount Kisco?

267
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Somebody else'll buy it by then.

268
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Then there'll be other houses, Marilyn.

269
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Richard has a point. You're just beginning to look.

270
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
We're in no great rush. It's true.

271
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
This has been a great learning experience for us, Marilyn.

272
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Talking to the real-estate agent.

273
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Looking at the houses.

274
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Talking to the loan officer at the bank.

275
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,600
It has been a learning experience. That's true.

276
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,600
I think you're doing the right thing. Taking your time.

277
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Looking around. Especially with a purchase of this kind.

278
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
You're talking about a lot of money.

279
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,600
We'll call Mrs. Martinelli and tell her to keep looking for us.

280
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
And I'll call Mr. Riley at the bank

281
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,600
and tell him we'll see him in a couple of months.

282
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,600
And if you ever need Dad or me to help you ...

283
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
We know.

284
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,600
You know we'll be there for you.

285
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,600
It's a Stewart tradition. We're a family.
