Episode 11 - A Place of Our Own

3
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,360
Ellen, I'd like your opinion.

4
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,500
About what?

5
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,320
Well, Richard and I feel that with a baby coming

6
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,960
we need to have our own place to live.

7
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,800
Oh.

8
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,040
Well, what do you think about Richard and me

9
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,460
looking for a small house or an apartment

10
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,900
at this point in our lives?

11
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,160
We love having you here,

12
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,460
and there is room,

13
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,420
and... and when the baby comes,

14
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,060
the baby can stay in your room for a while.

15
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,100
Richard feels we need to find a small house.

16
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,900
I remember when I was pregnant with Richard.

17
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,080
Philip and I were living with Grandma and Grandpa.

18
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,760
Philip was a young doctor,

19
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,800
and he kept talking about having a house of our own.

20
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,200
It's natural.

21
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,780
What did you do?

22
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,440
We looked at a lot of houses.

23
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,660
Did you find one?

24
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,540
Oh, not at first.

25
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,000
We couldn't afford it.

26
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,100
Grandpa wanted to lend us the money to buy one,

27
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,400
but Philip is too independent.

28
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,640
He didn't want to borrow any money.

29
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,860
Sounds like Richard.

30
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,960
They're all alike.

31
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,340
Richard is a real Stewart.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,440
He's independent,

33
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,460
and sometimes just stubborn.

34
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,980
When did you buy a house?

35
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,240
After Richard was born.

36
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,400
I was teaching music,

37
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,040
and Philip was opening his first medical office.

38
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,000
Where was the house?

39
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,020
Right here in Riverdale.

40
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,760
Of course, it was a small house,

41
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,080
but just right for us.

42
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,200
It's funny. History repeats itself.

43
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,140
Now Richard and I are having a baby,

44
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,440
and we probably won't be able to

45
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,340
afford a house right away, either.

46
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,540
Why don't you look at some houses, Marilyn?

47
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,540
Good idea.

48
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,100
Look in the real-estate section of Sunday's Times.

49
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,660
You'll learn a lot.

50
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,480
Maybe we should

51
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,440
speak to a real-estate agent about a house.

52
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,480
And a bank about a mortgage.

53
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,920
I'll talk to Richard about it.

54
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,200
I think it's a good idea, Ellen.

55
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,000
We can learn a lot by asking.

56
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,400
And if I can be of any help,

57
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,140
let me know.

58
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,360
As a matter of fact,

59
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,660
my friend Virginia Martinelli is a real-estate agent.

60
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,420
Good.

61
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,100
You won't believe this,

62
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,040
but she sold us our first house and this one.

63
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,540
Well, I'll tell Richard,

64
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,960
and we'll go to see her.

65
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,040
Do you think the skirt length is right, Ellen?

66
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,020
Do you think it's too long?

67
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,940
I think the skirt is just right.

68
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,140
Are you planning to attach a train to it?

69
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,600
No. No train. Just the dress.

70
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,440
But I am going to make a headpiece of lace.

71
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,460
That dress is gorgeous.

72
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,220
Thanks, Ellen.

73
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,460
And thanks for the advice about the house.

74
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,680
I'll talk to Richard about it

75
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,940
the minute he comes home.

76
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,660
And remember,

77
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,740
we love having you here.

78
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,440
There's no need to rush.

79
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,600
I remember your parents' first house very well.

80
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,040
It was on Spring Avenue, near the park.

81
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,340
I grew up in that house.

82
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,720
Yes, and you were such a cute baby.

83
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,200
I've seen pictures of him.

84
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,980
He had blond hair.

85
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,500
I've been friendly with the Stewart family

86
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,280
for a long time,

87
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,060
so it's my pleasure

88
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,640
to help you find a house now.

89
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,740
Well, we're not sure we can afford one.

90
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,040
But we'd like to find out

91
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,060
about the possibilities.

92
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,500
That's a good idea.

93
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,940
I love your house on Linden Street.

94
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,240
I sold your father that house seventeen years ago.

95
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:08,760
Really?

96
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,860
Yes, Mom was pregnant with Robbie then,

97
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,240
and they needed the extra room.

98
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,940
I hear you're expecting a baby, Mrs. Stewart.

99
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,380
Mmm-hmm.

100
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,620
So we will be needing more room.

101
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,540
Oh, so you don't need something immediately?

102
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,940
No. But in five or six months...

103
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,940
And time passes so quickly.

104
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,520
Yes, it does.

105
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,340
Well, when you called,

106
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,560
you gave me enough information

107
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,460
about your salaries and your savings.

108
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,540
So I have a good idea about your financial situation.

109
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,840
Let me show you some pictures of houses.

110
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,140
With two bedrooms?

111
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,920
Yes, I think I can show you some.

112
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,860
Of course, they won't be in Riverdale.

113
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,660
The cost of housing's too high for you here.

114
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,660
I haven't thought about living anywhere else.

115
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
We've always lived in this area.

116
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,000
Where should we look for a house, Mrs. Martinelli?

117
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,160
Well, we have an office in Mount Kisco.

118
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,340
It's a lovely area,

119
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,620
and it's only about an hour's drive from here.

120
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,340
Here.

121
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,700
I have a book with photos of some homes in that area.

122
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,540
Now, let's see.

123
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,600
Here.

124
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,900
This is a lovely two-bedroom house in your price range.

125
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,500
It's pretty,

126
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,760
but I prefer a two-story home.

127
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,720
I do, too.

128
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,680
I don't care for a ranch type.

129
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,940
OK.

130
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,960
Oh, this is a wonderful house.

131
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
I know it well.

132
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,600
I sold it to the present owners.

133
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,840
It looks wonderful.

134
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,640
This is a two-bedroom, two-bath house.

135
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,260
It has a full basement,

136
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,360
and it is on a half-acre lot.

137
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,420
You can probably afford this one.

138
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,500
I like this house.

139
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,440
So do I.

140
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,140
And the price is right.

141
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,640
Would you like to go see it?

142
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,140
Yes. We're planning

143
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,160
to talk to someone at the bank next week.

144
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,140
Perhaps we could see the house this weekend.

145
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,900
If someone doesn't buy it before then,

146
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,900
But let's keep looking.

147
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,900
Just to get an idea of some other possibilities.

148
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,360
This is very helpful, Mrs. Martinelli.

149
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,660
Here.

150
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,160
This is a wonderful example of Spanish-style architecture.

151
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,560
I love the roof tiles on a Spanish-style house.

152
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,220
It looks like the houses in Hollywood.

153
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,560
It's interesting.

154
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,940
A house like this in Riverdale costs double the price.

155
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,260
Oh my!

156
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,640
Here's a real buy.

157
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,560
It's a bargain.

158
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,020
This house just came on the market.

159
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,100
It's quite lovely.

160
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,760
Is it a two-bedroom house?

161
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,700
No. It has three bedrooms and three baths.

162
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,000
I know the house.

163
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,660
It has a brand new kitchen.

164
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,700
And a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling.

165
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,740
And there's a two-car garage.

166
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,720
Then why don't we go look at this house, too?

167
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,680
It's a good investment.

168
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,560
Thank you, Mrs. Martinelli.

169
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,440
Thanks so much.

170
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,440
My pleasure.

171
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,100
Give my best to your parents.

172
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,700
Your father's a wonderful doctor, Richard.

173
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,000
He took care of my daughter

174
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,240
when she was a child.

175
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,800
He's the best pediatrician in Westchester.

176
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,940
Thanks, Mrs. Martinelli.

177
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,000
I'll give them your regards.

178
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,940
We really appreciate your advice.

179
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,640
I do think you should go see the houses

180
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,000
and talk to the bank.

181
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,600
Here.

182
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,680
Let me give you some information sheets about the houses.

183
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,240
They're both very good buys.

184
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,340
Well, thanks so much for your help and your time,

185
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,260
Mrs. Martinelli.

186
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,600
We've got a lot to talk about.

187
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,780
Mmm-hmm. Thanks.

188
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,680
How do you do?

189
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,140
Hello.

190
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,080
I'm Ralph Riley.

191
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,800
I'm Richard Stewart, and this is my wife, Marilyn.

192
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,460
Pleased to meet you.

193
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,760
Likewise, Mr. Riley.

194
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,780
Please, sit down. What can I do for you?

195
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,660
We'd like to discuss a mortgage.

196
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,740
For a house.

197
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,960
Fine. Are you buying a house

198
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,820
or are you refinancing your present home?

199
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,480
We're planning to buy a house.

200
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,080
And we'd like to find out about a mortgage.

201
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,960
We are customers of the bank.

202
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,520
As a matter of fact, my whole family banks here.

203
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,800
I have some questions to ask.

204
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,460
Do you own your house or do you rent?

205
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,860
Neither.

206
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,420
We live with my parents, Dr. and Mrs. Philip Stewart.

207
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,860
And how old are you?

208
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,940
I'm 29.

209
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,080
I'm 30.

210
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,280
And, Mr. Stewart, what is your occupation?

211
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,080
I'm a freelance photographer.

212
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,740
And, Mrs. Stewart, are you working?

213
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,400
Yes. I'm a designer, and I work in a boutique.

214
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,160
Did you bring any savings or salary information?

215
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,500
Last year's tax forms?

216
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,920
Yes. Here they are.

217
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,140
OK. What... what kind of house did you have in mind?

218
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,640
We're talking about buying

219
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,560
a two-bedroom house in Mount Kisco.

220
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,820
Here are the financial details on the house.

221
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,760
Thank you.

222
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,340
Are you prepared to make a 10% down payment?

223
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,460
Yes, we are.

224
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,960
Payments over thirty years?

225
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,760
Yes.

226
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,620
Do you think we can get a loan?

227
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,460
Well, it depends. Do you own any other property?

228
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,720
Any stocks or bonds?

229
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,920
No.

230
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,880
I see. Then you don't have any collateral.

231
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,420
Perhaps you could get a guarantor -

232
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,880
someone to sign for the loan for you.

233
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,260
Why is that necessary?

234
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,200
Since you don't have enough income,

235
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,200
and you don't already own any property,

236
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,620
the bank needs to be sure

237
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,180
you can pay the mortgage every month.

238
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,740
A guarantor is responsible for the loan

239
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,300
if you can't make the payments.

240
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:37,100
I see. Well, the idea of buying a house is exciting.

241
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,720
Thank you, Mr. Riley. We'll read this over carefully.

242
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,100
Thank you.

243
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,780
Good-bye. Thanks.

244
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,660
Good-bye. And hope to see you soon.

245
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,020
I hope so, too.

246
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,920
Take care.

247
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,480
Good-bye.

248
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,900
It all sounded so easy

249
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,800
until they mentioned needing collateral or a guarantor.

250
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,880
We have no collateral.

251
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,640
And I don't think it's a good idea

252
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,080
to ask Dad to sign as a guarantor.

253
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,320
I don't feel right about it.

254
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,620
I understand your feelings about it, Richard.

255
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,720
Now, tell me, what's the problem?

256
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,500
We can get a loan from the bank

257
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,260
if we can put up some collateral.

258
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,260
And we don't own anything to use as collateral.

259
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,820
Or someone can sign with us as a guarantor.

260
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,800
Why don't you speak to Dad?

261
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,960
No. If we buy a house, I want to be able to handle it alone.

262
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,940
Everybody needs help sometimes, Richard.

263
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,420
I understand Richard's feelings about it, Ellen.

264
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,920
In two or three months, I'll have an advance on my book

265
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,620
and be able to put more money down.

266
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,520
What about the house in Mount Kisco?

267
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,040
Somebody else'll buy it by then.

268
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,080
Then there'll be other houses, Marilyn.

269
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,860
Richard has a point. You're just beginning to look.

270
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,160
We're in no great rush. It's true.

271
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,920
This has been a great learning experience for us, Marilyn.

272
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,760
Talking to the real-estate agent.

273
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,060
Looking at the houses.

274
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,320
Talking to the loan officer at the bank.

275
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,560
It has been a learning experience. That's true.

276
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,360
I think you're doing the right thing. Taking your time.

277
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,640
Looking around. Especially with a purchase of this kind.

278
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,040
You're talking about a lot of money.

279
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,440
We'll call Mrs. Martinelli and tell her to keep looking for us.

280
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,460
And I'll call Mr. Riley at the bank

281
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,860
and tell him we'll see him in a couple of months.

282
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,140
And if you ever need Dad or me to help you...

283
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,220
We know.

284
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,440
You know we'll be there for you.

285
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,400
It's a Stewart tradition. We're a family.
