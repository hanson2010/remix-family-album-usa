Episode 15 - Second Honeymoon

3
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
What's this for?

4
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Just because. How's the baby?

5
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Fast asleep.

6
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,600
I'm sorry I missed him.

7
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
I had to work late.

8
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,600
What are the flowers for, Richard?

9
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Five years of happiness. Happy anniversary.

10
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
But our anniversary isn't until Saturday.

11
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
I couldn't wait.

12
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Besides, we are not going to be here Saturday.

13
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
We're not?

14
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Uh-uh.

15
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Where are we going to be?

16
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,600
If you had your choice of all the places in the world.

17
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
where would you choose to spend our anniversary?

18
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,600
The Watermill Inn.

19
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
I loved that place when we went on our honeymoon.

20
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Perfect! You picked the right place.

21
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
I don't understand.

22
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
You and I, Mrs. Stewart, Stewart

23
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
are going to spend a second honeymoon at the Watermill Inn.

24
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Oh, Richard! That's wonderful, but--

25
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
No buts.

26
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
What about the baby?

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Aren't we taking the baby on our honeymoon?

28
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Absolutely not.

29
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
The world's greatest grandmother, Mrs. Ellen Stewart,

30
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
has agreed to take care of him for the weekend.

31
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Richard, isn't that too much to ask of your mother?

32
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Too much? She loves taking care of Max.

33
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,600
But... I'll miss him.

34
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Well, we'll phone every hour,

35
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
and you can listen to him over the phone.

36
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Come on, Mar.

37
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,600
It's time you and I had a romantic weekend alone together.

38
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,600
We've earned it. What do you say?

39
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,600
It does sound tempting.

40
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,600
You're right. We've earned it.

41
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Great! I'll make a reservation right now.

42
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Remember that wonderful little balcony

43
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
where we had our meals ...

44
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
with a view of the Hudson River?

45
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
How could I forget?

46
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Hello. Is Mrs. Montefiore there?

47
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Ah. She's out.

48
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Yes. This is Richard Stewart.

49
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
My wife and I spent our honeymoon at the inn.

50
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,600
No, we didn't leave anything in the room.

51
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
It's five years ago.

52
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
We'd like to make a reservation for this weekend.

53
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Yes, a double room, please.

54
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
What?

55
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Are you sure? But... OK.

56
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Nothing available.

57
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Wait! Don't hang up!

58
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Can you recommend someplace nice - someplace nearby?

59
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Uh, hold it. Old Country Inn?

60
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Right. And the phone number?

61
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:59,600
555-2420. Thank you. 555 2420

62
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,600
He says there's another inn

63
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
just half a mile down the road from the Watermill.

64
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,600
It won't be the same, but what do you say?

65
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Well...

66
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
My mom is available to baby-sit this weekend.

67
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Well, OK. See if they have a room.

68
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Right!

69
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Hello. Is this the Old Country Inn?

70
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Yes. This is Richard Stewart.

71
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,600
The desk clerk at the Watemill suggested your inn.

72
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Would you happen to have a room for two availbale

73
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
this weekend?

74
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Something really nice.

75
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
My wife and I are celebrating our fifth anniversary.

76
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Yes. I'll hold. He's checking. You do?

77
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Great! What is the daily rate?

78
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,600
That's fine. Thank you.

79
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Yes, we'll be arriving by car about ten o'clock Friday night.

80
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Stewart. S-t-e-w-a-r-t. Thank you.

81
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Done! You and I, Mrs. Stewart.

82
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
are going to have a wonderful, romantic weekend!

83
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Richard, that's the baby.

84
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Right this way, Mr. and Mrs. Stewart.

85
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Well, it's small, but clean.

86
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Clean? You call this clean?

87
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Have a nice stay.

88
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Thank you. I don't believe this.

89
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Well, it isn't the Watermill Inn,

90
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,600
but let's get a look at the view.

91
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:38,600
How is the view?

92
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Great,

93
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,600
if you enjoy looking at a parking lot.

94
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Well, maybe we'll see the view in the morning.

95
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Right now, we should clean up this room.

96
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Sorry, Marilyn.

97
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Why should you be sorry?

98
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Well, the rain, the room, the view of the parking lot.

99
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,600
It isn't the way I hoped it would be.

100
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Stop blaming yourself.

101
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:29,600
After all, we're here, we're alone, we're together.

102
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,600
And I love you. Isn't that enough?

103
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
It is for me,

104
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
but I wanted this weekend to be special for you.

105
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:45,600
It is special. Happy anniversary.

106
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:53,600
It's still raining. I want to play tennis.

107
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,600
I want some breakfast.

108
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Let's call room service and order a nice breakfast,

109
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
and then we'll figure out what to do today.

110
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Right. Would you give me room service, please?

111
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:16,600
I beg your pardon? Oh, I see.

112
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:23,600
They don't have room service at Old Country Inn. Old Country Inn

113
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Well, let's go down to the coffee shop.

114
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,600
They don't have a coffee shop.

115
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,600
We can get our meals at Mrs. Montefiore's down the road.

116
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,600
That's OK, honey.

117
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
I love walking in the rain.

118
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Oh, you're being a really good sport about this, Marilyn,

119
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
but I think we should face the truth.

120
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
What's that?

121
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,600
This is not the way to spend our fifth anniversary.

122
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Well, what do you want to do?

123
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Why don't we get in the car and drive home?

124
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Oh, Richard, it really isn't that bad.

125
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Do you want to stick it out for the whole weekend?

126
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Well, I'll admit the room is uncomfortable.

127
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Uh-hum.

128
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
And I do feel bad about your mother

129
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
having to take care of the baby all weekend.

130
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Why don't we just check out?

131
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
OK.

132
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Hello? Yes. Yes, this is she.

133
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Oh, hello! How nice of you to remember us!

134
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Yes, my husband did call.

135
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:43,600
You do? Really? It won't be any trouble?

136
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Oh, yes, I think we'd like that very much.

137
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Fifteen minutes! Thank you. Good-bye.

138
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,600
You will never guess.

139
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Uh ... I give up.

140
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Mrs. Montefiore from the Watermill Inn.

141
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,600
What is she calling about?

142
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
They have an opening.

143
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Someone just checked out.

144
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,600
and Mrs. Montefiore has reserved the honeymoon suite for us.

145
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
You're kidding!

146
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
No. Isn't it wonderful?

147
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
It's fantastic!

148
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Oh. Now all it has to do is stop raining.

149
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Let's go.

150
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Welcome to the Watermill Inn.

151
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Oh, Richard,

152
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
it's exactly as it was when we were married!

153
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
And when I got married.

154
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Even the old patchwork quilt is the same!

155
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,600
My great-grandmother made that quilt

156
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
when Teddy Roosevelt was President.

157
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,600
In those days, when they made quilts.

158
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
they cut patches

159
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,600
from the old clothing of every member in the family

160
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
so that each one would be a part of it.

161
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
What a lovely tradition!

162
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Thank you for calling us.

163
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
I remember you and your wife

164
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
from the first time you stayed with us.

165
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,600
We were very young.

166
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
And very much in love.

167
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
We have a baby now.

168
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,600
How wonderful! A boy or a girl?

169
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
A boy - Max.

170
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Do you have a picture?

171
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,600
Would a professional photographer be without a picture?

172
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Oh, he's adorable!

173
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
And very bright.

174
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Like his father. A real Stewart.

175
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
And very good-looking, like his mother.

176
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Well, it's nice to have you with us again.

177
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Next time, bring the baby.

178
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,600
You see, Richard? Max is welcome here.

179
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Not on our anniversary.

180
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
This vacation is for you and me.

181
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,600
If there's anything you need, please call me.

182
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
I'll be in the front office all day.

183
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Oh, I took the liberty of ordering some breakfast for you.

184
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Just put it over there, Charles.

185
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Thank you, Charles.

186
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Compliments of the Watermill Inn. Watermill Inn

187
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Thank you.

188
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Thank you so much.

189
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Now, this is my idea of a good time.

190
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Let's see ... hotcakes and maple syrup, with scrambled eggs.

191
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Umm... smell that coffee... cinnamon and cloves.

192
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Homemade buttermilk biscuits.

193
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Slices of orange with burnt honey.

194
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Let's eat!

195
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
First I want to call home

196
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
and check on your mother and the baby.

197
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Honey, if there were any problems,

198
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
she would call us.

199
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
She doesn't know we've changed hotels.

200
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
You're right. Of course.

201
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Hello, operator.

202
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,600
I'd like to call Riverdale, New York.

203
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:34,600
This food is heavenly, isn't it?

204
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
This whole place is heavenly.

205
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Do you remember that old desk?

206
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Mrs. Montefiore told me that Montefiore

207
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
George Washington sat at that desk

208
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
and wrote to his wife Martha.

209
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
What do you want to do after breakfast?

210
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,600
Why don't we take a walk down to the river?

211
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
In the rain?

212
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,600
No. Look out the window. The sun is shining!

213
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Now this is my idea of a good time!
