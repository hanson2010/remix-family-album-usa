Episode 21 - A Big Fish in a Little Pond

3
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,600
I really like this one Susan. Do you?

4
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Turn around, Michelle. Let me see the back of it.

5
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,600
I like it a lot. It fits well.

6
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,600
It doesn't need any alterations. We must've bought the right size.

7
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
I like the color. She looks good in blue.

8
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
I like blue, too, Daddy.

9
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,000
Try on the skirt and blouse outfit, Michelle.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,600
The one that Daddy wanted you to wear.

11
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
OK.

12
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Michelle has been a different kid since we've been married.

13
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
She's never been happier.

14
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
And I've never been happier, Harry.

15
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,600
I love her very much. She's been a joy.

16
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
We're very lucky, the three of us...

17
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,600
and becoming part of the Stewart family, too.

18
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,600
We couldn't ask for anything more, could we?

19
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Well...

20
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Well...? Could we ask for anything more?

21
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Well... we...

22
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
How do you like it, Daddy?

23
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
It's my favorite outfit.

24
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,600
It's good for every day. It will be good for school, Michelle.

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
I like it, too. I always like skirts that go like this.

26
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Do you want to see the winter jacket on me, Susan?

27
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Yes, I do. Change back into your jeans,

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
and put on the new winter jacket we bought today.

29
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
OK.

30
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:03,600
What did you mean by "well"?

31
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
You had something on your mind

32
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
when I said we couldn't ask for anything more.

33
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Is everything all right?

34
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Everything is fine, Michelle.

35
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Let's take a look at the winter jacket. Come on over here, honey.

36
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,600
It's kind of warm.

37
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,600
It is. That's why we bought it for you.

38
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,600
This will be a perfect jacket for the wintertime

39
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
when it's very cold out.

40
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,600
But it's kind of small also. We must've bought the wrong size.

41
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Looks like we should've bought a bigger one.

42
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
I guess we'll have to exchange it, too.

43
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
I'm sure the store has others.

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
I look silly! It is too small!

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,600
You're growing so fast, Michelle.

46
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Can I take it off? I'm hot!

47
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Sure. Put it back in your room, and we'll hang everything up later.

48
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Well, are you going to tell me what's on your mind, Harry?

49
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:04,600
I have been offered a job with a major accounting company

50
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,600
in Los Angeles.

51
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,600
I have been offered a job with a major accounting company

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
in Los Angeles.

53
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Los Angeles? That's a big decision.

54
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,600
I know. It will also affect you and your job, if we decide to go.

55
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Wow! It sure will. But first tell me about the job, Harry.

56
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
If it's a good one, then we'll make it work for us.

57
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,600
I have a client in the garment business, on Seventh Avenue.

58
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
I do his taxes every year.

59
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,600
He has a big sales office in Los Angeles,

60
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
and the company in Los Angeles

61
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
that does his major accounting work

62
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,600
is looking for an executive. And he recommended me.

63
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
That's wonderful, Harry.

64
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Yes, but it would mean that we'd have to move to L.A.

65
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
What about the salary?

66
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
The real discussion comes tomorrow.

67
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Susan, I don't plan to make any decisions

68
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,600
until I have a chance to talk with you about it.

69
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
I understand, Harry.

70
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
And I don't have to make a quick decision.

71
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,600
They know that I'm married and that I have a family.

72
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Well, there's a lot to think about.

73
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,600
If it's a good job,

74
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
then I've got to do some thinking about

75
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,600
my career opportunities in Los Angeles.

76
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Is everything OK?

77
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Yes, honey.

78
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Hello. Hello there.

79
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Are you ready for lunch with your grandpa?

80
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Oh! Hi, Grandpa. Yes, of course, I am, but my mind isn't.

81
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
What's the matter, Susan?

82
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
A real dilemma.

83
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Does it have anything to do with you and Harry?

84
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Yes, but I don't know where to start.

85
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Maybe I can help. Tell me what it is, Susan.

86
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Thanks, Grandpa. Please sit down.

87
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Oh! Harry has been offered a job in Los Angeles.

88
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Well, this is something to think about.

89
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,600
There are so many things to consider. There's Michelle.

90
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,600
I wonder if a move would be a bad thing for her. And my job.

91
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
I don't know if I can get a good job in Los Angeles.

92
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,600
And what about our family?

93
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Can I tell you what I think?

94
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Tell me.

95
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
I think that you're very successful

96
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,600
and that you have a fantastic reputation in the toy industry.

97
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
I think you could talk to Mr. Marchetta,

98
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
and I think

99
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,600
he could help you find a real good job in Los Angeles.

100
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
He was very helpful to me, remember?

101
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,600
I suppose I could call him.

102
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,600
But I'm not so sure that I want to leave New York,

103
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
you, and the rest of our family.

104
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Well, I'm not going to kid you, Susan.

105
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
You know we'd all miss you.

106
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,600
But this should be your decision.

107
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,600
It's something that only you and Harry can work out.

108
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,600
If moving to L.A. is in Harry's best interest,

109
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
I have to do what I can do to support him.

110
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,600
In every marriage,

111
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
sacrifices have to be made by one partner from time to time.

112
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,600
And what about Michelle?

113
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Well, what do you think?

114
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,600
I think Michelle is better off staying where she is.

115
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
What does she think?

116
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,600
I don't know for sure.

117
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Well, you'll have to ask her.

118
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
I think I'm going to have a talk with Mr. Marchetta

119
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
and get his feelings about my leaving.

120
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,600
And about helping me find a job in Los Angeles.

121
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Good idea.

122
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
I'll call him right now. No point in delaying.

123
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Thanks, Grandpa.

124
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Harry, it's the perfect job for you. You'll love it.

125
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
It's a big decision for me, Bill.

126
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,600
And I have to discuss it with my wife.

127
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
I don't know if it's right for her.

128
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,600
She'll love it. It's a once-in-a-lifetime offer, Harry.

129
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
OK. Tell it to me again.

130
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
The company is Craft and Craft,

131
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
the biggest accounting company in the country.

132
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
I know the company well. It's big.

133
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
The biggest.

134
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Yeah, yeah. The biggest. When do I have to let you know?

135
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Talk it over. Think it over. Let me know by the end of the week.

136
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
When would we have to move?

137
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
As soon as possible.

138
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
I also have my daughter to consider.

139
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
I don't want to interrupt her school year.

140
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Let me know by the end of the week.

141
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
It's a great opportunity for you, Harry.

142
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Believe me.

143
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
I know.

144
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Craft and Craft is the biggest in the country.

145
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Yeah, I know. The biggest.

146
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,600
I think Michelle is asleep now. Let's talk.

147
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:42,600
I met with Bill York today.

148
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,600
And I talked with Mr. Marchetta. Did York make the offer?

149
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Yup. He asked me if I want the job.

150
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
That's exciting, Harry. What was it?

151
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
A vice-presidency

152
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
with the biggest accounting company in the country -

153
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Craft and Craft.

154
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Aren't you excited about that?

155
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Sure I am. But there's so much more to consider.

156
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,600
I talked to Mr. Marchetta.

157
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
What did he say? Did you tell him about me?

158
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Of course, Harry. I want what's best for you,

159
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,600
and I think I can get a good job

160
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
through Mr. Marchetta

161
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
in Los Angeles also.

162
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
You're kidding.

163
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
No, I'm not kidding.

164
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
I talked with him, and he understands completely.

165
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,600
He has a major toy buyer in Los Angeles,

166
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,600
and he's pretty sure that I can get a good job there.

167
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
Unbelievable!

168
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,600
But I think we should talk to Michelle about all of this.

169
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,600
You're right. We'll talk to her about it.

170
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,600
And how do you feel about taking the job in Los Angeles?

171
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
How should I feel?

172
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
It's the biggest company in the country.

173
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
Well, then you feel good about taking it?

174
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Well... I feel fine about it. Why shouldn't I?

175
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,600
I love my school. I have so many good friends there now.

176
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
I wouldn't miss a day even if I were really sick.

177
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Come and sit down for a minute, Michelle.

178
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,600
I'd like to talk to you about something.

179
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Something important.

180
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
What's wrong, Susan?

181
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Oh, there's nothing wrong, Michelle.

182
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
But your daddy and I are talking about something

183
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
that I'd like your opinion about.

184
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,600
I know. I heard you talking about it

185
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
the other night when I was trying on my new clothes.

186
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,600
It's about moving to Los Angeles.

187
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,600
You're right. How do you feel about it?

188
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Well, I really wouldn't want to move, but...

189
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
But?

190
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,600
But if you and Daddy wanted to,

191
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,600
I guess you know what's best for the family and for me.

192
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
That's very considerate of you, Michelle.

193
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
But what about your friends?

194
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
I'd miss them a lot,

195
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,600
but I know what it feels like to miss someone.

196
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Honey, we don't have to move

197
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
if you're not going to be happy about it.

198
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Does Daddy want to move?

199
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,600
I think so. He's going to tell us tonight about the job offer.

200
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Well, how was everybody's day today?

201
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Michelle was chosen to do Michelle

202
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
the school poster for the play this year.

203
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Congratulations, Michelle! That's something!

204
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,600
And how was your day, Susan?

205
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
I see you're in a good mood.

206
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Why don't you tell us about your day.

207
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,600
I met with Bill York.

208
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
It's OK to talk about it, Harry.

209
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Michelle knows all about it. Michelle

210
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Really?

211
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Really, Harry.

212
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Michelle and I have all kinds of feelings

213
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,600
about leaving New York, the family, and friends.

214
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,600
But if you think you should take the job, we're behind you.

215
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
What about Michelle's school?

216
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,600
We'll move after the school term.

217
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
What about her new friends?

218
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,600
I'll make new friends wherever we are as long as we're together.

219
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,600
We're a family, Harry.

220
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Whatever you think is right for you is right for us.

221
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:02,600
I am so touched. The two of you are really something.

222
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
We love you, Daddy.

223
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
And I love you.

224
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,600
OK. Now, tell us about your talk with Mr. York.

225
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Did you take the job?

226
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Nope.

227
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
What?

228
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
No? You didn't take it?

229
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,600
No, I did not take the job.

230
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
But, Daddy, I thought ...

231
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Harry, you didn't turn it down because of me... Harry

232
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Or me?

233
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
No, no. I turned it down because of me.

234
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
How's that?

235
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Well, I began to think about you and about Michelle,

236
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
and then I asked myself,

237
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
do I really want to work for the biggest company in the country?

238
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
And?

239
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
And I don't.

240
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
I went into business for myself

241
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
because I like being my own boss.

242
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,600
I run my own company. I'm a big fish in a little pond.

243
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
I'm not really sure I want to be a little fish in a big pond.

244
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Oh, Daddy, does that mean we don't have to move?

245
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
That's right, sweetheart.

246
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Are you sure?

247
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
I couldn't be more sure, Susan.

248
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,600
I'm glad if you are, Harry.

249
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
And besides,

250
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
how could I live in Los Angeles

251
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,600
when all my favorite people live here?

252
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Your favorite people?

253
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Who's that?

254
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,600
The Stewart family, of course.
