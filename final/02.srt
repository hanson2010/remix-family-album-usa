Excuse me. Can you help me?

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Sure, what do you want?

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Where is 83 Wooster Street? Wooster

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's easy. Walk to the corner.

Then make a left turn.

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Then walk two blocks to the traffic light.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Make another left to Wooster.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thank you.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
To the corner and then a left?

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah. A left.

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hot dog? Only seventy-five cents.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No. Thank you. I have a dinner date.

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:36,000
555-9470...and it's busy.... 555-9470

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Try again.

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:52,000
555-9470...and it's still busy. 555-9470

18
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm looking for 83 Wooster Street.

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes. Wooster Street is two blocks,

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and 83 is to the right, about two houses. 83

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you, thank you!

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You're welcome.

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hello, Harry. It's nice to meet you.

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Nice to meet you, Susan.

30
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Sorry I'm late.

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The traffic. The parking. I was lost.

32
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What pretty flowers! Thank you.

33
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, please come in.

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't worry about being late. It's fine.

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Excuse the mess. I just moved here.

36
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh, I'd like you to meet my sister-in-law Marilyn.

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Marilyn Stewart, this is Harry Bennett. Marilyn Stewart

Nice to meet you, Harry.

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Are we too late for our dinner reservation?

41
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No, the restaurant will hold our table.

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I know the owner very well.

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I eat there a lot.

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Do you know the phone number of the restaurant?

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'd like to call home

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and leave the number with the baby-sitter.

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Sure. The number is... five five five...seventeen twenty.

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
May I use the phone?

00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Five five five...one seven two oh. Hello? 555-1720

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Hi, Michelle. It's Daddy.

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Can I speak to Betty?

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I want to leave the phone number of the restaurant....

53
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hi, Betty. I'll be at five five five...seventeen twenty.

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
OK. Thanks. See you later.

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Well, that's done. Shall we go?

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm ready. See you later, Marilyn.

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Have a nice evening.

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Bye, Marilyn. Hope to see you again.

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Me, too. Have fun!

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Thanks.

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
After you.

62
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Ah! Miss Stewart! Welcome!

63
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
How are you?

64
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Fine, Somsak. And you?

65
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Fine, thank you.

66
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
This is my friend Harry Bennett.

67
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Pleased to meet you.

68
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Very nice to meet you.

Any friend of Miss Stewart's is welcome at Somsak's. Stewart

Follow me, please.

71
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
I like it here.

72
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,100
I do, too. I come here often.

73
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,100
A special place for special people.

74
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
Thank you, Somsak.

75
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:37,100
Well! Nice restaurant.

76
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,100
Would you like something to drink?

77
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Yes, I'd like a glass of ginger ale with ice.

78
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Harry, what would you like? Harry

79
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,100
Do you have a dry white wine?

80
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,100
How about a California chablis?

81
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Chablis is fine.

82
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,100
What would you like to eat?

83
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,100
I'd like the mee krob.

84
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Harry, would you like to see a menu? Harry

85
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,100
No, it's Ok.

86
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,100
I'll have the mee krob also.

87
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,100
What is it?

88
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,100
Crispy fried noodles. I love them.

89
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,100
May I bring you a salad?

90
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,100
Oh yes.

91
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
What do you recommend today?

92
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
I recommend rose-petal salad.

93
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Special for new friends.

94
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Rose-petal salad?

95
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,100
Why not?

96
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
I'll take care of everything.

97
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:29,100
I hope you're hungry.

98
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,100
What? Oh, yes. Starving. Well, I...

99
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Well, I ...

100
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:43,100
What do you do at Universe Toy Company?

101
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,100
I'm the vice-president of new toy development.

102
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,100
Terrific!

103
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,100
I know you 're a CPA.

104
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
That's true. Harry Bennett,

105
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
certified public accountant.

106
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
I love numbers.

107
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
I do some work for Smith and Dale,

108
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Your company's accounting firm.

109
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,100
And so...

110
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Here we are.

111
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Yes.

112
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,100
I have a daughter.

113
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
I know. How old is she?

114
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
She's nine years old.

115
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,100
That's a nice age. What's her name?

116
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,100
Michelle. Michelle

117
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,100
Do you have a picture of her?

118
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:29,100
She's very pretty.

119
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,100
Thank you.

120
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:39,100
Rose-petal salad.

121
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,100
And there's a phone call for you, Mr. Bennett. Bennett

122
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Excuse me, Susan.

123
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,100
I hope nothing is wrong.

124
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
I'll get the rest of the dinner.

125
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Excuse me.

126
00:11:51,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Please forgive me, Susan, but...

127
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
I have to leave. I feel terrible, but...

128
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,100
What's the matter?

129
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,100
My daughter isn't feeling well.

130
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100
Oh no! Is it serious?

131
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,100
I don't know. The baby-sitter says she has a stomachache,

132
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,100
and she's crying.

133
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,100
I'll have to go home.

134
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
Will you forgive me?

135
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,100
Of course. I'm so sorry for Michelle.

136
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,100
And you didn't have a chance to eat.

137
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
Oh, it's OK.

138
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Let me take you home first.

139
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
No, no. Please, go ahead.

140
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,100
It's our first date.

141
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,100
We'll make another.

142
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,100
Please don't worry.

143
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,100
I'll phone you.

144
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,100
I hope your daughter is all right. Good-bye.

145
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,100
Good-bye.

146
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,100
What happened?

147
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,100
The baby-sitter called.

148
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,100
His daughter is sick.

149
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
What's wrong?

150
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
I think she has a stomachache.

151
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,100
He's a good father.

152
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:43,100
So... what do you think of him?

153
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,100
He's very nice.

154
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,100
But I think he was nervous tonight.

155
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,100
It was his first date in two years.

156
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,100
Will you see him again?

157
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,100
I hope so.

158
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,100
This food is delicious.

159
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,100
He didn't get a thing to eat.

160
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,100
You ordered enough for three or four people,

161
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
but I'm not complaining.

162
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
The food is delicious.

163
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,100
Who is that?

164
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Do you think it's...

165
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:29,100
No. You won't believe it, Marilyn!

166
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,100
I believe it. Even without looking.

167
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Hi!

168
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
How...?

169
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Your downstairs neighbor let me in.

170
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Did you go home?

171
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,100
I did , but everything is OK,

172
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
so I decided to come back.

173
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,100
To apologize for leaving so early,

174
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
I brought you a little gift.

175
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,100
It's a bonsai tree

176
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,100
Hi, Marilyn. I hope it's not too late.

177
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Oh, not at all. We're still eating.

178
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,100
Please, come in. Join us.

179
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
It's our meal from the restaurant.

180
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,100
And how is your daughter?

181
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Oh, she's fine.

182
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,100
It's good that you went back.

183
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,100
Yes, I think it's important for me to be there

184
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
since her mother died.

185
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,100
I agree. Aren't you hungry?

186
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,100
As a matter of fact... I am hungry.

187
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
There's lots of food left.

188
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,100
Mmm, this is delicious!

189
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Enjoy!

190
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,100
I'm going to excuse myself.

191
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,100
I have a lot of work to do to get ready for tomorrow.

192
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,100
Good night, Harry. It was nice meeting you. Harry

193
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,100
Bye, Marilyn.

194
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Good night, Susan.

195
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Good night, Marilyn.

196
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,100
She's going to a fashion show here in the city tomorrow.

197
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
She is sleeping here

198
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,100
so she won't have to travel from Riverdale in the morning.

199
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
You two must be close.

200
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,100
we are.

201
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,100
The whole Stewart family is close. Stewart

202
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,100
I like that.

203
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:13,100
And then, two years ago, my wife died.

204
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
You miss her.

205
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:20,100
I do...yes, but I have Michelle...

206
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,100
and with time...

207
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,100
Is there anyone else in your life?

208
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,100
No, not yet. What about you?

209
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,100
Oh, I date occasionally,

210
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,100
but my work keeps me busy.

211
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Ooh, speaking of keeping busy-

212
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,100
I have an early start tomorrow,

213
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
and the baby-sitter has to get home.

214
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,100
Where did the time go?

215
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
It's midnight.

216
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:54,100
Thank you, Susan.

217
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
I had a nice evening.

218
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:08,100
Me, too, Harry. Harry?

219
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Yes?

220
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,100
I'd like to meet your daughter someday.

221
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,100
Does that mean that I can see you again?

222
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
Of course.

223
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Wonderful. I'll call you,

224
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,100
and we'll go out to dinner.

225
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,100
Please do.

226
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,100
I promise I won't leave early.

227
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,100
It was for a good reason.

228
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
You know something?

229
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,100
What?

230
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,100
I think we're going to be good friends.

231
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,100
Good night, Susan.

232
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,100
Good night, Harry,

233
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,100
Have a safe trip home.

234
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:47,100
Are you all right?

235
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,100
Sorry.

236
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:55,100
I never liked that umbrella stand.

237
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,100
Good night, Harry.
