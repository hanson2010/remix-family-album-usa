Episode 02 - The Blind Date

3
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,176
Excuse me. Can you help me?

4
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,944
Sure, what do you want?

5
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,424
Where is 83 Wooster Street?

6
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,960
That's easy. Walk to the corner.

7
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,624
Then make a left turn.

8
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,712
Then walk two blocks to the traffic light.

9
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,224
Make another left to Wooster.

10
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,536
Thank you.

11
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,056
To the corner and then a left?

12
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,296
Yeah. A left.

13
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,184
Hot dog? Only seventy-five cents.

14
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,320
No. Thank you. I have a dinner date.

15
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:47,832
555-9470... and it's busy.

16
00:02:53,368 --> 00:02:54,536
Try again.

17
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:06,992
555-9470... and it's still busy.

18
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:14,856
Excuse me, ma'am.

19
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,160
I'm looking for 83 Wooster Street.

20
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,360
Yes. Wooster Street is two blocks,

21
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,392
and 83 is to the right, about two houses.

22
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,192
Thank you, thank you!

23
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,344
You're welcome.

24
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:02,528
Who is it?

25
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,552
Harry Bennett. Is this Susan?

26
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,960
Yes, it is. Come up.

27
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,696
I'm on the top floor.

28
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,784
Hello, Harry. It's nice to meet you.

29
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,216
Nice to meet you, Susan.

30
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,584
Sorry I'm late.

31
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:20,112
The traffic. The parking. I was lost.

32
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,688
What pretty flowers! Thank you.

33
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,360
Oh, please come in.

34
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Don't worry about being late. It's fine.

35
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,136
Excuse the mess. I just moved here.

36
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,984
Oh, I'd like you to meet my sister-in-law Marilyn.

37
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,624
Marilyn Stewart, this is Harry Bennett.

38
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,568
Pleased to meet you.

39
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,000
Nice to meet you, Harry.

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,272
Are we too late for our dinner reservation?

41
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,600
No, the restaurant will hold our table.

42
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,768
I know the owner very well.

43
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,696
I eat there a lot.

44
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,472
Do you know the phone number of the restaurant?

45
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,288
I'd like to call home

46
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,600
and leave the number with the baby-sitter.

47
00:04:52,600 --> 00:05:01,744
Sure. The number is 555-1720.

48
00:05:03,448 --> 00:05:04,280
May I use the phone?

49
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:19,992
555-1720? Hello?

50
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,624
Hi, Michelle. It's Daddy.

51
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,704
Can I speak to Betty?

52
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:26,872
I want to leave the phone number of the restaurant.

53
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:32,248
Hi, Betty. I'll be at 555-1720.

54
00:05:32,976 --> 00:05:35,120
OK. Thanks. See you later.

55
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:40,168
Well, that's done. Shall we go?

56
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,688
I'm ready. See you later, Marilyn.

57
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,792
Have a nice evening.

58
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:46,040
Bye, Marilyn. Hope to see you again.

59
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,400
Me, too. Have fun!

60
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,112
Thanks.

61
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:53,488
After you.

62
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,904
Ah! Miss Stewart! Welcome!

63
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,864
How are you?

64
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,288
Fine, Somsak. And you?

65
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,264
Fine, thank you.

66
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,368
This is my friend Harry Bennett.

67
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Pleased to meet you.

68
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,696
Very nice to meet you.

69
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,488
Any friend of Miss Stewart's is welcome at Somsak's.

70
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,816
Follow me, please.

71
00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:15,040
I like it here.

72
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,200
I do, too. I come here often.

73
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,800
A special place for special people.

74
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,360
Thank you, Somsak.

75
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,520
Well! Nice restaurant.

76
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,224
Would you like something to drink?

77
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,904
Yes, I'd like a glass of ginger ale with ice.

78
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,200
Harry, what would you like?

79
00:09:38,008 --> 00:09:40,088
Do you have a dry white wine?

80
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,720
How about a California chablis?

81
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,760
Chablis is fine.

82
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:45,152
What would you like to eat?

83
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:47,984
I'd like the mee krob.

84
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,976
Harry, would you like to see a menu?

85
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:50,952
No, it's OK.

86
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,360
I'll have the mee krob also.

87
00:09:56,408 --> 00:09:57,136
What is it?

88
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,680
Crispy fried noodles. I love them.

89
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,528
May I bring you a salad?

90
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,624
Oh yes.

91
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,144
What do you recommend today?

92
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,280
I recommend rose-petal salad.

93
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,888
Special for new friends.

94
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:12,104
Rose-petal salad?

95
00:10:12,928 --> 00:10:13,776
Why not?

96
00:10:14,472 --> 00:10:16,112
I'll take care of everything.

97
00:10:19,688 --> 00:10:22,000
I hope you're hungry.

98
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:28,632
What? Oh, yes. Starving. Well, I...

99
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,544
Well, I...

100
00:10:33,752 --> 00:10:36,264
What do you do at Universe Toy Company?

101
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,400
I'm the vice-president of new toy development.

102
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,184
Terrific!

103
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,336
I know you're a CPA.

104
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,792
That's true. Harry Bennett,

105
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,616
certified public accountant.

106
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,992
I love numbers.

107
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,704
I do some work for Smith and Dale,

108
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,256
Your company's accounting firm.

109
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,320
And so...

110
00:10:55,512 --> 00:10:56,976
Here we are.

111
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,664
Yes.

112
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,144
I have a daughter.

113
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,320
I know. How old is she?

114
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,936
She's nine years old.

115
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,168
That's a nice age. What's her name?

116
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,152
Michelle.

117
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,336
Do you have a picture of her?

118
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,728
She's very pretty.

119
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,080
Thank you.

120
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,848
Rose-petal salad.

121
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,200
And there's a phone call for you, Mr. Bennett.

122
00:11:35,368 --> 00:11:36,520
Excuse me, Susan.

123
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:40,704
I hope nothing is wrong.

124
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:42,736
I'll get the rest of the dinner.

125
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,616
Excuse me.

126
00:11:56,464 --> 00:11:58,704
Please forgive me, Susan, but...

127
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,288
I have to leave. I feel terrible, but...

128
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,376
What's the matter?

129
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,536
My daughter isn't feeling well.

130
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,064
Oh no! Is it serious?

131
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,016
I don't know. The baby-sitter says she has a stomachache,

132
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:13,840
and she's crying.

133
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,720
I'll have to go home.

134
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,144
Will you forgive me?

135
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,544
Of course. I'm so sorry for Michelle.

136
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,456
And you didn't have a chance to eat.

137
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,512
Oh, it's OK.

138
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,880
Let me take you home first.

139
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,912
No, no. Please, go ahead.

140
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:28,392
It's our first date.

141
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,128
We'll make another.

142
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,216
Please don't worry.

143
00:12:32,408 --> 00:12:33,936
I'll phone you.

144
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,696
I hope your daughter is all right. Good-bye.

145
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:39,064
Good-bye.

146
00:15:58,496 --> 00:15:59,888
What happened?

147
00:16:00,768 --> 00:16:02,632
The baby-sitter called.

148
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:04,256
His daughter is sick.

149
00:16:05,408 --> 00:16:06,752
What's wrong?

150
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,176
I think she has a stomachache.

151
00:16:11,248 --> 00:16:12,992
He's a good father.

152
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,840
So... what do you think of him?

153
00:16:20,072 --> 00:16:21,568
He's very nice.

154
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,872
But I think he was nervous tonight.

155
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,520
It was his first date in two years.

156
00:16:30,328 --> 00:16:31,864
Will you see him again?

157
00:16:32,448 --> 00:16:33,752
I hope so.

158
00:16:36,984 --> 00:16:39,128
This food is delicious.

159
00:16:41,136 --> 00:16:43,528
He didn't get a thing to eat.

160
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,352
You ordered enough for three or four people,

161
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,808
but I'm not complaining.

162
00:16:48,264 --> 00:16:49,920
The food is delicious.

163
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:53,544
Who is that?

164
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,728
Do you think it's...

165
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:04,280
No. You won't believe it, Marilyn!

166
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,064
I believe it. Even without looking.

167
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:10,536
Hi!

168
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,568
How...?

169
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,424
Your downstairs neighbor let me in.

170
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,768
Did you go home?

171
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,304
I did, but everything is OK,

172
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,408
so I decided to come back.

173
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:21,952
To apologize for leaving so early,

174
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,824
I brought you a little gift.

175
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:26,656
It's a bonsai tree for your new apartment.

176
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:29,792
Hi, Marilyn. I hope it's not too late.

177
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,672
Oh, not at all. We're still eating.

178
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:34,896
Please, come in. Join us.

179
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:37,600
It's our meal from the restaurant.

180
00:17:38,896 --> 00:17:41,120
And how is your daughter?

181
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,984
Oh, she's fine. It was only a tummy ache.

182
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,584
It's good that you went back.

183
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:49,176
Yes, I think it's important for me to be there

184
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,280
since her mother died.

185
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:55,176
I agree. Aren't you hungry?

186
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,704
As a matter of fact... I am hungry.

187
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,208
There's lots of food left.

188
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:04,856
Mmm, this is delicious!

189
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,288
Enjoy!

190
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,336
I'm going to excuse myself.

191
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,576
I have a lot of work to do to get ready for tomorrow.

192
00:18:12,464 --> 00:18:14,384
Good night, Harry. It was nice meeting you.

193
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,344
Bye, Marilyn.

194
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:16,488
Good night, Susan.

195
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:17,896
Good night, Marilyn.

196
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:23,208
She's going to a fashion show here in the city tomorrow.

197
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,784
She is sleeping here

198
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,288
so she won't have to travel from Riverdale in the morning.

199
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,024
You two must be close.

200
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:31,392
We are.

201
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,776
The whole Stewart family is close.

202
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,840
I like that.

203
00:18:46,016 --> 00:18:48,816
And then, two years ago, my wife died.

204
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:51,240
You miss her.

205
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,880
I do... yes, but I have Michelle and...

206
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,600
with time...

207
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:02,472
Is there anyone else in your life?

208
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:08,048
No, not yet. What about you?

209
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,952
Oh, I date occasionally,

210
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,296
but my work keeps me busy.

211
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,760
Ooh, speaking of keeping busy,

212
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,240
I have an early start tomorrow,

213
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,168
and the baby-sitter has to get home.

214
00:19:20,016 --> 00:19:22,464
Where did the time go?

215
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,424
It's midnight.

216
00:19:28,128 --> 00:19:29,400
Thank you, Susan.

217
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:31,256
I had a nice evening.

218
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:42,816
Me, too, Harry. Harry?

219
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,416
Yes?

220
00:19:45,024 --> 00:19:48,296
I'd like to meet your daughter someday.

221
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:51,392
Does that mean that I can see you again?

222
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,064
Of course.

223
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,776
Wonderful. I'll call you,

224
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,912
and we'll go out to dinner.

225
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:56,768
Please do.

226
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,680
I promise I won't leave early.

227
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:01,576
It was for a good reason.

228
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:03,720
You know something?

229
00:20:04,272 --> 00:20:04,984
What?

230
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,936
I think we're going to be good friends.

231
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:09,712
Good night, Susan.

232
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,416
Good night, Harry.

233
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,080
Have a safe trip home.

234
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,240
Are you all right?

235
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:25,280
Sorry.

236
00:20:26,072 --> 00:20:28,656
I never liked that umbrella stand.

237
00:20:30,824 --> 00:20:32,176
Good night, Harry.
