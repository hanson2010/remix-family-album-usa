Episode 08 - You're Going to Be Fine

3
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Molly, I need your special talent for handling special matters. Molly

4
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Like what special matters?

5
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Well, I have a scheduling problem.

6
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Yes?

7
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,600
I have three tonsillectomies set for Friday with Dr. Earl.

8
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Yes?

9
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,600
I need to fit a fourth operation into his schedule.

10
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,600
And ... I know you can do it.

11
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Who's the patient?

12
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Carl Herrera. Carl Herrera

13
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
The boy has infected tonsils,

14
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
and we should remove them as soon as possible.

15
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Well, I'll try to arrange the schedule, Dr. Stewart.

16
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
But it's not going to be easy.

17
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,600
I know you'll be able to take care of it.

18
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Well, Mrs. Herrera,

19
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Carl will be perfectly fine after we remove his tonsils.

20
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Thank you for your reassurance, Dr. Stewart.

21
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,600
He's had so many colds and sore throats recently.

22
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Well, it's a very easy operation, Carl.

23
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
You won't feel a thing.

24
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
But when do they do it?

25
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
This Friday.

26
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
But Saturday's my birthday.

27
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Well, we could reschedule the operation, Mrs. Herrera,

28
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
but I don't want to put it off too long.

29
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
No, I think it's important to do it now.

30
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,600
We can have a birthday party for you, Carl,

31
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
When you come out of the hospital.

32
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
But it won't be on my birthday.

33
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,600
But your health is more important, Carl. Believe me.

34
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
I don't want my tonsils out.

35
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Nurse Baker, would you come in, please? Baker

36
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Hello, Mrs. Herrera. Hi, Carl, how you doing?

37
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
I don't want my tonsils out.

38
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Come with me, Carl.

39
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
You and I will talk this over.

40
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:34,600
She has a special way with kids.

41
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
She sure does.

42
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Carl, does your throat hurt? Carl

43
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Yes.

44
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
OK. Do you want to get better?

45
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Yes.

46
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
OK. We want you to get better, too.

47
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
You'll have your tonsils out tomorrow,

48
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,600
and you won't get so many colds anymore.

49
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
But if I have my tonsils out tomorrow,

50
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
I'll miss my birthday party on Saturday.

51
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
I know.

52
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
It's a problem, isn't it?

53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Let me try to work something out.

54
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,600
What?

55
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
I have to think about it.

56
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
You're fooling me.

57
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Oh, I'm not, Carl.

58
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Give me a chance to think about it,

59
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
and I'll come up with something.

60
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
A surprise?

61
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Maybe.

62
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
But you just put on your pajamas and robe,

63
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
and I'll think of a surprise.

64
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Will it hurt?

65
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
No.

66
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
There are other boys and girls here,

67
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
and they're having their tonsils out.

68
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
You'll meet them.

69
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
I don't want to.

70
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Change your clothes, Carl.

71
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Everything will be just fine.

72
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,100
OK.

73
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,100
Do you know how to play charades?

74
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,100
Frank, you've never played charades? Frank

75
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Nope.

76
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Carl, you're sure you've never played? Carl

77
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:20,100
OK, Betty, Tim, and Frank.

78
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
We're going to play charades.

79
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Frank, you can learn as we go. Frank

80
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
And, Carl, you join in at any time.

81
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,100
OK, let me think.

82
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,100
OK, I've got one.

83
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:44,100
All right.

84
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,100
A movie!

85
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
A movie!

86
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
Right.

87
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,100
A movie.

88
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
OK.

89
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,100
Six words.

90
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,100
It has six words.

91
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
That's easy.

92
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
I can play.

93
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,100
Good. OK.

94
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,100
We've got a movie.

95
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
The title ...

96
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Six words.

97
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,100
Right.

98
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
First word ...

99
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,100
Sounds like.

100
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Sounds like ...

101
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,100
You got that part right.

102
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Yes.

103
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Sounds like ...

104
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,100
Sounds like what?

105
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
Sounds like no.

106
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Absolutely right, Frank.

107
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
Sounds like no.

108
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
OK.

109
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
We've got a movie.

110
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Six words.

111
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
The first word sounds like no.

112
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Row. Row. Row

113
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
Go. Go

114
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Nope.

115
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,100
Show. Show

116
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
That's it--show.

117
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
No ... OK ...

118
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:57,100
Snow.

119
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Absolutely right, Betty.

120
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Sounds like no -- snow.

121
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,100
OK, a movie. Six words.

122
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,100
The first word is snow.

123
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
This is fun.

124
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
Oh, OK.

125
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,100
The fifth word.

126
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Right, fifth word.

127
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Seven?

128
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,100
Absolutely right.

129
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Very good.

130
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,100
The fifth word is seven.

131
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100
OK, we've got a movie.

132
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,100
The first word is snow.

133
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,100
Fifth word, seven.

134
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,100
I got it!

135
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
I got it!

136
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,100
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs

137
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:40,100
I got it.

138
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
I got it.

139
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Frank, you got it. Frank

140
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
Betty, you had it, but you didn't say it. Betty

141
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
I knew it.

142
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Carl, now you know charades. Carl

143
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Why don't you join us?

144
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
I don't like charades.

145
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,100
It's for babies.

146
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
Oh, I like it.

147
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,100
Well, they're babies.

148
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,100
You're a sore loser.

149
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Yeah.

150
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
No arguing.

151
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,100
Save your voices.

152
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Between now and tomorrow

153
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
you're all going to have your tonsils out.

154
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
And you won't be able to speak for a while.

155
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,100
So save your voices till then.

156
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,100
Hi, gang. Hi, everybody.

157
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,100
Well, what's going on?

158
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
I sure I am glad to see you, Dr. Stewart.

159
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,100
This is a rough group.

160
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,100
I didn't want to play charades,

161
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,100
so they're angry at me.

162
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,100
Why don't you want to play?

163
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Because I don't want to be here.

164
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,100
I don't want my tonsils out.

165
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
Why not?

166
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Because my birthday is tomorrow.

167
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,100
My mother promised me a birthday party with a clown.

168
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,100
But you can have one when you go home, Carl.

169
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,100
But my birthday is tomorrow.

170
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
I'm sorry, Carl.

171
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,100
Carl, you'll have your party when you go home, Carl

172
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,100
But it won't be on my birthday!

173
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,100
And you promised me a surprise.

174
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,100
It hurts, doesn't it?

175
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,100
You'll feel better tomorrow, Betty, believe me.

176
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,100
Only one day, and it won't hurt as much.

177
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,100
Do you feel like eating?

178
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
Having some dinner?

179
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,100
Oh, don't look so sad.

180
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
Let me tell you about your dinner.

181
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
It's ice cream.

182
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,100
Ice cream.

183
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,100
All kinds of flavors.

184
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
Chocolate.

185
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,100
Strawberry?

186
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,100
Vanilla?

187
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Vanilla, too?

188
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,100
I see you're feeling better already, Betty.

189
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,100
So you will have dinner?

190
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,100
OK, honey, we'll see to it

191
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,100
that you have strawberry and vanilla ice cream.

192
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Just rest now.

193
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
You need some rest to help you get better quickly.

194
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:28,100
Hi, Frank.

195
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,100
How you doing?

196
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,100
Oh, come on now.

197
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
You're a big boy.

198
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
It doesn't hurt that much, does it?

199
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,100
Oh, I'm sorry it hurts so much,

200
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,100
and you won't be able to have dinner.

201
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100
You're just going to have to have ice cream.

202
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,100
Yes, ice cream.

203
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Lots of flavors.

204
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,100
Want to hear them?

205
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Chocolate?

206
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,100
Then chocolate it is.

207
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
One scoop or two?

208
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Three scoops?

209
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
Then three it will be.

210
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:13,100
You want three scoops also?

211
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,100
Chocolate, too?

212
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,100
Well, I see you're feeling better.

213
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:22,100
Well, at least you're acting like you feel better.

214
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,100
Three scoops of chocolate ice cream for Tim coming up.

215
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:34,100
Hi, Carl.

216
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,100
How you doing?

217
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,100
I know it hurts.

218
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,100
But it'll be better tomorrow.

219
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
In the meantime, what would you like?

220
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Surprise.

221
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
A surprise?

222
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,100
I promised you a surprise, didn't I?

223
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,100
And it wasn't just ice cream, was it?

224
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,100
Your birthday is tomorrow, isn't it?

225
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Well, maybe, just maybe,

226
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
there will be a surprise.

227
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,100
But first you have to smile.

228
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,100
I just want to see one smile from you.

229
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,100
No smile, no surprise.

230
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,100
That's the deal.

231
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,100
No smile, no surprise.

232
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,100
If you want a surprise,

233
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
then you've got to smile first.

234
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:46,100
How are you all doing?

235
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
Well, I'm glad you're feeling better

236
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,100
because we have a little surprise for you today.

237
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
It's Carl's birthday,

238
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,100
and we have Popo the Clown to entertain you.

239
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,100
And here he is--Popo the Clown.

240
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Happy birthday, Carl.
Happy birthday.

241
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
All right, everybody.

242
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
OK, Carl.

243
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,100
It's your birthday.

244
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,100
What 's your wish?

245
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,100
What would you like?

246
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
Hmm?

247
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,100
You want to play charades?
