Episode 08 - You're Going to Be Fine

3
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:55,980
Molly, I need your special talent for handling special matters.

4
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,560
Like what special matters?

5
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,620
Well, I have a scheduling problem.

6
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,860
Yes?

7
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,360
I have three tonsillectomies set for Friday with Dr. Earl.

8
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,420
Yes?

9
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,280
I need to fit a fourth operation into his schedule.

10
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,660
And... I know you can do it.

11
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,220
Who's the patient?

12
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,680
Carl Herrera.

13
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,340
The boy has infected tonsils,

14
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,180
and we should remove them as soon as possible.

15
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,060
Well, I'll try to arrange the schedule, Dr. Stewart.

16
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,420
But it's not going to be easy.

17
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,220
I know you'll be able to take care of it.

18
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,860
Well, Mrs. Herrera,

19
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,240
Carl will be perfectly fine after we remove his tonsils.

20
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,020
Thank you for your reassurance, Dr. Stewart.

21
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,920
He's had so many colds and sore throats recently.

22
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,920
Well, it's a very easy operation, Carl.

23
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,120
You won't feel a thing.

24
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,100
But when do they do it?

25
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,140
This Friday.

26
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,920
But Saturday's my birthday.

27
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:00,540
Well, we could reschedule the operation, Mrs. Herrera,

28
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,060
but I don't want to put it off too long.

29
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,820
No, I think it's important to do it now.

30
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,140
We can have a birthday party for you, Carl,

31
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,520
When you come out of the hospital.

32
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,140
But it won't be on my birthday.

33
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,260
But your health is more important, Carl. Believe me.

34
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,980
I don't want my tonsils out.

35
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,720
Nurse Baker, would you come in, please?

36
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,120
Hello, Mrs. Herrera. Hi, Carl, how you doing?

37
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,900
I don't want my tonsils out.

38
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,100
Come with me, Carl.

39
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,500
You and I will talk this over.

40
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,220
She has a special way with kids.

41
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,780
She sure does.

42
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,520
Carl, does your throat hurt?

43
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,520
Yes.

44
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,200
OK. Do you want to get better?

45
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,100
Yes.

46
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,500
OK. We want you to get better, too.

47
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,980
You'll have your tonsils out tomorrow,

48
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,920
and you won't get so many colds anymore.

49
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,580
But if I have my tonsils out tomorrow,

50
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,340
I'll miss my birthday party on Saturday.

51
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,980
I know.

52
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,840
It's a problem, isn't it?

53
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,460
Let me try to work something out.

54
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,620
What?

55
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,920
I have to think about it.

56
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,700
You're fooling me.

57
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,640
Oh, I'm not, Carl.

58
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,840
Give me a chance to think about it,

59
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,980
and I'll come up with something.

60
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,300
A surprise?

61
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,080
Maybe.

62
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,340
But you just put on your pajamas and robe,

63
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,200
and I'll think of a surprise.

64
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,140
Will it hurt?

65
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,040
No.

66
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,420
There are other boys and girls here,

67
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,780
and they're having their tonsils out.

68
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,740
You'll meet them.

69
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,700
I don't want to.

70
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,380
Change your clothes, Carl.

71
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,320
Everything will be just fine.

72
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,260
OK.

73
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,560
Do you know how to play charades?

74
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,100
Frank, you've never played charades?

75
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,420
Nope.

76
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,660
Carl, you're sure you've never played?

77
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,040
OK, Betty, Tim, and Frank.

78
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,440
We're going to play charades.

79
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,640
Frank, you can learn as we go.

80
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,680
And, Carl, you join in at any time.

81
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,960
OK, let me think.

82
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,580
OK, I've got one.

83
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,040
All right.

84
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,720
A movie! A movie!

85
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,880
Right.

86
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,200
A movie.

87
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,740
OK.

88
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,620
Six words.

89
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,100
It has six words.

90
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,300
That's easy.

91
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,320
I can play.

92
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,860
Good. OK.

93
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,840
We've got a movie.

94
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,780
The title...

95
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,400
Six words.

96
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,140
Right.

97
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,180
First word...

98
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,560
Sounds like.

99
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,580
Sounds like...

100
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,340
You got that part right.

101
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,000
Yes.

102
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Sounds like...

103
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,040
Sounds like what?

104
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,780
Sounds like no.

105
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,060
Absolutely right, Frank.

106
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,640
Sounds like no.

107
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,120
OK.

108
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,500
We've got a movie.

109
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,440
Six words.

110
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,160
The first word sounds like no.

111
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,700
Row. Row.

112
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,160
Go.

113
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,040
Nope.

114
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,840
Show.

115
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,800
That's it - show.

116
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,920
No... OK...

117
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,360
Snow.

118
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,980
Absolutely right, Betty.

119
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,660
Sounds like no - snow.

120
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,420
OK, a movie. Six words.

121
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,360
The first word is snow.

122
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,680
This is fun.

123
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,740
Oh, OK.

124
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,000
The fifth word.

125
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,360
Right, fifth word.

126
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,900
Seven?

127
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,300
Absolutely right.

128
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:22,760
Very good.

129
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,840
The fifth word is seven.

130
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,040
OK, we've got a movie.

131
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,180
The first word is snow.

132
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,380
Fifth word, seven.

133
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,900
I got it! I got it!

134
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,080
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

135
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,200
I got it.

136
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,140
Frank, you got it.

137
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,320
Betty, you had it, but you didn't say it.

138
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,300
I knew it.

139
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,880
Carl, now you know charades.

140
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,800
Why don't you join us?

141
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,300
I don't like charades.

142
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,600
It's for babies.

143
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,960
Oh, I like it.

144
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,300
Well, they're babies.

145
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,920
You're a sore loser.

146
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,360
Yeah.

147
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,480
No arguing.

148
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,820
Save your voices.

149
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,580
Between now and tomorrow

150
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,760
you're all going to have your tonsils out.

151
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,760
And you won't be able to speak for a while.

152
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,040
So save your voices till then.

153
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,960
Hi, gang. Hi, everybody.

154
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,140
Well, what's going on?

155
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,920
I sure I am glad to see you, Dr. Stewart.

156
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,140
This is a rough group.

157
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,280
I didn't want to play charades,

158
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,300
so they're angry at me.

159
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,880
Why don't you want to play?

160
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,780
Because I don't want to be here.

161
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,640
I don't want my tonsils out.

162
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,000
Why not?

163
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,900
Because my birthday is tomorrow.

164
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,000
My mother promised me a birthday party with a clown.

165
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,440
But you can have one when you go home, Carl.

166
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,760
But my birthday is tomorrow.

167
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,480
I'm sorry, Carl.

168
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,660
Carl, you'll have your party when you go home,

169
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,180
But it won't be on my birthday!

170
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,900
And you promised me a surprise.

171
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,940
It hurts, doesn't it?

172
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,820
You'll feel better tomorrow, Betty, believe me.

173
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,380
Only one day, and it won't hurt as much.

174
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,780
Do you feel like eating?

175
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,200
Having some dinner?

176
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,860
Oh, don't look so sad.

177
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,760
Let me tell you about your dinner.

178
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,360
It's ice cream.

179
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,840
Ice cream.

180
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,560
All kinds of flavors.

181
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,620
Chocolate.

182
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,540
Strawberry?

183
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,740
Vanilla?

184
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,300
Vanilla, too?

185
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,000
I see you're feeling better already, Betty.

186
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,840
So you will have dinner?

187
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,140
OK, honey, we'll see to it

188
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,060
that you have strawberry and vanilla ice cream.

189
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,620
Just rest now.

190
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,020
You need some rest to help you get better quickly.

191
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,400
Hi, Frank.

192
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,260
How you doing?

193
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,880
Oh, come on now.

194
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,900
You're a big boy.

195
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,560
It doesn't hurt that much, does it?

196
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,280
Oh, I'm sorry it hurts so much,

197
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,820
and you won't be able to have dinner.

198
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,880
You're just going to have to have ice cream.

199
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,100
Yes, ice cream.

200
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,700
Lots of flavors.

201
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,840
Want to hear them?

202
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,240
Chocolate?

203
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,000
Then chocolate it is.

204
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,080
One scoop or two?

205
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,240
Three scoops?

206
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,260
Then three it will be.

207
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,300
You want three scoops also?

208
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,660
Chocolate, too?

209
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,740
Well, I see you're feeling better.

210
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,340
Well, at least you're acting like you feel better.

211
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Three scoops of chocolate ice cream for Tim coming up.

212
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,360
Hi, Carl.

213
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,140
How you doing?

214
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,040
I know it hurts.

215
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,080
But it'll be better tomorrow.

216
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,740
In the meantime, what would you like?

217
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,760
Surprise.

218
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,880
A surprise?

219
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,040
I promised you a surprise, didn't I?

220
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,360
And it wasn't just ice cream, was it?

221
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,320
Your birthday is tomorrow, isn't it?

222
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,920
Well, maybe, 

223
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,360
just maybe, there will be a surprise.

224
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,440
But first you have to smile.

225
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,740
I just want to see one smile from you.

226
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,240
No smile, no surprise.

227
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,800
That's the deal.

228
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,820
No smile, no surprise.

229
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,360
If you want a surprise,

230
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
then you've got to smile first.

231
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,400
How are you all doing?

232
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,740
Well, I'm glad you're feeling better

233
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,420
because we have a little surprise for you today.

234
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,920
It's Carl's birthday,

235
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,220
and we have Popo the Clown to entertain you.

236
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,880
And here he is - Popo the Clown.

237
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,340
Happy birthday, Carl. Happy birthday.

238
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,880
All right, everybody.

239
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,020
OK, Carl.

240
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,260
It's your birthday.

241
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,340
What's your wish?

242
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,460
What would you like?

243
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,900
Hmm?

244
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,540
You want to play charades?
