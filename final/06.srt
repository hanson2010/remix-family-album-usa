Episode 06 - Thanksgiving

3
00:02:04,632 --> 00:02:07,832
OK, Philip. This is your third cup of coffee.

4
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:09,888
We should get to work,

5
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,696
or we won't be finished by dinnertime.

6
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:14,912
I guess we must.

7
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:16,288
We must.

8
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:28,576
OK. The beginning of my famous Thanksgiving apple pie.

9
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:36,208
One apple. Two apples. Three apples. Four apples.

10
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:37,600
Come on, Philip!

11
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:40,280
Get busy with your famous apple pie.

12
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:41,752
There's much more to be done.

13
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:46,808
Now, the ingredients.

14
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:50,896
What goes into my apple pie besides apples?

15
00:02:51,480 --> 00:03:01,104
Ah, yes. Flour, sugar, butter.

16
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:10,232
Butter, nice and cold and hard.

17
00:03:11,712 --> 00:03:13,112
OK, here are the walnuts.

18
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,232
Last but not least,

19
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:19,112
the reason my apple pie is famous - cinnamon.

20
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:20,816
Cinnamon.

21
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:25,488
Ellen, where's the cinnamon?

22
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:27,200
If there is any cinnamon,

23
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,896
it's in the cabinet with the salt and pepper.

24
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:45,104
Salt, pepper, dill weed, garlic powder, cinnamon. Ellen?

25
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,160
Yes, Philip.

26
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:49,344
Is it possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon?

27
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:56,104
Yes, it is possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon.

28
00:03:56,984 --> 00:04:00,160
Well, how can I make my famous apple pie without cinnamon?

29
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,784
Good morning.

30
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,176
Oh, hi, Robbie. Good morning.

31
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,648
Good morning. Robbie.

32
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:07,936
Can you do me a favor?

33
00:04:08,056 --> 00:04:09,128
Sure, Dad. What?

34
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,488
Remember my apple pie on Thanksgiving?

35
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,376
What do you love about it?

36
00:04:17,448 --> 00:04:18,480
The apples?

37
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,296
No. The sssss...

38
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:21,712
Cinnamon!

39
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:25,520
Right. We don't have any cinnamon.

40
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,928
I'll go down to Henry's grocery. He's always open.

41
00:04:28,944 --> 00:04:29,936
I'll get some for you.

42
00:04:30,064 --> 00:04:31,360
That's my boy!

43
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,664
Oh, put your heavy jacket on, Robbie.

44
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:35,616
It's cold outside.

45
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:41,456
Alexandra might call.

46
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:43,400
Tell her I'll call her right back.

47
00:04:43,464 --> 00:04:44,248
OK.

48
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:46,424
Thanks, Son.

49
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:54,136
Uh, why does he always have to slam the door?

50
00:05:05,816 --> 00:05:11,064
Hello... Hello, Alexandra. How are you? Fine.

51
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:13,128
Robbie just went to the store.

52
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:14,248
He'll be back soon.

53
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:15,386
He said he'll call you.

54
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:21,297
Oh, oh, I see... Oh... certainly.

55
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:24,231
Well, do you have the phone number there?

56
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,360
Oh... I see... Please, I know he wants to talk to you...

57
00:05:30,408 --> 00:05:31,386
Thank you,

58
00:05:31,404 --> 00:05:34,408
and happy Thanksgiving to you and your family, too.

59
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:38,426
Try to come by later for dessert. Bye.

60
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:42,213
That was Alexandra.

61
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,653
She and the Molinas

62
00:05:43,653 --> 00:05:45,715
are going to spend Thanksgiving with their cousins.

63
00:05:45,964 --> 00:05:47,520
She doesn't have the phone number.

64
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:50,480
Oh, Robbie will be disappointed.

65
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:51,911
He'll be grouchy.

66
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,146
Maybe she'll call back. She promised.

67
00:05:58,133 --> 00:05:59,324
Here's your cinnamon, Pop.

68
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:07,991
It was a dollar and sixty cents.

69
00:06:11,395 --> 00:06:13,866
You forgot to ask me for the change.

70
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:17,706
Or did you forget to give it to me?

71
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:25,617
Thanks, Son.

72
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:29,511
Alexandra called.

73
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:30,675
I'll call her back.

74
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:32,302
She said she'll call you later.

75
00:06:32,311 --> 00:06:33,600
She's not at home.

76
00:06:44,435 --> 00:06:46,231
You should have your breakfast, Son.

77
00:06:46,293 --> 00:06:47,324
Make you feel better.

78
00:06:47,697 --> 00:06:49,537
Protein, vitamins.

79
00:06:49,724 --> 00:06:51,608
She said she'll call back?

80
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,648
Yes, she did.

81
00:06:54,177 --> 00:06:55,484
Good morning, everyone!

82
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:57,217
Happy Turkey Day!

83
00:06:59,004 --> 00:06:59,920
What's wrong?

84
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:02,337
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

85
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:07,208
What's gotten into him?

86
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,146
He missed a phone call.

87
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:10,933
From...?

88
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:12,284
Yes, Alexandra.

89
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:19,155
It's nice to see young love... Oh, to be young again!

90
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:20,648
Where's the coffee?

91
00:09:56,488 --> 00:09:59,022
I love parades.

92
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:03,146
The Thanksgiving Day parade is always such great fun.

93
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,146
Look at that Superman balloon!

94
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:13,626
Wowee! Just floating along high above Central Park West.

95
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:15,048
Don't you just love it?

96
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:18,773
Oh, and the bands and the music.

97
00:10:18,888 --> 00:10:20,257
John Philip Sousa.

98
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:21,875
I love his music.

99
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:30,462
Da dada da, da dada da, dada da da la dada da.

100
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:32,586
Oh, look at that float, Robbie.

101
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:35,191
Look at those funny-looking clowns.

102
00:10:35,422 --> 00:10:36,817
It's for kids.

103
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:41,493
Maybe so, but parades always make me feel like a kid.

104
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:45,377
Remember when you and your dad and I

105
00:10:45,475 --> 00:10:47,715
went to the Thanksgiving Day parade?

106
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:51,813
You were four or five years old, I think.

107
00:10:57,111 --> 00:10:58,924
Hello, hello...

108
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:02,160
Oh, hi, Susan. How are you?

109
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:04,417
Here's Mom.

110
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:08,711
Hello, Susan.

111
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,035
Yes, he missed a phone call from Alexandra.

112
00:11:12,124 --> 00:11:15,102
Yes, I know, but he'll get over it.

113
00:11:15,395 --> 00:11:18,248
Good. Then you'll be here about five?

114
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,271
Oh, fine.

115
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:22,711
I look forward to seeing you and Harry and Michelle.

116
00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:24,977
Drive carefully.

117
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:26,337
Good-bye.

118
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:29,128
Taste Ellen's turkey dressing.

119
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:30,613
It's delicious.

120
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:32,515
I'm not surprised.

121
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:33,973
It's Grandma's recipe.

122
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,706
It's my favorite part of the meal.

123
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:37,902
What about my famous apple pie?

124
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,440
Dad, your apple pie is my favorite dessert.

125
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:42,951
How's the parade?

126
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:43,724
OK.

127
00:11:54,284 --> 00:11:56,222
Mom! Is it for me?

128
00:11:56,293 --> 00:11:57,706
No, Robbie.

129
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,031
Who was it?

130
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:01,777
Wrong number.

131
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:04,426
Philip, would you join me in the kitchen, please?

132
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,040
It's getting late.

133
00:12:05,075 --> 00:12:06,817
We have vegetables to prepare.

134
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:08,026
Can I help with anything?

135
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:08,524
No, honey.

136
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:09,964
You just relax with Grandpa.

137
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:11,920
I'll get you to help serve later.

138
00:12:13,377 --> 00:12:16,133
Ellen reminds me so much of Grandma.

139
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:18,151
What time does the Michigan football game come on?

140
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:18,995
Four.

141
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:20,017
Philip!

142
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,533
I'll be back to see the game.

143
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:28,071
Grandpa, when did Dad graduate from Michigan?

144
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:30,195
Let me think.

145
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:33,928
He graduated from medical school in 1960

146
00:12:34,364 --> 00:12:38,444
and from the University of Michigan in 1956.

147
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,560
Did you go to Michigan, too, Grandpa?

148
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:44,728
Yup. I graduated in 1937.

149
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,262
I've got to start thinking about college soon.

150
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,391
OK, everybody.

151
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:48,115
I want to welcome Harry and his daughter Michelle

152
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:49,253
to Thanksgiving with us.

153
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,826
Thank you, Dr. Stewart.

154
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:51,911
Call me Philip.

155
00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:52,355
OK.

156
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,942
But first, I think we should take a moment

157
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:57,573
and remember the meaning of Thanksgiving.

158
00:15:57,662 --> 00:16:00,542
Philip, I took Michelle to a school play

159
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,706
about the first Thanksgiving.

160
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:04,355
Well, why don't you tell us about that, Michelle?

161
00:16:04,444 --> 00:16:06,657
Thanksgiving was about the Pilgrims,

162
00:16:06,702 --> 00:16:08,284
the first settlers in America.

163
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:10,666
They shared the first harvest with the Indians

164
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:11,768
and gave thanks.

165
00:16:11,813 --> 00:16:13,457
All right.

166
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,737
Then in that spirit let each of us give thanks.

167
00:16:16,764 --> 00:16:18,728
Each in his own way.

168
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,062
Who wants to begin?

169
00:16:20,222 --> 00:16:21,653
I will.

170
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:27,146
I give thanks for being here with my family and for being well,

171
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,746
so I can enjoy you all.

172
00:16:28,773 --> 00:16:30,106
All right!

173
00:16:30,177 --> 00:16:32,142
We love you, Grandpa.

174
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:39,315
I'd like to give thanks for a healthy year, a good job,

175
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:42,000
and for meeting Harry and Michelle.

176
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,111
We'd like to give thanks for meeting Susan

177
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,471
and the Stewart family.

178
00:16:46,515 --> 00:16:48,142
I love you, Daddy.

179
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:49,342
Thanks, Harry.

180
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,960
That was very kind of you.

181
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,586
I'd like to give thanks for Grandpa coming to live with us.

182
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,968
And I'd also like to thank my math teacher

183
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,004
for giving me a passing grade.

184
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:02,924
And call me, Alexandra.

185
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:04,711
Oh, Robbie!

186
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:06,035
She'll call.

187
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,017
You go first, Marilyn.

188
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:09,297
I'm thinking.

189
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:10,560
You go first.

190
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,426
Well, you all know I'm working on my photo album.

191
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:18,346
It's not finished yet.

192
00:17:18,586 --> 00:17:22,275
And I'd like to thank Marilyn for being so patient.

193
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:24,026
Thanks, Richard.

194
00:17:24,204 --> 00:17:26,293
I should thank you for encouraging me

195
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,497
to keep working on my fashion designs.

196
00:17:28,702 --> 00:17:31,697
I'm lucky to have a husband with an artistic eye.

197
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:37,448
Oh, we have a lot to be thankful for.

198
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:40,026
For the food on this table.

199
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:41,440
Just like the Pilgrims.

200
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:43,617
I'll go along with that, Ellen.

201
00:17:44,142 --> 00:17:46,560
Well, help me serve, Robbie.

202
00:17:49,893 --> 00:17:51,564
It was a wonderful meal, Mrs. Stewart.

203
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:52,106
Thank you.

204
00:17:52,222 --> 00:17:54,311
And now to see the end of the football game.

205
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:55,680
Exactly.

206
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,511
Where are you going, Philip?

207
00:17:57,831 --> 00:17:59,751
Remember, the Michigan football game?

208
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:02,000
And Michigan needs a touchdown.

209
00:18:02,577 --> 00:18:03,653
Did you forget something?

210
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,897
Dad, your famous apple pie.

211
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,942
Just let me see the score, Ellen.

212
00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:10,364
Go ahead, Philip.

213
00:18:10,391 --> 00:18:13,146
We should all take a little break before dessert.

214
00:18:25,031 --> 00:18:26,524
Oh, who could that be?

215
00:18:26,542 --> 00:18:29,102
Oh, it must be Alexandra.

216
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,448
I invited her to come by for dessert.

217
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:32,693
You did?

218
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:33,893
I like Ellen.

219
00:18:33,928 --> 00:18:35,440
You know everyone, Alexandra.

220
00:18:35,484 --> 00:18:38,915
No, she doesn't know Harry Bennett and his daughter Michelle.

221
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,875
Nice to meet you.

222
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,568
Hi.

223
00:18:41,093 --> 00:18:42,808
Hello, Alexandra.

224
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:43,546
Hi, Marilyn.

225
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:44,257
Hi, Susan.

226
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:45,422
Happy Thanksgiving.

227
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:48,088
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie.

228
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:50,204
Please sit down, Alexandra.

229
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,244
Dad, Richard, Alexandra's here.

230
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,391
Michigan needs a touchdown.

231
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,386
Three minutes to play.

232
00:18:57,475 --> 00:18:58,933
Hi, Alexandra. Welcome.

233
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:00,462
Hello, Alexandra.

234
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,177
Yes, Michigan needs a touchdown.

235
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:05,324
One tiny little touchdown, with just three minutes to play.

236
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:06,942
You want Michigan to win.

237
00:19:06,986 --> 00:19:08,231
How'd you guess?

238
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:11,404
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie.

239
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,071
What happened?

240
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:26,782
We forgot to turn the oven on.

241
00:19:28,044 --> 00:19:29,182
We did?

242
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:32,960
Philip, why don't you go

243
00:19:32,986 --> 00:19:35,004
watch the last three minutes of the game.

244
00:19:35,031 --> 00:19:38,071
I will serve coffee and pumpkin pie.

245
00:19:38,355 --> 00:19:41,235
OK. I'll be back in a few minutes.

246
00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:44,720
Robbie, would you bring the dessert plates.

247
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:46,355
And, Marilyn, would you pour coffee, please.

248
00:19:46,382 --> 00:19:47,466
Sure, Ellen.

249
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:53,848
How was your Thanksgiving dinner, Alexandra?

250
00:19:53,884 --> 00:19:55,466
Just wonderful, Mr. Stewart.

251
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:57,760
The Molinas are a large family.

252
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,368
I love being with them.

253
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:00,880
I'm glad you came by, Alexandra.

254
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:01,982
I am, too.

255
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,048
Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!

256
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:12,577
Great Thanksgiving.

257
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:14,924
Lots to be thankful for.

258
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:17,244
Michigan scored a touchdown.

259
00:20:17,528 --> 00:20:19,671
Alexandra came by.

260
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:23,360
And nobody misses Philip's famous apple pie.

261
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:25,626
Oh, Grandpa!
