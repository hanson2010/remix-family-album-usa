Episode 06 - Thanksgiving

3
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,600
OK, Philip. This is your third cup of coffee.

4
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,600
We should get to work,

5
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
or we won't be finished by dinnertime.

6
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,600
I guess we must.

7
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
We must.

8
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:15,600
OK. The beginning of my famous Thanksgiving apple pie.

9
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,600
One apple. Two apples. Three apples. Four apples.

10
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Come on, Philip!

11
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Get busy with your famous apple pie.

12
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
There's much more to be done.

13
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Now, the ingredients.

14
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,600
What goes into my apple pie besides apples?

15
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Ah, yes. Flour, sugar, butter.

16
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Butter, nice and cold and hard.

17
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
OK, here are the walnuts.

18
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Last but not least,

19
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,600
the reason my apple pie is famous--cinnamon.

20
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Cinnamon ...

21
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Ellen, where's the cinnamon? Ellen

22
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
If there is any cinnamon,

23
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
it's in the cabinet with the salt and pepper.

24
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Salt, pepper, dill weed, garlic powder, cinnamon. Ellen?

25
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Yes, Philip.

26
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Is it possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon?

27
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Yes, it is possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon.

28
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Well, how can I make my famous apple pie without cinnamon?

29
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Good morning.

30
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Oh, hi, Robbie. Good morning.

31
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Good morning. Robbie.

32
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Can you do me a favor?

33
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Sure, Dad. What?

34
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Remember my apple pie on Thanksgiving?

35
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,600
What do you love about it?

36
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
The apples?

37
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
No. The sssss...

38
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Right. We don't have any cinnamon.

39
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
I'll go down to Henry's grocery. He's always open.

40
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
I'll get some for you.

41
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
That's my boy!

42
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Oh, put your heavy jacket on, Robbie.

43
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
It's cold outside.

44
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Alexandra might call. Alexandra

45
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Tell her I'll call her right back.

46
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
OK.

47
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Thanks, Son.

48
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Uh, why does he always have to slam the door?

49
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Hello.... Hello, Alexandra. How are you? ... Fine.

50
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Robbie just went to the store. Robbie

51
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
He'll be back soon.

52
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
He said he'll call you.

53
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,600
... Oh, oh, I see.... Oh ... certainly.

54
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Well, do you have the phone number there?

55
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,600
... Oh ... I see.... Please, I know he wants to talk to you....

56
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Thank you,

57
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,600
and happy Thanksgiving to you and your family, too.

58
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Try to come by later for dessert.... Bye.

59
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,600
That was Alexandra.

60
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
She and the Molinas

61
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
are going to spend Thanksgiving with their cousins.

62
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
She doesn't have the phone number.

63
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Oh, Robbie will be disappointed.

64
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
He'll be grouchy.

65
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Maybe she'll call back. She promised.

66
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Here's your cinnamon, Pop.

67
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:54,600
It was a dollar and sixty cents.

68
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,600
You forgot to ask me for the change.

69
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Or did you forget to give it to me?

70
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Thanks, Son.

71
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Alexandra called. Alexandra

72
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
I'll call her back.

73
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
She said she'll call you later.

74
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
She's not at home.

75
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:33,600
You should have your breakfast, Son.

76
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Make you feel better.

77
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Protein, vitamins.

78
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
She said she'll call back?

79
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Yes, she did.

80
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Good morning, everyone!

81
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Happy Turkey Day!

82
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,600
What's wrong?

83
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

84
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,600
What's gotten into him?

85
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
He missed a phone call.

86
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
From ...?

87
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Yes, Alexandra.

88
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:06,600
It's nice to see young love.... Oh, to be young again!

89
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Where's the coffee?

90
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,100
I love parades.

91
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,100
The Thanksgiving Day parade is always such great fun.

92
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,100
Look at that Superman balloon!

93
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:52,100
Wowee! Just floating along high above Central Park West.

94
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,100
Don't you just love it?

95
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,100
Oh, and the bands and the music.

96
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
John Philip Sousa. John Philip Soussa

97
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
I love his music.

98
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:07,100
Da dada da da dada da da da da da da dada.

99
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Oh, look at that float, Robbie.

100
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Look at those funny-looking clowns.

101
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
It's for kids.

102
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Maybe so, but parades always make me feel like a kid.

103
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Remember when you and your dad and I

104
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,100
went to the Thanksgiving Day parade?

105
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,100
You were four or five years old, I think.

106
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:39,100
Hello, hello.... Oh, hi, Susan.

107
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,100
How are you?... Here's Mom.

108
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,100
Hello, Susan.

109
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Yes, he missed a phone call from Alexandra.

110
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Yes, I know, but he'll get over it.

111
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,100
Good. Then you'll be here about five?

112
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Oh, fine.

113
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,100
I look forward to seeing you and Harry and Michelle.

114
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
Drive carefully.

115
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Good-bye.

116
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,100
Taste Ellen's turkey dressing.

117
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,100
It's delicious.

118
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
I'm not surprised.

119
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,100
It's Grandma's recipe.

120
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
It's my favorite part of the meal.

121
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,100
What about my famous apple pie?

122
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Dad, your apple pie is my favorite dessert.

123
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,100
How's the parade?

124
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
OK.

125
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Mom! Is it for me?

126
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,100
No, Robbie.

127
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Who was it?

128
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Wrong number.

129
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Philip, would you join me in the kitchen, please? Philip

130
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
It's getting late.

131
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,100
We have vegetables to prepare.

132
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,100
Can I help with anything?

133
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
No, honey.

134
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
You just relax with Grandpa.

135
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
I'll get you to help serve later.

136
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Ellen reminds me so much of Grandma. Ellen

137
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
What time does the Michigan football game come on? Michigan

138
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,100
Four.

139
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,100
Philip! Philip

140
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,100
I'll be back to see the game.

141
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Grandpa, when did Dad graduate from Michigan?

142
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
Let me think.

143
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,100
He graduated from medical school in 1960

144
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,100
and from the University of Michigan in 1956.

145
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Did you go to Michigan, too, Grandpa?

146
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,100
Yup. I graduated in 1937.

147
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:31,100
I've got to start thinking about college soon.

148
00:14:38,100 --> 00:15:02,100
OK, everybody.

149
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,100
I want to welcome Harry and his daughter Michelle

150
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
to Thanksgiving with us.

151
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
Thank you, Dr. Stewart.

152
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Call me Philip.

153
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
OK.

154
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
But first, I think we should take a moment

155
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
and remember the meaning of Thanksgiving.

156
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,100
Philip, I took Michelle to a school play Philip

157
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,100
about the first Thanksgiving.

158
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Well, why don't you tell us about that, Michelle?

159
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
Thanksgiving was about the Pilgrims,

160
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,100
the first settlers in America.

161
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
They shared the first harvest with the Indians

162
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,100
and gave thanks.

163
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
All right.

164
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,100
Then in that spirit let each of us give thanks.

165
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Each in his own way.

166
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
Who wants to begin?

167
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,100
I will.

168
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:45,100
I give thanks for being here with my family and for being well,

169
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,100
so I can enjoy you all.

170
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
All rihgt!

171
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,100
We love you, Grandpa.

172
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:57,100
I'd like to give thanks for a healthy year, a good job,

173
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,100
and for meeting Harry and Michelle.

174
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,100
We'd like to give thanks for meeting Susan

175
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,100
and the Stewart family.

176
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,100
I love you, Daddy.

177
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Thanks, Harry.

178
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100
That was very kind of you.

179
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,100
I'd like to give thanks for Grandpa coming to live with us.

180
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,100
And I'd also like to thank my math teacher

181
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
for giving me a passing grade.

182
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,100
And call me, Alexandra.

183
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,100
Oh, Robbie!

184
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,100
She'll call.

185
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
You go first, Marilyn.

186
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,100
I'm thinking.

187
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,100
You go first.

188
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Well, you all know I'm working on my photo album.

189
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
It's not finished yet.

190
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,100
And I'd like to thank Marilyn for being so patient.

191
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,100
Thanks, Richard.

192
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
I should thank you for encouraging me

193
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100
to keep working on my fashion designs.

194
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,100
I'm lucky to have a husband with an artistic eye.

195
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Oh, we have a lot to be thankful for.

196
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,100
For the food on this table.

197
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,100
Just like the Pilgrims.

198
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,100
I'll go along with that, Ellen.

199
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Well, help me serve, Robbie.

200
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:09,100
It was a wonderful meal, Mrs. Stewart.

201
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,100
Thank you.

202
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
And now to see the end of the football game.

203
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,100
Exactly.

204
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Where are you going, Philip?

205
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,100
Remember, the Michigan football game?

206
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,100
And Michigan needs a touchdown. Michigan

207
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,100
Did you forget something?

208
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
Dad, your famous apple pie.

209
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,100
Just let me see the score, Ellen.

210
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,100
Go ahead, Philip.

211
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
We should all take a little break before dessert.

212
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Oh, who could that be?

213
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Oh, it must be Alexandra.

214
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
I invited her to come by for dessert.

215
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
You did?

216
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,100
I like Ellen.

217
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
You know everyone, Alexandra.

218
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,100
No, she doesn't know Harry Bennett and his daughter Michelle.

219
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,100
Nice to meet you.

220
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,100
Hi.

221
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Hi.

222
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,100
Hello, Alexandra.

223
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
Hi, Marilyn.

224
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,500
Hi, Susan.

225
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,100
Happy Thanksgiving.

226
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,100
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie. Alexandra

227
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,100
Please sit down, Alexandra.

228
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,100
Dad, Richard--Alexandra's here.

229
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
Michigan needs a touchdown. Michigan

230
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
Three minutes to play.

231
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Hi, Alexandra. Welcome.

232
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,100
Hello, Alexandra.

233
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
Yes, Michigan needs a touchdown.

234
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,100
One tiny little touchdown, with just three minutes to play.

235
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
You want Michigan to win.

236
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,100
How'd you guess?

237
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,100
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie. Alexandra

238
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:42,100
What happened?

239
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,100
We forgot to turn the oven on.

240
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,100
We did?

241
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100
Philip, why don't you go Philip

242
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
watch the last three minutes of the game.

243
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,100
I will serve coffee and pumpkin pie.

244
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,100
OK. I'll be back in a few minutes.

245
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Robbie, would you bring the dessert plates. Robbie

246
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
And, Marilyn, would you pour coffee, please. Marilyn

247
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
Sure, Ellen.

248
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:11,100
How was your Thanksgiving dinner, Alexandra?

249
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
Just wonderful, Mr. Stewart.

250
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,100
The Molinas are a large family. Molina

251
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,101
I love being with them.

252
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,102
I'm glad you came by, Alexandra.

253
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,103
I am, too.

254
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:28,104
Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!

255
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,105
Great Thanksgiving.

256
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,106
Lots to be thankful for.

257
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,107
Michigan scored a touchdown. Michigan

258
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,108
Alexandra came by. Alexandra

259
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,109
And nobody misses Philip's famous apple pie.

260
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,110
Oh, Grandpa!
