Episode 07 - Man's Best Friend

3
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,260
Robbie, this new Walkman is absolutely wonderful.

4
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,800
Richard and Marilyn bought it for me for my birthday.

5
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,000
They're so thoughtful.

6
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,100
You are very lucky, Robbie, to have such a nice family.

7
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,940
Is something wrong, Alexandra?

8
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,180
No, nothing.

9
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,840
Yes, there is.

10
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,900
I can tell.

11
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,360
What's the matter?

12
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,140
Come on, you can tell me.

13
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,960
What's up?

14
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,660
I don't know.

15
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,280
Something's wrong.

16
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,380
OK, let's talk.

17
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,900
I received a letter from my parents this morning.

18
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,640
Did they write some bad news?

19
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,720
No.

20
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,640
Well, then why are you so sad?

21
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,120
I miss them.

22
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,240
I miss them very much.

23
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,340
I'm sorry, Alexandra.

24
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,900
But I understand.

25
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,060
The Molinas treat me so nicely,

26
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,600
and I love being with your family so much...

27
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,760
but when I received the letter

28
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,000
with photographs of my family, I cried.

29
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,300
I cried because I miss them all.

30
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,680
You really miss your family, don't you?

31
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,360
Yes. I know I must seem silly.

32
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,340
It's not like I have nobody.

33
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,080
I like the Molinas very much,

34
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,000
and they're so kind to me.

35
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,420
Hey, why don't we go out

36
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,220
for a cheeseburger and french fries?

37
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,740
That'll cheer you up.

38
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,420
And you can use my Walkman.

39
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,300
That's a good idea.

40
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,220
But if we go out,

41
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,600
please don't complain

42
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,400
about your math teacher or your math homework.

43
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,720
I want to have fun.

44
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,080
So do I.

45
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,060
I have to turn off the lights,

46
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,320
or else my father will get really angry.

47
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,020
He says I never turn them out when I leave.

48
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,900
If they come home and they're on...

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,600
Do you hear something?

50
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,020
Yes. What was that?
Do you hear something?

51
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,560
Yes. What was that?

52
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,820
It sounded like a dog barking.

53
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,080
It sounded like a dog barking right here.

54
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,220
Yeah.

55
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,300
A dog!

56
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,200
A springer spaniel!

57
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,340
Come on in!

58
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,320
Make yourself at home.

59
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,040
Oh, you poor little thing.

60
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,600
Come here.

61
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,420
Come on.

62
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,200
Poor baby.

63
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,980
Where did you come from?

64
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,080
Her name's Gemma,

65
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,720
and she belongs to Mr. and Mrs. Levinson.

66
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,320
There's a phone number

67
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,660
555-8448.

68
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,920
Robbie, maybe you should call them

69
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,600
and tell the Levinsons we have their cute little spaniel.

70
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,920
I've always wanted a springer spaniel.

71
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,220
She's so cute.

72
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:21,420
The number you are calling "555-8448"

73
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,960
is no longer in service.

74
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,700
The number's no longer in service.

75
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,240
Oh, you poor, poor baby.

76
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,020
You've lost your family.

77
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,400
We'll find them.

78
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,920
Don't worry, Alexandra.

79
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,920
Don't worry, Alexandra.

80
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,880
We'll find the owner.

81
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,500
How, Robbie?

82
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,920
Let me think.

83
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,560
Gemma, sit.

84
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,760
Good Gemma.

85
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,780
Give me your paw.

86
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,540
Good Gemma.

87
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,140
This dog is well trained.

88
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,460
She likes you, too.

89
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,640
So how are we going to find the owners?

90
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,580
With a little help from the ASPCA,

91
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,680
the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

92
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,780
They're the ones.

93
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,400
We once found a cat.

94
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,620
She was caught in the branches of our tree.

95
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,440
And Dad called the ASPCA.

96
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,040
They came and solved the problem.

97
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,900
Robbie, let's call them.

98
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,760
Let me see. ASPCA...

99
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,460
Here it is.

100
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,620
ASPCA Animal Shelter,

101
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,720
555-7700.

102
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,860
Hello, ASPCA.

103
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,620
Hello, my name is Robbie Stewart.

104
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,960
I have a lost dog I'd like to bring to you.

105
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,100
How late are you open?

106
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,860
We're open till nine P.M.

107
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,760
Thank you.

108
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,480
I'll bring the dog over by nine.

109
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:47,980
Thanks.

110
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,860
Bye.

111
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,040
Thanks.

112
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,760
Good-bye.

113
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,600
They're still open?

114
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,120
They're open until nine o'clock.

115
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,760
We have two and a half hours.

116
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,900
Let's take Gemma by there now.

117
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,880
They'll find the owner.

118
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,540
I hope so.

119
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,960
I'm so sad to see this little dog without her family.

120
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,080
I'm sure they'll find the owner.

121
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,900
But if they don't, I'll adopt her.

122
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,980
She's so cute.

123
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,860
Look at those eyes.

124
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,660
She's hard to resist.

125
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,980
Don't you just love her?

126
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,180
I'd like to keep her, too.

127
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,960
But I'll be going home to Greece

128
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,540
at the end of the semester.

129
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,960
She just wants love and affection.

130
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,320
Come on, Robbie.

131
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,800
Let's get her to the animal shelter,

132
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,120
so they can find her owners quickly.

133
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,180
Don't worry, Gemma.

134
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,520
We'll get you home.

135
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,860
It's not easy being away from home.

136
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,640
Come on, poochie.

137
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,120
Atta girl!

138
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,320
Let's go.

139
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,440
We're off to the animal shelter.

140
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,780
Your name?

141
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,120
Robbie Stewart.

142
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,380
And this is Alexandra Pappas.

143
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,800
Your name will do, Mr. Stewart.

144
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,800
Your address?

145
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,180
46 Linden Street, Riverdale.

146
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,200
Where did you find the dog?

147
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,640
She found us.

148
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,840
You tried calling the number on the collar?

149
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,340
Yes, but the number's no longer in service.

150
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,580
And there's no address on the dog tag?

151
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,320
There's no other information.

152
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,660
No ID number.

153
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,460
Without that, it's hard.

154
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,980
You will try to find the dog's owner.

155
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,320
Oh, we'll try, believe me.

156
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,380
And if you don't?

157
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,800
Yes?

158
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,840
If you don't... can I... can I adopt the dog?

159
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,080
Why, yes.

160
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,120
If the owners don't claim the dog in 48 hours,

161
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,760
then you can apply for adoption.

162
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,180
How do I do that?

163
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,560
You really want to?

164
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,420
Yes, I'm serious.

165
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,460
If no one comes to claim Gemma,

166
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,880
I'd like to adopt her.

167
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,400
It's not difficult.

168
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,120
OK.

169
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,660
If you want to adopt an animal,

170
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,080
first we need to know some references.

171
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,340
References?

172
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,300
People we know?

173
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,120
Friends, teachers...

174
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,560
We need to talk to some people about you.

175
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,040
We want to be sure that you're responsible

176
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,180
and that you can take good care of an animal.

177
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Then you have to fill out this form

178
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,920
about your family background.

179
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,340
Is that it?

180
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,120
No, there's more.

181
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,120
We need to know about your history with animals.

182
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,620
Have you ever owned an animal?

183
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,720
Yes.

184
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,600
We had a cat when I was eight years old.

185
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,920
I love cats.

186
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,940
Do you have any animals now?

187
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,960
Unfortunately, no.

188
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,700
Anything else?

189
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,260
We also like to know

190
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,080
your reasons for wanting an animal.

191
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,560
Just to hold it and cuddle with it.

192
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,360
Just to have as a pet.

193
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,760
I love animals.

194
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,660
To have a friend - a pal.

195
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,560
You know, man's best friend is his dog.

196
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,140
And one thing more.

197
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,060
If you're under 21 years of age...

198
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,840
That's me.

199
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,560
Then an adult must sign for you.

200
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,660
Uh-oh.

201
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,420
No problem.

202
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,460
My parents will think it's a good idea.

203
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,900
I'll be back with them.

204
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,800
If the real owners don't come to claim Gemma...

205
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,000
After 48 hours.

206
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,560
But please call first.

207
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,740
Thanks for your information and for being so helpful.

208
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,020
It's my pleasure.

209
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,680
Nice talking to both of you.

210
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,700
Thanks again.

211
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,260
Bye.

212
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,840
Maybe the real owners will come to claim her.

213
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,840
Her eyes look so sad.

214
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,240
She must really miss them.

215
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,400
I see you're both animal lovers.

216
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,420
We are.

217
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,980
Good-bye, Miss Aborn.

218
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,300
We'll call in a couple of days.

219
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,980
Good-bye, and thanks for bringing Gemma in.

220
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,260
Bye.

221
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,340
I keep thinking about the dog, about Gemma,

222
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,920
alone in the animal shelter.

223
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,640
I know.

224
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,680
But I promise you, Alexandra,

225
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,160
the dog is just fine.

226
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,140
They're very kind to the animals.

227
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,440
I know they are.

228
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,480
I mean about her being alone.

229
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,660
Even if they are kind to Gemma,

230
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,000
she's still alone, without her family.

231
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,600
Ready, folks?

232
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,240
Are you ready, Alexandra?

233
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,400
Yes, I'm ready.

234
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,820
I'll have the chef's salad, please.

235
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,000
I will have a cheeseburger, medium rare,

236
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,020
with raw onion, and french fries, please.

237
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,220
Anything to drink?

238
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,680
A diet cola, please.

239
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,780
Ginger ale with lots of ice for me, thank you.

240
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,580
I've got it.

241
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,280
Thanks.

242
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,440
Aren't you surprised

243
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,180
that the animal shelter is so careful

244
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,980
about finding homes for the animals?

245
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,160
No, I'm not.

246
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,980
And a cheeseburger, medium rare,

247
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,620
with onion and french fries.

248
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,000
And a ginger ale with lots of ice.

249
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,280
Salad dressing?

250
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,120
Hey, I wanted you to hear my new sound system

251
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,240
when the dog scratched on the front door.

252
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,760
Let's finish eating,

253
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,620
and then we'll go back to my house.

254
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,800
I want you to hear my new tapes.

255
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,980
I've got some great new dance music.

256
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,280
Hello.

257
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,320
Stewart residence.

258
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,240
Hello.

259
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,360
Is Robbie Stewart there?

260
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,280
This is he.

261
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,080
Who's this?

262
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,780
This is Linda Aborn from the animal shelter.

263
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,140
It's Linda from the animal shelter.

264
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,640
Yes, Linda. Hi.

265
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,380
We have good news and bad news, Robbie.

266
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:38,980
Oh?

267
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,820
The good news is that the Levinsons have come by

268
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,900
to pick up the dog.

269
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,360
The bad news is, you won't be able to adopt the dog.

270
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,340
That's OK.

271
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,540
Come by one day and look at some of the other dogs.

272
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,200
I'm sure there's one for you.

273
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,420
Thanks, Robbie.

274
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,380
And the Levinsons thank you for bringing their dog to us.

275
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,080
Thanks, Linda.

276
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,100
Bye.

277
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,120
The owners claimed Gemma?

278
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,580
That's right.

279
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,660
I'm glad for the dog.

280
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,040
I guess I am, too.

281
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,980
She said if I come by,

282
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,800
she'll help me find another dog.

283
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,660
Come on. Let's dance.

284
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,360
They come in every shape,

285
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,860
every size, and every color...

286
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,180
Long hair, and short hair, or no hair at all.

287
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,080
Some with feathers.

288
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,320
And some have fur.

289
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,740
And some will even come when you call.

290
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:58,460
I'm talking about pets in the U.S.A.

291
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,920
Pets in the U.S.A.

292
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,940
Some you can hold.

293
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,720
Some will walk by your side.

294
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,180
some you can ride every day.

295
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,800
some will shake your hand.

296
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,100
And when they get to know you,

297
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,280
they seem to understand what you say.

298
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:29,060
I'm talking about pets in the U.S.A.

299
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,700
Pets in the U.S.A.

300
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,860
No matter what they look like,

301
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,960
no matter what they are,

302
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,880
we like to think of them as our friends,

303
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,900
just like you and me.

304
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,620
They have personalities.

305
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:57,280
And they can be such good company.

306
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,960
Some live under water.

307
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,420
Some live in a cage.

308
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,900
And some can just walk around your home.

309
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,380
They may have droopy eyes.

310
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,400
They may have floppy ears.

311
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,080
But they can keep you from feeling all alone.

312
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,620
I'm talking about pets in the U.S.A.

313
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:26,060
Pets in the U.S.A.
