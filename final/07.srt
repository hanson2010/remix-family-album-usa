Episode 07 - Man's Best Friend

3
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Robbie, this new Walkman is absolutely wonderful. Robbie

4
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Richard and Marilyn bought it for me for my birthday.

5
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,600
They're so thoughtful.

6
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,600
You are very lucky, Robbie, to have such a nice family. Robbie

7
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Is something wrong, Alexandra? Alexandra

8
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
No, nothing.

9
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Yes, there is.

10
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
I can tell.

11
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
What's the matter?

12
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Come on, you can tell me.

13
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
What's up?

14
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
I don't know.

15
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Something's wrong.

16
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,600
OK, let's talk.

17
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,600
I received a letter from my parents this morning.

18
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Did they write some bad news?

19
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
No.

20
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Well, then why are you so sad?

21
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I miss them.

22
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
I miss them very much.

23
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
I'm sorry, Alexandra.

24
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
But I understand.

25
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,600
The Molinas treat me so nicely, Molina

26
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,600
and I love being with your family so much ...

27
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,600
but when I received the letter

28
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
with photographs of my family, I cried.

29
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,600
I cried because I miss them all.

30
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
You really miss your family, don't you?

31
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Yes. I know I must seem silly.

32
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
It's not like I have nobody.

33
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I like the Molinas very much,

34
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
and they're so kind to me.

35
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Hey, why don't we go out

36
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
for a cheeseburger and french fries?

37
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
That'll cheer you up.

38
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
And you can use my Walkman.

39
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
That's a good idea.

40
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
But if we go out,

41
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,600
please don't complain

42
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
about your math teacher or your math homework.

43
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
I want to have fun.

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
So do I.

45
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
I have to turn off the lights,

46
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
or else my father will get really angry.

47
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
He says I never turn them out when I leave.

48
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
If they come home and they're on ...

49
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Do you hear something?

50
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Yes.

51
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
What was that?

52
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
It sounded like a dog barking.

53
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,600
It sounded like a dog barking right here.

54
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Yeah.

55
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,600
A dog!

56
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
A springer spaniel!

57
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Come on in!

58
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Make yourself at home.

59
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Oh, you poor little thing.

60
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Come here.

61
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Come on.

62
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Poor baby.

63
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Where did you come from?

64
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Her name's Gemma,

65
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
and she belongs to Mr. and Mrs. Levinson.

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
There's a phone number --

67
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,600
five five five ... eight four four eight. 555

68
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Robbie, maybe you should call them Robbie

69
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
and tell the Levinsons we have their cute little spaniel.

70
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
I've always wanted a springer spaniel.

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
She's so cute.

72
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:20,600
The number you are calling -- 555-8448 --

73
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
is no longer in service.

74
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,600
The number's no longer in service.

75
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Oh, you poor, poor baby.

76
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
You've lost your family.

77
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
We'll find them.

78
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Don't worry, Alexandra.

79
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,100
Don't worry, Alexandra.

80
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
We'll find the owner.

81
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
How, Robbie?

82
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,100
Let me think.

83
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Gemma, sit. Gemma

84
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Good Gemma.

85
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Give me your paw.

86
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Good Gemma.

87
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
This dog is well trained.

88
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,100
She likes you, too.

89
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
So how are we going to find the owners?

90
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
With a little help from the ASPCA,

91
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,100
the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

92
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
They're the ones.

93
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
We once found a cat.

94
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
She was caught in the branches of our tree.

95
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,100
And Dad called the ASPCA.

96
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,100
They came and solved the problem.

97
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,100
Robbie, let's call them. Robbie

98
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:46,100
Let me see -- ASPCA....

99
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:52,100
Here it is.

100
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,100
ASPCA Animal Shelter. ASPCA

101
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:59,100
555-7700.

102
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:12,100
(beep...)

103
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Hello, ASPCA.

104
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,100
Hello, my name is Robbie Stewart.

105
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,100
I have a lost dog I'd like to bring to you.

106
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
How late are you open?

107
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,100
We're open till nine P.M.

108
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Thank you.

109
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
I'll bring the dog over by nine.

110
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Thanks.

111
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,100
Bye.

112
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
Thanks.

113
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,100
Good-bye.

114
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,100
They're still open?

115
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
They're open until nine o'clock.

116
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
We have two and a half hours.

117
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Let's take Gemma by there now.

118
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
They'll find the owner.

119
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
I hope so.

120
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,100
I'm so sad to see this little dog without her family.

121
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100
I'm sure they'll find the owner.

122
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,100
But if they don't, I'll adopt her.

123
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,100
She's so cute.

124
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,100
Look at those eyes.

125
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,100
She's hard to resist.

126
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Don't you just love her?

127
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,100
I'd like to keep her, too.

128
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
But I'll be going home to Greece

129
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,100
at the end of the semester.

130
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,100
She just wants love and affection.

131
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,100
Come on, Robbie.

132
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Let's get her to the animal shelter,

133
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,100
so they can find her owners quickly.

134
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,100
Don't worry, Gemma.

135
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
We'll get you home.

136
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
It's not easy being away from home.

137
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,100
Come on, poochie.

138
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,100
Atta girl!

139
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,100
Let's go.

140
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,100
We're off to the animal shelter.

141
00:11:38,100 --> 00:12:01,100
let's thank taotao

142
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Your name?

143
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Robbie Stewart. Robbie Stewart

144
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,100
And this is Alexandra Pappas.

145
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,100
Your name will do, Mr. Stewart.

146
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Your address?

147
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,100
46 Linden street, Riverdale. Riverdale

148
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Where did you find the dog?

149
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,100
She found us.

150
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,100
You tried calling the number on the collar?

151
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,100
Yes, but the number's no longer in service.

152
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,100
And there's no address on the dog tag?

153
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
There's no other information.

154
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
No ID number.

155
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,100
Without that, it's hard.

156
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,100
You will try to find the dog's owner.

157
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,100
Oh, we'll try, believe me.

158
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,100
And if you don't?

159
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Yes?

160
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,100
If you don't ... can I ... can I adopt the dog?

161
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,100
Why, yes.

162
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,100
If the owners don't claim the dog in forty-eight hours,

163
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,100
then you can apply for adoption.

164
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
How do I do that?

165
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
You really want to?

166
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,100
Yes, I'm serious.

167
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,100
If no one comes to claim Gemma,

168
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
I'd like to adopt her.

169
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,100
It's not difficult.

170
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,100
OK.

171
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,100
If you want to adopt an animal,

172
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,100
first we need to know some references.

173
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,100
References?

174
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
People we know?

175
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Friends, teachers....

176
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
We need to talk to some people about you.

177
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,100
We want to be sure that you're responsible

178
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
and that you can take good care of an animal.

179
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,100
Then you have to fill out this form

180
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,100
about your family background.

181
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,100
Is that it?

182
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
No, there's more.

183
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,100
We need to know about your history with animals.

184
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
Have you ever owned an animal?

185
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Yes.

186
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,100
We had a cat when I was eight years old.

187
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,100
I love cats.

188
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
Do you have any animals now?

189
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
Unfortunately, no.

190
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
Anything else?

191
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
We also like to know

192
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
your reasons for wanting an animal.

193
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,100
Just to hold it and cuddle with it.

194
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
Just to have as a pet.

195
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,100
I love animals.

196
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:06,100
To have a friend -- a pal.

197
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,100
You know, man's best friend is his dog.

198
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,100
And one thing more.

199
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
If you're under twenty-one years of age ...

200
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,100
That's me.

201
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
Then an adult must sign for you.

202
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Uh-oh.

203
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,100
No problem.

204
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
My parents will think it's a good idea.

205
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
I'll be back with them.

206
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
If the real owners don't come to claim Gemma ...

207
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
After forty-eight hours.

208
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
But please call first.

209
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Thanks for your information and for being so helpful.

210
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,100
It's my pleasure.

211
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Nice talking to both of you.

212
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Thanks again.

213
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Bye.

214
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,100
Maybe the real owners will come to claim her.

215
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
Her eyes look so sad.

216
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100
She must really miss them.

217
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
I see you're both animal lovers.

218
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,100
We are.

219
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,100
Good-bye, Miss Aborn.

220
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
We'll call in a couple of days.

221
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
Good-bye, and thanks for bringing Gemma in.

222
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Bye.

223
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:09,100
I keep thinking about the dog -- about Gemma,

224
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,100
alone in the animal shelter.

225
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
I know.

226
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
But I promise you, Alexandra,

227
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,100
the dog is just fine.

228
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,100
They're very kind to the animals.

229
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,100
I know they are.

230
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,100
I mean about her being alone.

231
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,100
Even if they are kind to Gemma,

232
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
she's still alone, without her family.

233
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,100
Ready, folks?

234
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,100
Are you ready, Alexandra?

235
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Yes, I'm ready.

236
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,100
I'll have the chef's salad, please.

237
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,100
I will have a cheeseburger, medium rare,

238
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,100
with raw onion, and french fries, please.

239
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Anything to drink?

240
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,100
A diet cola, please.

241
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Ginger ale with lots of ice for me, thank you.

242
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
I've got it.

243
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Thanks.

244
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Aren't you surprised

245
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,100
that the animal shelter is so careful

246
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,100
about finding homes for the animals?

247
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,100
No, I'm not.

248
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,100
And a cheeseburger, medium rare,

249
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,100
with onion and french fries.

250
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
And a ginger ale with lots of ice.

251
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Salad dressing?

252
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Hey, I wanted you to hear my new sound system

253
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
when the dog scratched on the front door.

254
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,100
and then we'll go back to my house.

255
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
I want you to hear my new tapes.

256
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
I've got some great new dance music.

257
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Hello.

258
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,100
Stewart residence. Stewart

259
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Hello.

260
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
Is Robbie Stewart there? Robbie Stewart

261
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,100
This is he.

262
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
Who's this?

263
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,100
This is Linda Aborn from the animal shelter.

264
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,100
It's Linda from the animal shelter.

265
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,100
Yes, Linda.

266
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Hi.

267
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,100
We have good news and bad news, Robbie.

268
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,100
Oh?

269
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
The good news is that the Levinsons have come by

270
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,100
to pick up the dog.

271
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,100
The bad news is, you won't be able to adopt the dog.

272
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,100
That's OK.

273
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,100
Come by one day and look at some of the other dogs.

274
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,100
I'm sure there's one for you.

275
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Thanks, Robbie.

276
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,100
And the Levinsons thank you for bringing their dog to us. Levinson

277
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,100
Thanks, Linda.

278
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,100
Bye.

279
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:25,100
The owners claimed Gemma?

280
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,100
That's right.

281
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
I'm glad for the dog.

282
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,100
I guess I am, too.

283
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,100
She said if I come by,

284
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,100
she'll help me find another dog.

285
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,100
Come on.

286
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Let's dance.
