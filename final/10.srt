Episode 10 - Smell the Flowers

3
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,860
Good morning, Susan.

4
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,780
Good morning, Sam.

5
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,960
What's the schedule today?

6
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,220
Ten o'clock,

7
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,700
telephone FAO Schwarz about the new twin baby dolls.

8
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,520
OK.

9
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,120
Telephone Mrs. Zaskey at the advertising agency.

10
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,560
I did that. Go on.

11
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,220
Eleven o'clock, approve the sketches for the toy spaceship.

12
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,260
Where are they?

13
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,200
Right here.

14
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,120
Did you look at them?

15
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,940
Yes, I did.

16
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,460
What do you think of the spaceship?

17
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,440
I think the kids will love it.

18
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,760
Would you show me the drawings, please?

19
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,880
Huh.

20
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,580
Now, what else is on the schedule today?

21
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,300
Well, at one o'clock

22
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,460
you have a lunch appointment with Mr. Levine,

23
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,260
the client from the Toytown Stores.

24
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,220
Where?

25
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,520
At Rossano's.

26
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,280
Hmm. Anything else?

27
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,300
At four o'clock,

28
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,720
you have a meeting with the production staff

29
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,880
in the conference room.

30
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,520
Make sure everybody is at that meeting.

31
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,520
Will do.

32
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,560
At six you're meeting, Mr. Ozawa.

33
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,980
Oh, yes. Are his models here?

34
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,160
They're in my office.

35
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:14,840
I'd like to see them.

36
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,360
Right.

37
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,860
What else?

38
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,240
Come on, Sam.

39
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,060
You work too hard, Susan.

40
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,200
When was your last day off?

41
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,520
Hmm. I can't remember.

42
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,820
You really ought to take some time off.

43
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,220
What for?

44
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,660
To enjoy the simple things in life...

45
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,580
I know, Sam.

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,820
Maybe soon.

47
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,360
To smell the flowers.

48
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,560
Oh, wait a minute. What's today's date?

49
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,780
Today is the twelfth. Why?

50
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,760
It seems to me I scheduled something else.

51
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,820
There's nothing else in the appointment book.

52
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,100
I'm sure I did.

53
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,620
Oh, well, I'll probably remember it later.

54
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,020
I hope it isn't important.

55
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,060
Hmm. It's probably nothing.

56
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,040
OK, let's get started.

57
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,520
Would you call Priscilla Smith at FAO Schwarz, please?

58
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,240
Right.

59
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,300
These are the models from the Japanese film maker.

60
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,580
Thank you. Just put them on my desk.

61
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,920
And the new drawings for the toy spaceship.

62
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,500
Wonderful.

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,160
That was fast.

64
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,520
We have a new artist.

65
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,700
She's very talented.

66
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,200
What time is it, anyway?

67
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,000
My watch stopped.

68
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,680
It's 11:30.

69
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,300
What time is my lunch date with Bill Levine?

70
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,520
One o'clock.

71
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,740
Remind me to leave at 12:45.

72
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,160
Did you remember your other appointment for today?

73
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,140
No,

74
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,500
but I have a feeling

75
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,280
it's going to be too late when I do remember.

76
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,380
Yes, Sam?

77
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,040
I just solved the mystery.

78
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,640
What did I forget?

79
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,300
You have some guests in the reception room.

80
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,260
What? Who?

81
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,880
Mr. Harry Bennett and his daughter.

82
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,340
I remember!

83
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,140
Oh... Harry!

84
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,300
I made a lunch date with him and his daughter weeks ago.

85
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,180
Is he a client?

86
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,320
He's a friend.

87
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,480
Well, he's here with his daughter to have lunch.

88
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,820
I met her at Thanksgiving,

89
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,140
and I promised to have lunch with both of them today.

90
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,600
Yes, indeed.

91
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,920
What are you going to do about your appointment

92
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,280
with Mr. Levine?

93
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,220
Any suggestions?

94
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,740
Oh!

95
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,600
Hi, Michelle.

96
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,640
Hello, Harry.

97
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,200
It's nice to see you again.

98
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,840
Hello.

99
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,260
Hi, Susan.

100
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,340
We have both been excited about seeing you

101
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,860
and having lunch with you today.

102
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,140
Michelle picked these flowers out for you.

103
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,280
Daddy, can we go soon?

104
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,880
We're going to go to lunch in a few minutes, honey.

105
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,700
But I'm thirsty.

106
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,120
OK. You go out and get a drink of water at the fountain.

107
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,860
The fountain is over there, Michelle.

108
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,180
Near the Exit sign.

109
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,380
Thank you.

110
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,140
Michelle is a little shy.

111
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,720
I used to be that way when I was her age.

112
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,340
Harry, if Michelle doesn't want to go,

113
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,440
we don't have to.

114
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,820
She'll be fine.

115
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,740
Remember,

116
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,860
I haven't dated any one else since her mother died.

117
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,100
This is a little difficult for her.

118
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,800
Are you ready to go?

119
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,940
Yes. But could you wait one minute?

120
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,660
I have a call to make.

121
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,500
Would you excuse me?

122
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,700
Sam, get Mr. Levine at Toytown Stores

123
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,140
on the telephone for me, please.

124
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,480
Right.

125
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,800
Hello. Susan Stewart calling Mr. Levine, please.

126
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,700
He's on the phone.

127
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,960
Mr. Levine, Susan Stewart.

128
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,920
I find myself in an embarrassing situation.

129
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,260
I made another lunch date for today

130
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,120
and forgot to enter it in my appointment book.

131
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,580
Can you and I meet for drinks tomorrow?

132
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,380
I'd really appreciate it... Yes... Thank you...

133
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,240
Tomorrow at five o'clock at the Biltmore.

134
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,260
I'll see you then.

135
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,580
Thank you, Mr. Levine.

136
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,500
Welcome to the South Street restaurant, folks.

137
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,280
What'll it be?

138
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,400
What do you recommend?

139
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Well, the crab salad's always a big hit.

140
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,040
Susan, would you like the crab salad?

141
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,600
I'd love the crab salad.

142
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,860
Michelle, would you like to try the crab salad, too?

143
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,780
OK, Daddy.

144
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,080
We'll have three crab salads

145
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,640
and a pitcher of lemonade.

146
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,220
Help yourself to celery and carrots and other vegetables.

147
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,900
We used to catch crabs.

148
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,060
Where was that?

149
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,100
We had a summer house on Fire Island.

150
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,560
Do you remember, Michelle?

151
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,180
Sure.

152
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,260
You and Mommy used to take me on the ferryboat.

153
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,740
Sometimes, at night,

154
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,280
we would go down to the beach and catch crabs,

155
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,880
remember?

156
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,380
With a piece of meat on a string!

157
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,200
Right.

158
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,340
Well, I think I'm going to go get us all some vegetables.

159
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,360
There you go.

160
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,900
Thank you.

161
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,080
And some ice-cold lemonade.

162
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,540
Thank you.

163
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,340
Enjoy it.

164
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,400
Michelle, can I help you with the lemonade?

165
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,500
No, thank you.

166
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,260
I'll wait for my father.

167
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,080
Michelle, can we have a talk?

168
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,220
Sure.

169
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,020
I know you miss your mother.

170
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,120
You do?

171
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,600
Yes. And I'm not trying to take her place.

172
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,700
Then why are you and Daddy

173
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,580
spending so much time together?

174
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,360
Because we like each other.

175
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,640
And right now, he needs a friend.

176
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,780
I'm his friend.

177
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,620
I know you are.

178
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,420
Sometimes he's very sad.

179
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,000
And so are you, I think.

180
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,860
Sometimes.

181
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,040
I'd like to be your friend, too.

182
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,120
Will you let me be your friend, Michelle?

183
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,220
So, what were you two talking about?

184
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,120
Just girl talk, Daddy.

185
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,600
It's too hard to explain.

186
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,040
You're probably right.

187
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,360
Well, let's get started.

188
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,740
Oh, it's 3:45,

189
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,940
and I have a production meeting at four.

190
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,680
I planned to take you for a ride in Central Park

191
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,380
in a horse and carriage.

192
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,740
Harry, I'd love to,

193
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,240
but I have work to do.

194
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,880
OK. We'll walk back to your office with you.

195
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,680
It's so nice out.

196
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,900
I decided to forget about my accounting problems

197
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,000
and just enjoy this beautiful spring day.

198
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,500
Take the time, Susan.

199
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,560
I know I should,

200
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,140
but... well, there are too many things to do.

201
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,100
I understand.

202
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,480
I'll go for a ride with Michelle.

203
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,340
Right.

204
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,280
Well, I had a really nice time.

205
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,360
So did I.

206
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,580
So did I.

207
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,060
I'm sorry you can't come with us, Susan.

208
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,500
So am I.

209
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,800
Bye-bye.

210
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,180
Harry! Michelle!

211
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,600
Can you wait till I make a phone call?

212
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,400
Sure.

213
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,900
Susan Stewart's office.

214
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,880
Sam, this is Susan.

215
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,240
Hi. How was lunch?

216
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,100
Fine.

217
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,860
You're late.

218
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,980
The production department's waiting in the conference room.

219
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,980
I know.

220
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,680
Ask Paul Smith to fill in for me.

221
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,680
He knows everything about the production schedule,

222
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,260
and he can answer any questions.

223
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,000
Right.

224
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,540
Don't tell any one,

225
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,400
but I'm taking a little time to smell the flowers.

226
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,680
Good for you.

227
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,540
It'll be our secret.

228
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,920
But schedule another production meeting for tomorrow.

229
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,420
I'll be back

230
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,480
for my six o'clock appointment with Mr. Ozawa.

231
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,180
OK, Susan.

232
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,440
And have a nice afternoon.

233
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,720
Thanks.

234
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,400
She likes you.

235
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,340
I know. I like her.

236
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,180
How'd you do it?

237
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,740
We had a talk.

238
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,900
About what?

239
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,940
Life.

240
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,200
And what did you decide?

241
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,560
That's a secret... between us women.
