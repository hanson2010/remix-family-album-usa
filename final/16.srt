Episode 16 - Full of Surprises

3
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,600
The mailman just dropped some mail in our box, Grandpa.

4
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Probably a lot of advertising and bills.

5
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Why don't you write to me, Robbie,

6
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
so I can get some interesting mail?

7
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:35,600
You were right, Grandpa.

8
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Advertising, bills, bills, advertising.

9
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Yes. It's just like I said, Robbie.

10
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Nothing interesting.

11
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
You won't believe it, Grandpa,

12
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
but there's a letter here addressed to you,

13
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Mr. Malcolm Stewart, and it looks like a personal letter.

14
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Oh, it must be a bill.

15
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
I don't think so.

16
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
The return name and address is

17
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Pete Waters, RFD Number 1, Chesterton.

18
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,600
You're joking. Pete Waters?

19
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Pete Waters, RFD Number 1, Chesterton.

20
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
You know him?

21
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Do I know Pete Waters?

22
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,600
You bet I do!

23
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
He was my roommate in college.

24
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:24,600
He visited with Grandma and me in Florida

25
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
about five years ago.

26
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:34,600
What does he say?

27
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Is he OK?

28
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Yeah, he's fine.

29
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Just fine.

30
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,600
He's writing to invite me

31
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
to spend a weekend with him at his farm.

32
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
He's planning a get-together

33
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
with two or three other college friends.

34
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,600
A kind of a fifty-year anniversary reunion.

35
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Sounds like fun.

36
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Fifty years? Wow!

37
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
It sounds like fun to me, too, Robbie.

38
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
What kind of farm does he have?

39
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
I've never been there, Robbie,

40
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,600
but he has chickens and cows and all.

41
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,600
That means fresh eggs and fresh milk.

42
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Does he have a family?

43
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
No, he doesn't, Robbie.

44
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
He never married.

45
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
He's not as lucky as I am

46
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
to have a family and grandchildren.

47
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm a lucky man.

48
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,600
How come he never got married?

49
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
That's a good question, Robbie.

50
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
A very good question.

51
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
He never married because

52
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
the girl he was in love with in college married someone else.

53
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
As simple as that.

54
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
He never got over it.

55
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
He must have loved her very much.

56
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Yes. Very much.

57
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Lillian Winters.

58
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
She was in our class.

59
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
And what happened?

60
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
She was in love with Donald McGrath,

61
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
the quarterback on our football team.

62
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Football players are always popular with the ladies.

63
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,600
She liked Pete, and they went to dances together.

64
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,600
But her heart was with Donald.

65
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Did he ever get over it?

66
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
No, he never did.

67
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Where is she today?

68
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
I don't know.

69
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Maybe Lillian will be at the reunion.

70
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
You think so?

71
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Pete's full of surprises.

72
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
I wish I could go there with you, Grandpa.

73
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
What do you think the surprise will be?

74
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,600
With Pete, you never know, Robbie.

75
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Won't it be exciting to see all your college friends there again?

76
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
It is already.

77
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,600
I'm kind of excited about going now.

78
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Next weekend...

79
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,600
sleep over Friday and Saturday night

80
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
and come back Sunday.

81
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,600
I can't wait!

82
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Don't you think you ought to call Pete

83
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
and tell him you're coming?

84
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
You're reading my mind, Robbie.

85
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Hello. What can I do for you?

86
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Hi. Fill 'er up.

87
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
I need a full tank.

88
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Check the hood?

89
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
No, thanks.

90
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Whereabouts are you headed?

91
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Pete Waters's farm, near Chesterton.

92
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
I know it well.

93
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Pete Waters's lived around here almost as long as I have.

94
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,600
How long is it going to take for me to get there?

95
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
About fifteen minutes.

96
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
There's a shortcut - if you know it.

97
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
No, I don't.

98
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Could you tell me how to use the shortcut?

99
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Sure. You take the next left turn.

100
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
You'll see a stop sign.

101
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Make a right at the stop sign.

102
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Stay on that road, and you'll cross a blue bridge.

103
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Then you'll see a big old red barn.

104
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
That's the back of Pete Waters's place.

105
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,600
That's quite a difference from the directions that Pete sent me.

106
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Now, if you take that route, it's probably a lot simpler,

107
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
but it'll take you ten minutes longer.

108
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,600
OK. Let me repeat it.

109
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,600
I take the next left turn to the stop sign.

110
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Then a right across a blue bridge,

111
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,600
and then a big red barn.

112
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Can't miss it.

113
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,600
How much do I owe you?

114
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Well, that'll be eighteen dollars and seventy cents.

115
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,600
No charge for the cleanup.

116
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
It's on the house.

117
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Well, here's a twenty.

118
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Ah. OK. That's a dollar and thirty cents change.

119
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,600
There we go... will make twenty. Thanks.

120
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Thank you.

121
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
And thanks for the directions.

122
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
This must be Pete's barn.

123
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Turn right to the house.

124
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Hi.

125
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Hi. What can I do for you?

126
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Is this the Pete Waters farm?

127
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
It is.

128
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I'm a friend of Pete's.

129
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
I'm looking for the house.

130
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
It's just over yonder.

131
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Keep along this road

132
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
till you get to the end of the fence.

133
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
You'll see the chicken house.

134
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
His house is on the left.

135
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Well, thanks.

136
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,600
"Have gone to the railroad station.

137
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Back soon with a surprise.

138
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Make yourself at home.

139
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Have a look around. Pete."

140
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Same old Pete Waters.

141
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Always full of surprises.

142
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Don't tell me.

143
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Please don't tell me.

144
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
I recognize you...

145
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Oh, don't be silly, Arnie.

146
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Of course you recognize him.

147
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Except for the beard, he hasn't changed in fifty years.

148
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
It's Malcolm Stewart!

149
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
I know it's Malcolm Stewart.

150
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
You haven't changed much in fifty years.

151
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Peggy... Peggy Pendleton!

152
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
You're Peggy Pendleton!

153
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Who am I, you old rascal?

154
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
You don't recognize me, do you?

155
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
I know who you are.

156
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
You're Arnold Franklin!

157
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
I know who you are!

158
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,600
You look wonderful, Malcolm!

159
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Sit down. Sit down.

160
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Pete isn't home. Pete

161
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Really?

162
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,600
No. He left a note on the door

163
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,600
saying he was going to the railroad station

164
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
to pick up a surprise.

165
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
He's so funny.

166
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Always full of surprises,

167
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
even fifty years later.

168
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,600
The two of you look unbelievable!

169
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
How's your family?

170
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Oh, I was sorry

171
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
to hear about your wife having passed away.

172
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Yes. About four years ago.

173
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
And you're living with your children now? In New York?

174
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Pete wrote us and told us.

175
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Yup.

176
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Retired and moved to New York

177
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
to live with my son and his family.

178
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
By the way,

179
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
what do you think this big surprise is?

180
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,600
It could be most anything, knowing Pete.

181
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Hey, that must be Pete!

182
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Now we'll find out about the surprise.

183
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,600
So good to see you all!

184
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Oh, Pete, Pete!

185
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Oh, it's so good to see you!

186
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Remember Lillian?

187
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
I remember all of you.

188
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
You haven't changed a bit.

189
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Lillian! Oh, my gosh!

190
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Lillian Winters.

191
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
We were together in the Thursday night drama society.

192
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Remember me, Malcolm?

193
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Oh, beautiful as ever, Lillian.

194
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
How's Donald?

195
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
That's OK, Malcolm.

196
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Donald passed away a couple of years ago.

197
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Sorry to hear that, Lillian.

198
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Oh, I'm so sorry.

199
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
I would not have missed this get-together for the world!

200
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
And your little surprise, Pete?

201
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
You really surprised me

202
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
by having us all come together.

203
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,600
You don't know what the surprise is yet?

204
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Come on!

205
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,600
We'll tell you the big surprise.

206
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:08,600
I've invited you here for the weekend to help celebrate.

207
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Celebrate?

208
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Our fiftieth reunion?

209
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
No.

210
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
No. Pete wants to tell you ...

211
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Now, let me have the honor, Lillian.

212
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
For goodness' sake, Pete, tell us!

213
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
I can't wait much longer.

214
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Well, I am pouring this iced tea

215
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,600
so that we can toast Lillian and me.

216
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,600
You don't mean to tell me that you and...

217
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Yes, I do.

218
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,600
I have loved Lillian all these years,

219
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,600
so I asked her to be Mrs. Pete Waters.

220
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
And I said yes.

221
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,600
I knew it! I knew it!

222
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Congratulations!

223
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Oh, Lillian,

224
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
I am so happy for you both.

225
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
It's wonderful!

226
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
It's wonderful for me.

227
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Lillian will make me a happy man, finally.

228
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
You are full of surprises, Pete.

229
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
We are going to

230
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,600
spend the entire weekend having a good time together here

231
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
on the farm.

232
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,600
We are going to celebrate all weekend.

233
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
When is the wedding?

234
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,600
That's another surprise.

235
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Lillian and I were married two weeks ago in Detroit.

236
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,600
She's come here to stay.

237
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Wait till I tell my family about this!

238
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Why, that's wonderful!
