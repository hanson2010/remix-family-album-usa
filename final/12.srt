Episode 12 - You're Tops

3
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,020
Is that you, Susan?

4
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,100
It's me, Grandpa.

5
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,460
Am I glad to see you!

6
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,140
And am I glad to see you!

7
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,720
I am also glad to be here.

8
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,240
How are things?

9
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,000
I have been talking to a group of salesmen

10
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,860
since ten this morning,

11
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,520
and I'm real exhausted.

12
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,320
Well, you look good.

13
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,720
What's Harry doing tonight?

14
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,540
He and Michelle

15
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,340
are visiting relatives in New Jersey today.

16
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,500
The rest of our family went to the movies.

17
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,660
So it's just you and me, Susan.

18
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,660
It's nice to be alone with you, Grandpa.

19
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,700
We don't get to see enough of each other.

20
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,720
Oh, I feel the same way, Susan.

21
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,420
I miss seeing you.

22
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,120
But to tell the truth,

23
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,660
next time

24
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,820
I'd like to go into the city and meet you there,

25
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,600
instead of you coming here.

26
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,800
You don't need to do that, Grandpa.

27
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,520
Yeah, I do.

28
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,660
I need to get out more.

29
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,920
Well, I mean

30
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,220
there's a lot to do around the house,

31
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,240
and I love being here with the family,

32
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,620
you know,

33
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,360
but I'm restless.

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,560
Since I retired,

35
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,200
I've got extra time on my hands.

36
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,660
I understand, Grandpa.

37
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,500
I think you do.

38
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,460
Frankly,

39
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,700
I'd like to use my brain a little more.

40
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,460
Grandpa,

41
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,080
you have so much energy and so many years of experience.

42
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,520
There are probably a lot of places for you to work.

43
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,020
Particularly in the construction field.

44
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,740
But at my age,

45
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,140
I'm not looking for a full-time job.

46
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,740
I'm retired.

47
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,960
But I'm bored.

48
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,980
Well, there must be something.

49
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,980
Maybe I can help.

50
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,360
Let's go into the kitchen,

51
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,040
and maybe you can help me set the table.

52
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,580
Sounds good to me.

53
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,600
What are we having?

54
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,240
I prepared lamb chops,

55
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,000
mashed potatoes, and a tossed green salad to begin with.

56
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,440
Grandpa, you are a terrific guy!

57
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,060
You're still thinking about something to do, aren't you?

58
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,540
A job of some kind.

59
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,640
That's right.

60
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,220
I've been thinking about it for weeks now.

61
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,260
There must be some way to put my mind to good use.

62
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,300
We'll find a solution.

63
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,160
A positive solution

64
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,540
to your finding a way to use that wonderful mind of yours.

65
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,320
Sam, would you come in, please?

66
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,300
You sound like something's bothering you, Susan.

67
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
The sketches for the cover of the new doll book?

68
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
That's not it.

69
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,260
Please sit down.

70
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:33,920
Sure.

71
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,420
I need your advice on a personsal matter,

72
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,960
but it's not about me.

73
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,700
You need my advice on a personal matter,

74
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,600
and it's not about you. OK.

75
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,120
It's about my grandfather.

76
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,580
What's the problem?

77
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,360
It won't sound like a big deal,

78
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,160
but it is.

79
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,600
I had dinner with him Saturday,

80
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,200
and he's very unhappy about not working.

81
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,220
I thought he was retired

82
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,300
and pleased to be living with the family.

83
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
He is,

84
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,120
but there's so much energy and talent in the man,

85
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,600
and he doesn't get to use it.

86
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,100
But what can I do?

87
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,400
What kind of advice are you looking for?

88
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,240
Simply this.

89
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,480
John Marchetta runs this company.

90
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,040
He founded this company.

91
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,760
Right.

92
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,500
John Marchetta gave me my start here six years ago,

93
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,600
When I first graduated from college.

94
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,660
He gave me the chance to use my talents

95
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,300
and made me feel more confident.

96
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,960
Right.

97
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,660
Maybe he can do the same thing for your grandfather.

98
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,060
Or at least give him some advice.

99
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,320
Right.

100
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,760
Then I've solved your problem.

101
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,920
I can always depend on you, Sam.

102
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,480
I'm glad to help.

103
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,940
Shall I call Mr. Marchetta for you?

104
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,880
No, no. I'll do that.

105
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,640
Thanks.

106
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,460
Now, how's the Stewart family?

107
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,420
Fine, thank you, Mr. Mrarchetta.

108
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,680
Except for my grandfather.

109
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,120
What's wrong, Susan?

110
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,060
What's wrong with him?

111
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,860
He needs to work.

112
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:23,260
In fact, that is the reason why I'm here to see you.

113
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,740
I know you're building a new factory,

114
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,880
and I thought... maybe...

115
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,940
my grandfather is

116
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,380
so experienced in the construction trade,

117
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,420
he could be so valuable.

118
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,600
Tell him to come and see me

119
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,120
at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

120
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,960
I have an idea that may solve the problem for him

121
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,640
and help a lot of other people.

122
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,260
Really, Mr. Marchetta?

123
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,280
Can I tell him that?

124
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,220
Sure can.

125
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,080
Ten o'clock in the morning. Here.

126
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,360
Oh, thank you!

127
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,840
Hi. I'm Malcolm Stewart.

128
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,200
John Marchetta.

129
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,820
Sit down, sit down.

130
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,520
Susan has told me a great deal about you.

131
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,360
She says you're quite a man.

132
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,240
She says

133
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,220
a lot of wonderful things about you too, Mr. Stewart.

134
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,840
That's always nice to hear, Mr. Marchetta.

135
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,900
Call me John.

136
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,920
May I call you Malcolm?

137
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,020
Let's talk business.

138
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,480
That's music to my ears.

139
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,380
I understand

140
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,260
you used to be in the construction business.

141
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,880
Yup. 43 years.

142
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,420
Here's a brief description

143
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,780
of 43 years of on-the-job training.

144
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,500
That is some history!

145
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,360
You're a valuable asset, Malcolm.

146
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,820
Very valuable.

147
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,400
Thank you.

148
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,720
Yup. 43 years.

149
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,640
Half that time in my own construction company.

150
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,640
Big jobs - factories, shopping malls.

151
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,820
That kind of thing.

152
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,420
Then you retired.

153
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,560
Yes.

154
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,160
After my wife died,

155
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,440
and I felt I should spend more time

156
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,740
with my children and grandchildren.

157
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,020
I lived in Florida,

158
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,580
and they lived in New York.

159
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,300
I understand.

160
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,640
My dautghter Cami lives in New York.

161
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,920
I like being near her.

162
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,820
When I came here,

163
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,160
I planned to take a few months off.

164
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,860
Relax with the family and then look for some work.

165
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,260
Put my experience on the line...

166
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,440
but, unfortunately,

167
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,820
there isn't any work for a retired person my age.

168
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,460
Sometimes there is,

169
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
and sometimes there isn't.

170
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,620
Well, I'm involved with an organization,

171
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,860
and we're trying to resolve that problem.

172
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,120
What's that?

173
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,340
TOPS. T-O-P-S

174
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,660
means Talented Older People's Society.

175
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,240
I'd like to be a member.

176
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,940
How much are the dues?

177
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,620
There are no dues.

178
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,200
The organization serves major companies in this city.

179
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,120
Why?

180
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,080
Because our members are men and women like you.

181
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,800
Experienced, talented, retired.

182
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,320
But our members want to go out there

183
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,500
and use their talents.

184
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,400
They want to work.

185
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,160
That is fantastic, John!

186
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,800
I've got an idea for you, Malcolm.

187
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,660
Just fill out this form for me.

188
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,080
It'll only take a few minutes.

189
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,000
Sit right here,

190
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,760
and do it while I talk to my secretary.

191
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,560
When I get back, we'll talk about my new factory.

192
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,360
My company is a member of TOPS.

193
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,200
So I try hard to find opportunities for people like you. Malcolm.

194
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,020
And when I see an opportunity,

195
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,120
I can act on it.

196
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,160
Well, I can use your brainpower on the job right now.

197
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,500
Have you got time this morning

198
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,880
to go over to the construction site with me?

199
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,720
I'd like to have you meet my foreman,

200
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,400
get some background on the job.

201
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,740
I've got plenty of time.

202
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,060
I'll be right back.

203
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,620
We'll go over to the job site together.

204
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,840
Malcolm, you worked on the Spaceport project?

205
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,420
My company was the contractor.

206
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,840
I built the theater there

207
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:03,860
with my own two hands, practically.

209
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,980
I understand.

210
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,540
Well,

211
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,400
I'm glad to see you two guys getting along so well

212
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,580
because, Danny,

213
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,380
Malcolm is on the TOPS team.

214
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,400
He's going to be working with you for a while.

215
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,200
His experience will be valuable to both of us.

216
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,020
Welcome aboard, Malcolm!

217
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,680
I'm going back to my office.

218
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,400
Give me a call later, Malcolm.

219
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,140
I'll tell you the time and date of the next TOPS meeting.

220
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,620
I'd like you to meet the group.

221
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,700
I will, John.

222
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,420
And again, thanks.

223
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,400
No. thank you.

224
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,140
And thank Susan.

225
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,320
He's quite a man.

226
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,820
A real inspiration for me.

227
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,740
OK, Danny.

228
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,020
I know you didn't expect to have me around,

229
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,740
but I think I can be of some help to you.

230
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,160
Let me tell you something, Malcolm.

231
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,640
With your background and experience,

232
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,740
I can learn something

233
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,980
and I do need some advice on a difficult problem.

234
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,600
Let me show you this.

235
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,420
I don't want to give you a final opinion

236
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,960
without studying these building plans more carefully.

237
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,320
But a simple solution might be

238
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,680
to move the air-conditioning units

239
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,320
instead of redesigning the entire system.

240
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,100
It might be simpler and less expensive.

241
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,420
You just earned your weight in gold, Malcolm.

242
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,860
Welcome aboard!

243
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,220
It all happened so quickly!

244
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,800
I can't believe it!

245
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,220
I'm glad Mr. Marchetta was so helpful.

246
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,840
He was more than helpful.

247
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,940
He actually took me to meet his foreman.

248
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,440
I'm thrilled for you, Grandpa.

249
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,660
I don't know how to thank you, Susan.

250
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,880
You're a wonderful granddaughter.

251
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,260
It's good to see you so happy.

252
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,500
I'll be at the construction site tomorrow.

253
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,360
What are you doing tomorrow night?

254
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,540
I'm not doing anything.

255
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,160
Why?

256
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,560
How about a date with your grandfather?

257
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,420
I owe you a good steak dinner.

258
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,260
I'll accept.

259
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,420
Tomorrow night.

260
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,040
You and me. Dinner.

261
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,120
What time?

262
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,640
I'll pick you up here at seven.

263
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,620
Is that OK?

264
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,980
I can't wait!

265
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,000
And you can tell me

266
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,060
all about your first full day back on the job.

267
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,760
It's a deal!
