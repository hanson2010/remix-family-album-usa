Episode 12 - You're Tops

3
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Is that you, Susan?

4
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,600
It's me, Grandpa.

5
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Am I glad to see you!

6
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
And am I glad to see you!

7
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
I am also glad to be here.

8
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
How are things?

9
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I have been talking to a group of salesmen

10
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
since ten this morning,

11
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
and I'm real exhausted.

12
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Well, you look good.

13
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
What's Harry doing tonight?

14
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
He and Michelle

15
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
are visiting relatives in New Jersey today.

16
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
The rest of our family went to the movies.

17
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,600
So it's just you and me, Susan.

18
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
It's nice to be alone with you, Grandpa.

19
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
We don't get to see enough of each other.

20
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Oh, I feel the same way, Susan.

21
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
I miss seeing you.

22
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
But to tell the truth,

23
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
next time

24
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
I'd like to go into the city and meet you there,

25
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
instead of you coming here.

26
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
You don't need to do that, Grandpa.

27
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Yeah, I do.

28
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
I need to get out more.

29
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Well, I mean

30
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,600
there's a lot to do around the house,

31
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
and I love being here with the family,

32
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
you know,

33
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
but I'm restless.

34
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Since I retired,

35
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
I've got extra time on my hands.

36
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
I understand, Grandpa.

37
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
I think you do.

38
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Frankly,

39
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
I'd like to use my brain a little more.

40
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Grandpa,

41
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,600
you have so much energy and so many years of experience.

42
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,600
There are probably a lot of places for you to work

43
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Particularly in the construction field.

44
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
But at my age,

45
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
I'm not looking for a full-time job.

46
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
I'm retired.

47
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
But I'm bored.

48
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Well, there must be something.

49
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Maybe I can help.

50
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Let's go into the kitchen,

51
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,600
and maybe you can help me set the table.

52
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Sounds good to me.

53
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
What are we having?

54
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
I prepared lamb chops,

55
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,600
mashed potatoes, and a tossed green salad to begin with.

56
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Grandpa, you are a terrific guy!

57
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:05,600
You're still thinking about something to do, aren't you?

58
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
A job of some kind.

59
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
That's right.

60
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,600
I've been thinking about it for weeks now.

61
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
There must be some way to put my mind to good use.

62
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,600
We'll find a solution.

63
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
A positive solution

64
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,600
to your finding a way to use that wonderful mind of yours.

65
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Sam, would you come in, please?

66
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,600
You sound like something's bothering you, Susan.

67
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,600
The sketches for the cover of the new doll book?

68
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
That's not it.

69
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Please sit down.

70
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Sure.

71
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:42,600
I need your advice on a personsal matter,

72
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
but it's not about me.

73
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,600
You need my advice on a personal matter,

74
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
and it's not about you.

75
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,600
It's about my grandfather.

76
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
What's the problem?

77
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,600
It won't sound like a big deal,

78
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
but it is.

79
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I had dinner with him Saturday,

80
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
and he's very unhappy about not working.

81
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,600
I thought he was retired

82
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
and pleased to be living with the family.

83
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
He is,

84
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,600
but there's so much energy and talent in the man,

85
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
and he doesn't get to use it.

86
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
But what can I do?

87
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
What kind of advice are you looking for?

88
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Simply this.

89
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,600
John Marchetta runs this company.

90
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
He founded this company.

91
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Right.

92
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,600
John Marchetta gave me my start here six years ago,

93
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,600
When I first graduated from college.

94
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,600
He gave me the chance to use my talents

95
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
and made me feel more confident.

96
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Right.

97
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Maybe he can do the same thing for your grandfather.

98
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Or at least give him some advice.

99
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Right.

100
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Then I've solved your problem.

101
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I can always depend on you, Sam.

102
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm glad to help.

103
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Shall I call Mr. Marchetta for you?

104
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,600
No, no. I'll do that.

105
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Thanks.

106
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Now, how's the Stewart family?

107
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Fine, thank you, Mr. Mrarchetta.

108
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Except for my grandfather.

109
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
What's wrong, Susan?

110
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
What's wrong with him?

111
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
He needs to work.

112
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,600
In fact, that is the reason why I'm here to see you.

113
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,600
I know you're building a new factory,

114
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,600
and I thought ... maybe ...

115
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
my grandfather is

116
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
so experienced in the construction trade,

117
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,600
he could be so valuable.

118
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Tell him to come and see me

119
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,600
at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

120
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
I have an idea that may solve the problem for him

121
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
and help a lot of other people.

122
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Really, Mr. Marchetta?

123
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Can I tell him that?

124
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Sure can.

125
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Ten o'clock in the morning. Here.

126
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Oh, thank you!

127
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Hi. I'm Malcolm Stewart.

128
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
John Marchetta.

129
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Sit down, sit down.

130
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Susan has told me a great deal about you.

131
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
She says you're quite a man.

132
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
She says

133
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,600
a lot of wonderful things about you too, Mr. Stewart.

134
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,600
That's always nice to hear, Mr. Marchetta.

135
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Call me John.

136
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
May I call you Malcolm?

137
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Let's talk business.

138
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
That's music to my ears.

139
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
I understand

140
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
you used to be in the construction business.

141
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Yup. Forty-three years.

142
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Here's a brief description

143
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,600
of forty-three years of on-the-job training.

144
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,600
That is some history!

145
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,600
You're a valuable asset, Malcolm.

146
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Very valuable.

147
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Thank you.

148
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,600
Yup. Forty-three years.

149
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Half that time in my own construction company.

150
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Big jobs - factories, shopping malls.

151
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
That kind of thing.

152
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Then you retired.

153
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
Yes.

154
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
After my wife died,

155
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,600
and I felt I should spend more time

156
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
with my children and grandchildren.

157
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
I lived in Florida,

158
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
and they lived in New York.

159
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
I understand.

160
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
My dautghter Cami lives in New York.

161
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
I like being near her.

162
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,600
When I came here,

163
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
I planned to take a few months off.

164
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Relax with the family and then look for some work.

165
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Put my experience on the line...

166
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,600
but, unfortunately,

167
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,600
there isn't any work for a retired person my age.

168
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Sometimes there is,

169
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
and sometimes there isn't.

170
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Well, I'm involved with an organization,

171
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
and we're trying to resolve that problem.

172
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
What's that?

173
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,600
TOPS. TOPS.

174
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,600
T-O-P-S means Talented Older People's Society.

175
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
I'd like to be a member.

176
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
How much are the dues?

177
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
There are no dues.

178
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,600
The organization serves major companies in this city.

179
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Why?

180
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Because our members are men and women like you.

181
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Experienced, talented, retired.

182
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,600
But our members want to go out there

183
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
and use their talents.

184
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
They want to work.

185
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,600
That is fantastic, John!

186
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I've got an idea for you, Malcolm.

187
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Just fill out this form for me.

188
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,600
It'll only take a few minutes.

189
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Sit right here,

190
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
and do it while I talk to my secretary.

191
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,600
When I get back, we'll talk about my new factory.

192
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,600
My company is a member of TOPS.

193
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,600
So I try hard to find opportunities for people like you.

194
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Malcolm. Malcolm

195
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
And when I see an opportunity,

196
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
I can act on it.

197
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Well, I can use your brainpower on the job right now.

198
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Have you got time this morning

199
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,600
to go over to the construction site with me?

200
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
I'd like to have you meet my foreman,

201
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
get some background on the job.

202
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
I've got plenty of time.

203
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
I'll be right back.

204
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
We'll go over to the job site together.

205
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Malcolm, you worked on the Spaceport project?

206
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
My company was the contractor.

207
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
I built the theater there

208
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
with my own two hands, practically.

209
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
I understand.

210
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Well,

211
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
I'm glad to see you two guys getting along so well

212
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
because, Danny,

213
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Malcolm is on the TOPS team.

214
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
He's going to be working with you for a while.

215
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,600
His experience will be valuable to both of us.

216
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Welcome aboard, Malcolm!

217
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
I'm going back to my office.

218
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Give me a call later, Malcolm.

219
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
I'll tell you the time and date of the next TOPS meeting.

220
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
I'd like you to meet the group.

221
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
I will, John.

222
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
And again, thanks.

223
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
No. thank you.

224
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
And thank Susan.

225
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,600
He's quite a man.

226
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
A real inspiration for me.

227
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,600
OK, Danny.

228
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
I know you didn't expect to have me around,

229
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,600
but I think I can be of some help to you.

230
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Let me tell you something, Malcolm.

231
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
With your background and experience,

232
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
I can learn something

233
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
and I do need some advice on a difficult problem.

234
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Let me show you this.

235
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:04,600
I don't want to give you a final opinion

236
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,600
without studying these building plans more carefully.

237
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,600
But a simple solution might be

238
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,600
to move the air-conditioning units

239
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,600
instead of redesigning the entire system.

240
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,600
It might be simpler and less expensive .

241
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,600
You just earned your weight in gold, Malcolm.

242
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,600
Welcome aboard!

243
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,600
It all happened so quickly!

244
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
I can't believe it!

245
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
I'm glad Mr. Marchetta was so helpful.

246
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
He was more than helpful.

247
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
He actually took me to meet his foreman.

248
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
I'm thrilled for you, Grandpa.

249
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,600
I don't know how to thank you, Susan.

250
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
You're a wonderful granddaughter.

251
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
It's good to see you so happy.

252
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
I'll be at the construction site tomorrow.

253
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,600
What are you doing tomorrow night?

254
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
I'm not doing anything.

255
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Why?

256
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
How about a date with your grandfather?

257
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
I owe you a good steak dinner.

258
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
I'll accept.

259
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
Tomorrow night.

260
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
You and me. Dinner.

261
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
What time?

262
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
I'll pick you up here at seven .

263
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Is that OK?

264
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
I can't wait!

265
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
And you can tell me

266
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,600
all about your first full day back on the job.

267
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
It's a deal!
