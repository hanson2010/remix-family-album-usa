1
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,600
I don't believe it!

2
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
What's wrong?

3
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Carter Boswell!

4
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Who's Carter Boswell?

5
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
He's running for the school board.

6
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
The election's next month.

7
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
What's wrong with wanting to be on the school board?

8
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Nothing.

9
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
But he wants to cut the school budget!

10
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Maybe it needs cutting.

11
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Cutting the budget is fine,

12
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
but he wants to do it

13
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
by cutting all the cultural programs.

14
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
No music, no dance,

15
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
no concert, no stage presentations.

16
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Why does he want to do that?

17
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,600
He says it's to save the taxpayers' money,

18
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
and I think he believes

19
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
that the taxpayers will vote for him

20
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
if he spends less on the cultural programs.

21
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
He's probably right.

22
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Lots of people want their taxes

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
used for new books

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
and a new paint job in the schoolrooms.

25
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Maybe some of us would like to pay a little bit more

26
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
and keep the cultural programs for our kids.

27
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Well, I'm not sure. Ellen.

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,600
I hear it from my patients.

29
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Lots of people are tired of higher taxes.

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
I know,

31
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
but if Boswell wins

32
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
he'll be an important decision-maker

33
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
on the school board,

34
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
and he doesn't know anything

35
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
about our children's education.

36
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Who's running against him?

37
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Nobody. That's the problem.

38
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Well, it sounds to me like Carter Boswell

39
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
is going to win this seat on the board.

40
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Oh, not if I can stop him!

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
And how are you going to stop him?

42
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
I don't know.

43
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Maybe I'll run against him.

44
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Well, you've got my vote.

45
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,600
I'm serious, Philip.

46
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Why shouldn't I run?

47
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Why shouldn't you run for what, Mom?

48
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Your mother is thinking of

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
running for the school board.

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Hey, that's terrific, Mom!

51
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Against Carter Boswell?

52
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Great!

53
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Well, if I run for office,

54
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
the voters will have a clear choice.

55
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,600
I stand for everything Boswell doesn't.

56
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
I think a lot of people will vote for you

57
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
against Boswell, Ellen.

58
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
I'll vote for you.

59
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Will you help me if I do run?

60
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Absolutely.

61
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
The trouble is

62
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
it takes a little bit of money to run a campaign.

63
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,600
I think you can make a difference, Ellen.

64
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
And in a short campaign

65
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
you wouldn't need as much money.

66
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
You know something, Ellen?

67
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Why not give the people of Riverdale a clear choice?

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
I'm with you.

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
You can make a difference.

70
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Come in.

71
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Mr. Maxwell?

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Yes, Charles Maxwell.

73
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
My name is Ellen Stewart.

74
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Hello.

75
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Please, sit down.

76
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,600
You asked to see me.

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
What would you like to see me about?

78
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,600
I'd like your help.

79
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Well,

80
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,600
I'm editor of the most influential newspaper in Riverdale.

81
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Actually, it's the only newspaper.

82
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
A lot of people would like my help.

83
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Do you have a story?

84
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
I'm planning to run for the school board.

85
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Against Carter Boswell?

86
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Yes.

87
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Well, that is news.

88
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Will you announce that I'm running?

89
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Sure.

90
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
But I need some information.

91
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Of course.

92
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Why will the voters vote for you against Boswell,

93
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Mrs. Stewart? Stewart

94
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Because I care.

95
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,600
"Vote for Ellen Stewart. She cares."

96
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Not a bad slogan.

97
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,600
But what do you care about?

98
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Well, I care about the children of our town.

99
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
I don't want them to grow up

100
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
without cultural programs in our school.

101
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Do you have a plan?

102
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,600
I want our children to learn

103
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
more than reading, writing, and arithmetic.

104
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,600
I want to keep the after-school programs -

105
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
the music, the concerts.

106
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,600
It's not a bad plan.

107
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
But who's going to pay for all of this?

108
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
We are.

109
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,600
The citizens of Riverdale, of course.

110
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
I plan to get help

111
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
from the businessmen and the corporations of Riverdale.

112
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
That's fair enough.

113
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Exactly what do you want from me, Mrs. Stewart?

114
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,600
You don't know me.

115
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,600
I can't expect you to take my side against Boswell.

116
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
But I do need some publicity

117
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
so that the people of our town

118
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
know that I'm running for office

119
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
and that I care about our children.

120
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Fair enough.

121
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,600
I certainly can print the news.

122
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
And you are now making news.
