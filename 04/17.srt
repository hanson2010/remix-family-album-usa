1
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,600
I love parades.

2
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,600
The Thanksgiving Day parade is always such great fun.

3
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Look at that Superman balloon!

4
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Wowee! Just floating along high above Central Park West.

5
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Don't you just love it?

6
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Oh, and the bands and the music.

7
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
John Philip Sousa.

8
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
I love his music.

9
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Da dada da da dada da da da da da da dada.

10
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Oh, look at that float, Robbie.

11
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Look at those funny-looking clowns.

12
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
It's for kids.

13
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Maybe so, but parades always make me feel like a kid.

14
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Remember when you and your dad and I

15
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
went to the Thanksgiving Day parade?

16
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,600
You were four or five years old, I think.

17
00:10:50,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Hello, hello... Oh, hi, Susan.

18
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,600
How are you? Here's Mom.

19
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Hello, Susan.

20
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Yes, he missed a phone call from Alexandra.

21
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Yes, I know, but he'll get over it.

22
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Good. Then you'll be here about five?

23
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Oh, fine.

24
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,600
I look forward to seeing you and Harry and Michelle.

25
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Drive carefully.

26
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Good-bye.

27
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Taste Ellen's turkey dressing.

28
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
It's delicious.

29
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
I'm not surprised.

30
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
It's Grandma's recipe.

31
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
It's my favorite part of the meal.

32
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
What about my famous apple pie?

33
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Dad, your apple pie is my favorite dessert.

34
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
How's the parade?

35
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
OK.

36
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Mom! Is it for me?

37
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
No, Robbie.

38
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Who was it?

39
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Wrong number.

40
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Philip, would you join me in the kitchen, please?

41
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
It's getting late.

42
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
We have vegetables to prepare.

43
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Can I help with anything?

44
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
No, honey.

45
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
You just relax with Grandpa.

46
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
I'll get you to help serve later.

47
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Ellen reminds me so much of Grandma.

48
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
What time does the Michigan football game come on?

49
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Four.

50
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Philip!

51
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
I'll be back to see the game.

52
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Grandpa, when did Dad graduate from Michigan?

53
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Let me think.

54
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,600
He graduated from medical school in 1960

55
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
and from the University of Michigan in 1956.

56
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Did you go to Michigan, too, Grandpa?

57
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Yup. I graduated in 1937.

58
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:52,600
I've got to start thinking about college soon.
