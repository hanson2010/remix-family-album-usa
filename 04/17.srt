1
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,100
I love parades.

2
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,100
The Thanksgiving Day parade is always such great fun.

3
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,100
Look at that Superman balloon!

4
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:52,100
Wowee! Just floating along high above Central Park West.

5
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,100
Don't you just love it?

6
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,100
Oh, and the bands and the music.

7
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
John Philip Sousa. John Philip Soussa

8
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
I love his music.

9
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:07,100
Da dada da da dada da da da da da da dada.

10
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Oh, look at that float, Robbie.

11
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Look at those funny-looking clowns.

12
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
It's for kids.

13
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Maybe so, but parades always make me feel like a kid.

14
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Remember when you and your dad and I

15
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,100
went to the Thanksgiving Day parade?

16
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,100
You were four or five years old, I think.

17
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:39,100
Hello, hello.... Oh, hi, Susan.

18
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,100
How are you?... Here's Mom.

19
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,100
Hello, Susan.

20
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Yes, he missed a phone call from Alexandra.

21
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Yes, I know, but he'll get over it.

22
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,100
Good. Then you'll be here about five?

23
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Oh, fine.

24
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,100
I look forward to seeing you and Harry and Michelle.

25
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
Drive carefully.

26
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Good-bye.

27
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,100
Taste Ellen's turkey dressing.

28
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,100
It's delicious.

29
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
I'm not surprised.

30
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,100
It's Grandma's recipe.

31
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
It's my favorite part of the meal.

32
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,100
What about my famous apple pie?

33
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Dad, your apple pie is my favorite dessert.

34
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,100
How's the parade?

35
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
OK.

36
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Mom! Is it for me?

37
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,100
No, Robbie.

38
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Who was it?

39
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Wrong number.

40
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Philip, would you join me in the kitchen, please? Philip

41
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
It's getting late.

42
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,100
We have vegetables to prepare.

43
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,100
Can I help with anything?

44
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
No, honey.

45
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
You just relax with Grandpa.

46
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
I'll get you to help serve later.

47
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Ellen reminds me so much of Grandma. Ellen

48
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
What time does the Michigan football game come on? Michigan

49
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,100
Four.

50
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,100
Philip! Philip

51
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,100
I'll be back to see the game.

52
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Grandpa, when did Dad graduate from Michigan?

53
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
Let me think.

54
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,100
He graduated from medical school in 1960

55
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,100
and from the University of Michigan in 1956.

56
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Did you go to Michigan, too, Grandpa?

57
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,100
Yup. I graduated in 1937.

58
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:31,100
I've got to start thinking about college soon.
