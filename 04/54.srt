1
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,600
My slogan is "I care".

2
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,600
I care about people, not things.

3
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Vote for me, Ellen Stewart.

4
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
I care.

5
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,600
How was it?

6
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
You were terrific!

7
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Can I see it?

8
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Sure.

9
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Hello. My name is Ellen Stewart,

10
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,600
and I'm running for the open seat on the school board.

11
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,600
My slogan is "I care".

12
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,600
What does the word care mean?

13
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,600
I care about people, not things.

14
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Vote for me, Ellen Stewart.

15
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I care.

16
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,600
I like it,

17
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
but now what?

18
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,600
How can we possibly get it on so Riverdale

19
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
will see it and hear it?

20
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Leave it to me.

21
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,600
I mean that when I say "I care",

22
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,600
I care about people, not things.

23
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Vote for me, Ellen Stewart.

24
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
I care.

25
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
What happened?

26
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Mom is now on television

27
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
in every appliance store in Riverdale,

28
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
except Hamlin's.

29
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
He's a Boswell voter.

30
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
That's a brilliant idea, Richard!

31
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
You inherited your father's brains.

32
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,600
We got our brains from you, Dad.

33
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
And guess what?

34
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
I called channel five.

35
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
I called channel five.

36
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Their TV news is going to cover it.

37
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,600
"Housewife campaigns in appliance stores."

38
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
And I'll bet

39
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
some magazine will pick up the story, too.

40
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Mom, you're going to win!

41
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
I know it!

42
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Hold it, Robbie!

43
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Just cool down.

44
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
I know we're getting some attention now,

45
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
but in the end the voters will have to decide.

46
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,600
You're gonna win.

47
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Trust me!

48
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,600
In the hotly contested race

49
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,600
for the one seat on the Riverdale School Board,

50
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Mrs. Ellen Stewart has taken an early lead.

51
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
She's winning!

52
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Mom, you're winning!

53
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Now returning to other local news...

54
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
Riverdale High School Riverdale

55
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
beat its rival Horace Mann in baseball today It's too soon to know for certain.

56
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
It's too soon to know for certain.

57
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
You're ahead.

58
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
That's better than being behind.

59
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
More sports after this.

60
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
It's not over yet.

61
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Let's just all calm down,

62
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
and wait for the final results.

63
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Ellen, why don't you go out to the backyard

64
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
and get some fresh air?

65
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Thank you, Grandpa.

66
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
I need some.

67
00:17:46,600 --> 00:18:08,600
What happened?

68
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:15,600
You came very close, Ellen.

69
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,600
You lost by only a hundred and twenty-one votes.

70
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:28,600
I lost.

71
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
You tried, Mom.

72
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,600
You lost by a very small number of votes.

73
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Only one hundred and twenty-one votes!

74
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
I'm sorry, Mom.

75
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,600
There just wasn't enough time.

76
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Look,

77
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
you've made a very strong impression

78
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
on our community.

79
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,600
You'll have another chance next election.

80
00:18:50,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Hello.

81
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Oh, yes, yes, Mr. Maxwell.

82
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Hello, Mr. Maxwell.

83
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
How are you?

84
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
I just called to tell you

85
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
that you are very impressive.

86
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
You lost the election,

87
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
but you won the attention of the residents of Riverdale,

88
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
of Boswell, and of me.

89
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Well, thank you, Mr. Maxwell.

90
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
I appreciate your kind words.

91
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
I needed that.

92
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
I hear Boswell

93
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
wants to appoint you to a special arts committee.

94
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I'm sending over a reporter

95
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
in the morning to interview you.

96
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
You are?

97
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,600
I'm gonna do an article

98
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
on "Ellen Stewart, she cares".

99
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Maybe we'll all care now.

100
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Good-bye.

101
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Thank you,

102
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
and good-bye.

103
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:07,600
What was that about?

104
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
You were right, Philip.

105
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,600
I did make a difference in town.

106
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
And in this family.
