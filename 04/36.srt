00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Hi. I'm Malcolm Stewart.

2
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
John Marchetta.

3
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Sit down, sit down.

4
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Susan has told me a great deal about you.

5
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
She says you're quite a man.

6
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
She says

7
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,600
a lot of wonderful things about you too, Mr. Stewart.

8
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,600
That's always nice to hear, Mr. Marchetta.

9
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Call me John.

10
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
May I call you Malcolm?

11
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Let's talk business.

12
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
That's music to my ears.

13
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
I understand

14
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
you used to be in the construction business.

15
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Yup. Forty-three years.

16
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Here's a brief description

17
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,600
of forty-three years of on-the-job training.

18
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,600
That is some history!

19
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,600
You're a valuable asset, Malcolm.

20
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Very valuable.

21
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Thank you.

22
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,600
Yup. Forty-three years.

23
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Half that time in my own construction company.

24
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Big jobs - factories, shopping malls.

25
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
That kind of thing.

26
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Then you retired.

27
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
Yes.

28
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
After my wife died,

29
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,600
and I felt I should spend more time

30
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
with my children and grandchildren.

31
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
I lived in Florida,

32
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
and they lived in New York.

33
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
I understand.

34
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
My dautghter Cami lives in New York.

35
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
I like being near her.

36
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,600
When I came here,

37
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
I planned to take a few months off.

38
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Relax with the family and then look for some work.

39
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Put my experience on the line...

40
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,600
but, unfortunately,

41
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,600
there isn't any work for a retired person my age.

42
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Sometimes there is,

43
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
and sometimes there isn't.

44
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Well, I'm involved with an organization,

45
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
and we're trying to resolve that problem.

46
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
What's that?

47
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,600
TOPS. TOPS.

48
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,600
T-O-P-S means Talented Older People's Society.

49
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
I'd like to be a member.

50
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
How much are the dues?

51
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
There are no dues.

52
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,600
The organization serves major companies in this city.

53
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Why?

54
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Because our members are men and women like you.

55
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Experienced, talented, retired.

56
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,600
But our members want to go out there

57
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
and use their talents.

58
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
They want to work.

59
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,600
That is fantastic, John!

60
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I've got an idea for you, Malcolm.

61
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Just fill out this form for me.

62
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,600
It'll only take a few minutes.

63
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Sit right here,

64
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
and do it while I talk to my secretary.

65
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,600
When I get back, we'll talk about my new factory.

66
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,600
My company is a member of TOPS.

67
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,600
So I try hard to find opportunities for people like you.

68
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Malcolm. Malcolm

69
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
And when I see an opportunity,

70
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
I can act on it.

71
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Well, I can use your brainpower on the job right now.

72
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Have you got time this morning

73
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,600
to go over to the construction site with me?

74
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
I'd like to have you meet my foreman,

75
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
get some background on the job.

76
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
I've got plenty of time.

77
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
I'll be right back.

78
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
We'll go over to the job site together.

79
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Malcolm, you worked on the Spaceport project?

80
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
My company was the contractor.

81
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
I built the theater there

82
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
with my own two hands, practically.

83
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
I understand.

84
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Well,

85
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
I'm glad to see you two guys getting along so well

86
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
because, Danny,

87
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Malcolm is on the TOPS team.

88
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
He's going to be working with you for a while.

89
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,600
His experience will be valuable to both of us.

90
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Welcome aboard, Malcolm!

91
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
I'm going back to my office.

92
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Give me a call later, Malcolm.

93
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
I'll tell you the time and date of the next TOPS meeting.

94
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
I'd like you to meet the group.

95
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
I will, John.

96
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
And again, thanks.

97
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
No. thank you.

98
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
And thank Susan.

99
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,600
He's quite a man.

100
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
A real inspiration for me.

101
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,600
OK, Danny.

102
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
I know you didn't expect to have me around,

103
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,600
but I think I can be of some help to you.

104
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Let me tell you something, Malcolm.

105
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
With your background and experience,

106
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
I can learn something

107
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
and I do need some advice on a difficult problem.

108
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Let me show you this.

109
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:04,600
I don't want to give you a final opinion

110
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,600
without studying these building plans more carefully.

111
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,600
But a simple solution might be

112
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,600
to move the air-conditioning units

113
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,600
instead of redesigning the entire system.

114
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,600
It might be simpler and less expensive .

115
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,600
You just earned your weight in gold, Malcolm.

116
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,600
Welcome aboard!

117
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,600
It all happened so quickly!

118
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
I can't believe it!

119
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
I'm glad Mr. Marchetta was so helpful.

120
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
He was more than helpful.

121
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
He actually took me to meet his foreman.

122
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
I'm thrilled for you, Grandpa.

123
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,600
I don't know how to thank you, Susan.

124
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
You're a wonderful granddaughter.

125
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
It's good to see you so happy.

126
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
I'll be at the construction site tomorrow.

127
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,600
What are you doing tomorrow night?

128
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
I'm not doing anything.

129
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Why?

130
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
How about a date with your grandfather?

131
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
I owe you a good steak dinner.

132
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
I'll accept.

133
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
Tomorrow night.

134
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
You and me. Dinner.

135
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
What time?

136
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
I'll pick you up here at seven .

137
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Is that OK?

138
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
I can't wait!

139
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
And you can tell me

140
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,600
all about your first full day back on the job.

141
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
It's a deal!
