1
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Good morning, Susan.

2
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Good morning, Sam.

3
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,600
What's the schedule today?

4
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Ten o'clock,

5
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
telephone FAO Schwarz about the new twin baby dolls.

6
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
OK.

7
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Telephone Mrs. Zaskey at the advertising agency.

8
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
I did that. Go on.

9
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Eleven o'clock, approve the sketches for the toy spaceship.

10
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Where are they?

11
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Right here.

12
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Did you look at them?

13
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Yes, I did.

14
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
What do you think of the spaceship?

15
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
I think the kids'll love it.

16
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Would you show me the drawings, please?

17
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Huh.

18
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Now, what else is on the schedule today?

19
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Well, at one o'clock

20
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
you have a lunch appointment with Mr. Levine,

21
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
the client from the Toytown Stores.

22
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Where?

23
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
At Rossano's.

24
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Hmm. Anything else?

25
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
At four o'clock,

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
you have a meeting with the production staff

27
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
in the conference room.

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Make sure everybody is at that meeting.

29
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Will do.

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,600
At six you're meeting, Mr. Ozawa.

31
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Oh, yes. Are his models here?

32
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
They're in my office.

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
I'd like to see them.

34
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Right.

35
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
What else?

36
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Come on, Sam.

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
You work too hard, Susan.

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,600
When was your last day off?

39
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Hmm. I can't remember.

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
You really ought to take some time off.

41
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
What for?

42
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,600
To enjoy the simple things in life...

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
I know, Sam.

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Maybe soon.

45
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
To smell the flowers.

46
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Oh, wait a minute. What's today's date?

47
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Today is the twelfth. Why?

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,600
It seems to me I scheduled something else.

49
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,600
There's nothing else in the appointment book.

50
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
I'm sure I did.

51
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Oh, well, I'll probably remember it later.

52
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,600
I hope it isn't important.

53
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Hmm. It's probably nothing.

54
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
OK, let's get started.

55
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Would you call Priscilla Smith at FAO Schwarz, please?

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Right.

57
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:29,600
These are the models from the Japanese film maker.

58
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Thank you. Just put them on my desk.

59
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,600
And the new drawings for the toy spaceship.

60
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Wonderful.

61
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:50,600
That was fast.

62
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
We have a new artist.

63
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
She's very talented.

64
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
What time is it, anyway?

65
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
My watch stopped.

66
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
It's eleven thirty.

67
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,600
What time is my lunch date with Bill Levine?

68
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
One o'clock.

69
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Remind me to leave at twelve forty-five.

70
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Did you remember your other appointment for today?

71
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
No,

72
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
but I have a feeling

73
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
it's going to be too late when I do remember.

74
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Yes, Sam?

75
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
I just solved the mystery.

76
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
What did I forget?

77
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,600
You have some guests in the reception room.

78
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
What? Who?

79
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Mr. Harry Bennett and his daughter.

80
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
I remember!

81
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Oh... Harry!

82
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,600
I made a lunch date with him and his daughter weeks ago.

83
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Is he a client?

84
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,600
He's a friend.

85
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Well, he's here with his daughter to have lunch.

86
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
I met her at Thanksgiving,

87
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,600
and I promised to have lunch with both of them today.

88
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Yes, indeed.

89
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600
What are you going to do about your appointment

90
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
with Mr. Levine?

91
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Any suggestions?

92
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Oh!
