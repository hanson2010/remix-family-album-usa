1
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,100
OK.

2
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,100
Do you know how to play charades?

3
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,100
Frank, you've never played charades? Frank

4
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Nope.

5
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Carl, you're sure you've never played? Carl

6
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:20,100
OK, Betty, Tim, and Frank.

7
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
We're going to play charades.

8
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Frank, you can learn as we go. Frank

9
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
And, Carl, you join in at any time.

10
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,100
OK, let me think.

11
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,100
OK, I've got one.

12
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:44,100
All right.

13
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,100
A movie!

14
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
A movie!

15
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
Right.

16
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,100
A movie.

17
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
OK.

18
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,100
Six words.

19
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,100
It has six words.

20
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
That's easy.

21
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
I can play.

22
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,100
Good. OK.

23
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,100
We've got a movie.

24
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
The title ...

25
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Six words.

26
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,100
Right.

27
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
First word ...

28
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,100
Sounds like.

29
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Sounds like ...

30
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,100
You got that part right.

31
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Yes.

32
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Sounds like ...

33
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,100
Sounds like what?

34
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
Sounds like no.

35
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Absolutely right, Frank.

36
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
Sounds like no.

37
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
OK.

38
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
We've got a movie.

39
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Six words.

40
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
The first word sounds like no.

41
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Row. Row. Row

42
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
Go. Go

43
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Nope.

44
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,100
Show. Show

45
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
That's it--show.

46
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
No ... OK ...

47
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:57,100
Snow.

48
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Absolutely right, Betty.

49
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Sounds like no -- snow.

50
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,100
OK, a movie. Six words.

51
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,100
The first word is snow.

52
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
This is fun.

53
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
Oh, OK.

54
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,100
The fifth word.

55
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Right, fifth word.

56
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Seven?

57
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,100
Absolutely right.

58
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Very good.

59
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,100
The fifth word is seven.

60
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100
OK, we've got a movie.

61
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,100
The first word is snow.

62
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,100
Fifth word, seven.

63
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,100
I got it!

64
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
I got it!

65
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,100
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs

66
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:40,100
I got it.

67
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
I got it.

68
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Frank, you got it. Frank

69
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
Betty, you had it, but you didn't say it. Betty

70
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
I knew it.

71
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Carl, now you know charades. Carl

72
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Why don't you join us?

73
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
I don't like charades.

74
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,100
It's for babies.

75
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
Oh, I like it.

76
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,100
Well, they're babies.

77
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,100
You're a sore loser.

78
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Yeah.

79
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
No arguing.

80
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,100
Save your voices.

81
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Between now and tomorrow

82
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
you're all going to have your tonsils out.

83
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
And you won't be able to speak for a while.

84
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,100
So save your voices till then.

85
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,100
Hi, gang. Hi, everybody.

86
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,100
Well, what's going on?

87
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
I sure I am glad to see you, Dr. Stewart.

88
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,100
This is a rough group.

89
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,100
I didn't want to play charades,

90
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,100
so they're angry at me.

91
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,100
Why don't you want to play?

92
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Because I don't want to be here.

93
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,100
I don't want my tonsils out.

94
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
Why not?

95
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Because my birthday is tomorrow.

96
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,100
My mother promised me a birthday party with a clown.

97
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,100
But you can have one when you go home, Carl.

98
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,100
But my birthday is tomorrow.

99
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
I'm sorry, Carl.

100
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,100
Carl, you'll have your party when you go home, Carl

101
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,100
But it won't be on my birthday!

102
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,100
And you promised me a surprise.
