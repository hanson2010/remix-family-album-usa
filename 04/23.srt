1
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,600
OK.

2
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Do you know how to play charades?

3
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Frank, you've never played charades?

4
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Nope.

5
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Carl, you're sure you've never played?

6
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,600
OK, Betty, Tim, and Frank.

7
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
We're going to play charades.

8
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Frank, you can learn as we go.

9
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
And, Carl, you join in at any time.

10
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,600
OK, let me think.

11
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,600
OK, I've got one.

12
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:48,600
All right.

13
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,600
A movie!

14
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
A movie!

15
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Right.

16
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
A movie.

17
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
OK.

18
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Six words.

19
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
It has six words.

20
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
That's easy.

21
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
I can play.

22
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Good. OK.

23
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
We've got a movie.

24
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
The title...

25
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Six words.

26
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Right.

27
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
First word ...

28
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Sounds like.

29
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Sounds like ...

30
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
You got that part right.

31
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Yes.

32
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Sounds like ...

33
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Sounds like what?

34
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Sounds like no.

35
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Absolutely right, Frank.

36
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Sounds like no.

37
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
OK.

38
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
We've got a movie.

39
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Six words.

40
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
The first word sounds like no.

41
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Row. Row.

42
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Go. Go

43
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Nope.

44
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Show.

45
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
That's it - show.

46
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
No... OK...

47
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Snow.

48
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Absolutely right, Betty.

49
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Sounds like no - snow.

50
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
OK, a movie. Six words.

51
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
The first word is snow.

52
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
This is fun.

53
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Oh, OK.

54
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,600
The fifth word.

55
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Right, fifth word.

56
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Seven?

57
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Absolutely right.

58
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Very good.

59
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
The fifth word is seven.

60
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
OK, we've got a movie.

61
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
The first word is snow.

62
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Fifth word, seven.

63
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
I got it!

64
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
I got it!

65
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

66
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,600
I got it.

67
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
I got it.

68
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Frank, you got it.

69
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Betty, you had it, but you didn't say it.

70
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
I knew it.

71
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Carl, now you know charades.

72
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Why don't you join us?

73
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
I don't like charades.

74
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
It's for babies.

75
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Oh, I like it.

76
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Well, they're babies.

77
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
You're a sore loser.

78
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Yeah.

79
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
No arguing.

80
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Save your voices.

81
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Between now and tomorrow

82
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
you're all going to have your tonsils out.

83
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
And you won't be able to speak for a while.

84
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
So save your voices till then.

85
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Hi, gang. Hi, everybody.

86
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Well, what's going on?

87
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I sure I am glad to see you, Dr. Stewart.

88
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
This is a rough group.

89
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,600
I didn't want to play charades,

90
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
so they're angry at me.

91
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Why don't you want to play?

92
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Because I don't want to be here.

93
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I don't want my tonsils out.

94
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Why not?

95
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Because my birthday is tomorrow.

96
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
My mother promised me a birthday party with a clown.

97
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
But you can have one when you go home, Carl.

98
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,600
But my birthday is tomorrow.

99
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
I'm sorry, Carl.

100
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Carl, you'll have your party when you go home,

101
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
But it won't be on my birthday!

102
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,600
And you promised me a surprise.
