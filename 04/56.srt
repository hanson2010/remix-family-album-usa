1
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
And now for... something old,

2
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
something new, something borrowed,

3
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
and something blue.

4
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
OK. Let's see.

5
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Something borrowed.

6
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
That's this dress. Borrowed from Marilyn.

7
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Something blue.

8
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
My wristband.

9
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,600
I wore it when I married your father.

10
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Oh, Mother. I forgot you still had it.

11
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,600
It's just so lovely.

12
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
I bought it in an antique shop

13
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
when I was about eighteen years old.

14
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,600
I saved it for my wedding day.

15
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,600
And you saved it for me, didn't you, Mother?

16
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Yes, honey. I did.

17
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Are we ever going to finish?

18
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:53,600
All right. OK.

19
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Something borrowed.

20
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
The wedding dress. And something blue.

21
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
The wristband. Something old?

22
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Something old.

23
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Right. What's old?

24
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Of course!

25
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Something old.

26
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
I had planned to wear them.

27
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:20,600
Grandma's pearls!

28
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Oh, Grandpa will be so pleased that you're wearing them.

29
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
I'm sure he misses Grandma on a day like this.

30
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Help me with them, Marilyn.

31
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
I've never worn them before.

32
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I've been saving them for today.

33
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Saving them for today?

34
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Oh, you're a real Stewart!

35
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Oh, there you go.

36
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Lovely!

37
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Lovely!

38
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Lovely!

39
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Something borrowed, something blue.

40
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Something old...

41
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,600
and now for something new.

42
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
The veil.

43
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Oh, it's so beautiful, Marilyn!

44
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,600
You really are a fabulous designer, Marilyn.

45
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Doesn't it look just right on Susan? Susan

46
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Perfect!

47
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
And when you both say "I do",

48
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Harry will lift this veil over your head

49
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,600
and kiss the bride.

50
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Oh, I'm so excited!

51
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
When you said "I do", Marilyn,

52
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,600
it suddenly became real.

53
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
That's all right, Susan.

54
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
You've got the wedding-day jitters!

55
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,600
In less than two hours,

56
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,600
you will be Mrs. Harry Bennett.

57
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Oh, that reminds me.

58
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
If we don't get dressed,

59
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
we won't be there

60
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,600
to see Susan become Mrs. Harry Bennett.

61
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Before you leave, do I look all right?

62
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,600
You never looked better.

63
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Mom.

64
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,600
She's right.

65
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,600
And that's dear little Max.

66
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Got to go and feed him.

67
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,600
What am I supposed to do?

68
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
Take off the veil,

69
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
kick off your shoes, and sit down.

70
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
We'll come upstairs and get you in a little while.

71
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Richard's going to take some wedding pictures

72
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
before the ceremony.

73
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
So just relax.

74
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Are you kidding? Relax?

75
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Susan Stewart...

76
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,600
you are about to become Susan Bennett

77
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Mrs. Harry Bennett.
