1
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,600
There's a conversation we have to finish.

2
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
What was it about?

3
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
It was about caring.

4
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Oh?

5
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Yes, caring.

6
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I said that it makes me feel good

7
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
that you care about Michelle.

8
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Well, I do care about Michelle.

9
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,600
And it makes me feel good that you care about me.

10
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
You know I do.

11
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,600
You're a... wonderful friend.

12
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
And it makes me feel good

13
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
that you care about us.

14
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Well ... well,

15
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
I do, Harry.

16
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,600
It's only natural that if I care about Michelle

17
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
and I care about you,

18
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
then I care about us.

19
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
It's OK, Susan.

20
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
We had this part of the conversation

21
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
before Michelle and her friends arrived.

22
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Now comes the good part.

23
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Like what?

24
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Well, assume that if you care about Michelle

25
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
and you care about me

26
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
and you care about us,

27
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
that we can talk about us.

28
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
I mean you and me.

29
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Isn't that right?

30
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,600
What are you trying to say, Harry?

31
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,600
What I'm trying to say ...

32
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,600
since this is so easy...

33
00:17:44,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Here are ten letters that express my feelings for you.

34
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Don't be silly, Harry.

35
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,600
You want a hint?

36
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
It's two words.

37
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
You're making the game harder.

38
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Can't you figure it out?

39
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Seven letters... two words...

40
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,600
that express the feelings that I feel for you in my heart.

41
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Harry, I get it!

42
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Well? Does that mean you'll marry me?

43
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Is that a proposal, or are we just playing a game?

44
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Sit down, Susan.

45
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:08,600
There's something I have to ask you.

46
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Susan, will you marry me? Susan

47
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,600
It's such an important decision.

48
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
There's so many things to talk about.

49
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,600
There are three things that have to be done first, Harry.

50
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Three things?

51
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,600
First, we have to decide where to live.

52
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Well, that's easy.

53
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
We talked about that earlier.

54
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
We'll live in New York.

55
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
All right.

56
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Second,

57
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,600
we have to talk to Michelle together about being married.

58
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
We'll do that immediately.

59
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
What's the third thing?

60
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,600
You have to ask for my father's permission.

61
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Absolutely!

62
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
But first things first.

63
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
We have to go pick up Michelle.

64
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Oh, I'm so happy, Harry!

65
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Not as happy as I am.
