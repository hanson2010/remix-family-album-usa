1
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
It's almost ten o'clock.

2
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,600
I've got to go. Tomorrow is Monday,

3
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
and work begins at eight in the morning for me.

4
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Oh, I'm so happy that Max is home.

5
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
He's the sweetest little thing.

6
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
I'll drive you to the station, dear.

7
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,600
You can catch the ten-twenty train to Grand Central Station.

8
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I'll drive Susan, dear.

9
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Thank you, Philip.

10
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Then Grandpa, Robbie,

11
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
and I can finish wrapping all these gifts.

12
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,600
It's so good to have you home again...

13
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,600
and to see Max asleep in his bassinet at home with us.

14
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,600
To be with our family and all that Stewart TLC.

15
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:29,600
TLC - tender loving care.

16
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,600
That's our motto.

17
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Did you see the washcloth

18
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,600
and the towels with the teddy bears on them?

19
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Alexandra and the Molinas sent them for Max.

20
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,600
It was so kind of them.

21
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Now Max has come into everyone's life.

22
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
The house is so alive with him here.

23
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,600
The welcome sign over the door.

24
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,600
The boxes of presents.

25
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
The M-A-X over his bassinet.

26
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Robbie put that there.

27
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Susan's teddy bear.

28
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,600
So cuddly. The beautiful crib from Mom and Dad.

29
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Oh, and Grandpa's baseball glove.

30
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,600
You know, it hung over my crib, too.

31
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,600
And it hung over Robbie's crib.

32
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Part of Grandpa's magic?

33
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Oh, that's not all.

34
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
It hung over Susan's crib.

35
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
The same baseball glove?

36
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,600
That's right. Grandpa hangs it there for good luck.

37
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
He says it always brought him good luck on the baseball team.

38
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,600
He believes it'll bring good luck to all the Stewart babies.

39
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
And then he takes it back

40
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
when Max is ready to use it?

41
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Yes,

42
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
and replaces it with a new glove

43
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
so the old one will be ready

44
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
for a new member of the Stewart family.

45
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Grandpa really loves his family, doesn't he?

46
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,600
So do I.

47
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,600
And so do I.

48
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:11,600
And so does Max.

49
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,600
After he eats!
