00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Hello. What can I do for you?

2
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Hi. Fill 'er up.

3
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
I need a full tank.

4
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Check the hood?

5
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
No, thanks.

6
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Whereabouts are you headed?

7
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Pete Waters's farm, near Chesterton.

8
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
I know it well.

9
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Pete Waters's lived around here almost as long as I have.

10
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,600
How long is it going to take for me to get there?

11
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
About fifteen minutes.

12
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
There's a shortcut - if you know it.

13
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
No, I don't.

14
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Could you tell me how to use the shortcut?

15
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Sure. You take the next left turn.

16
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
You'll see a stop sign.

17
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Make a right at the stop sign.

18
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Stay on that road, and you'll cross a blue bridge.

19
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Then you'll see a big old red barn.

20
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
That's the back of Pete Waters's place.

21
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,600
That's quite a difference from the directions that Pete sent me.

22
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Now, if you take that route, it's probably a lot simpler,

23
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
but it'll take you ten minutes longer.

24
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,600
OK. Let me repeat it.

25
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,600
I take the next left turn to the stop sign.

26
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Then a right across a blue bridge,

27
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,600
and then a big red barn.

28
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Can't miss it.

29
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,600
How much do I owe you?

30
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Well, that'll be eighteen dollars and seventy cents.

31
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,600
No charge for the cleanup.

32
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
It's on the house.

33
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Well, here's a twenty.

34
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Ah. OK. That's a dollar and thirty cents change.

35
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,600
There we go... will make twenty. Thanks.

36
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Thank you.

37
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
And thanks for the directions.

38
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
This must be Pete's barn.

39
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Turn right to the house.

40
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Hi.

41
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Hi. What can I do for you?

42
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Is this the Pete Waters farm?

43
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
It is.

44
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I'm a friend of Pete's.

45
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
I'm looking for the house.

46
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
It's just over yonder.

47
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Keep along this road

48
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
till you get to the end of the fence.

49
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
You'll see the chicken house.

50
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
His house is on the left.

51
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Well, thanks.

52
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,600
"Have gone to the railroad station.

53
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Back soon with a surprise.

54
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Make yourself at home.

55
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Have a look around. Pete."

56
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Same old Pete Waters.

57
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Always full of surprises.
