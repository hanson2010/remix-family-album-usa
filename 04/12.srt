1
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Grandpa, Ellen, Philip, Robbie, you and me.

2
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,100
That's six steaks.

3
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,100
Don't forget Susan.

4
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,100
Seven steaks.

5
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,100
Cooking dinner for the entire family is not so easy.

6
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,100
The shopping: the salad:

7
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:20,100
tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, and onions.

8
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:26,100
The main course: steak and potatoes.

9
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,100
Richard, how much broccoli do I need for seven people? Richard

10
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,100
Marilyn, I have to tell you something. Marilyn

11
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,100
At today's exercise class...

12
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
Yes, Richard.

13
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:46,100
Well, I didn't really exercise.

14
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
I knew it!

15
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,100
I wanted to, but Jack Davis needed a photographer.

16
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
I'm sorry, Marilyn.

17
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,100
I don't understand. Did you exercise or not?

18
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,100
No. Instead of exercising, I photographed the class.

19
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,100
And you didn't exercise?

20
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,100
No.

21
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:11,100
There's another advanced class today at four o'clock.

22
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,100
We'll go together.

23
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,100
What about the bet?

24
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:21,100
Oh, the bet is still on, but you shop for the groceries.

25
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:28,100
Remember, you win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

26
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,100
You win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

27
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Including Susan.

28
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Four o'clock at the advanced exercise class. With me.

29
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Don't forget to breathe.

30
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,100
Skip, hop, front.

31
00:16:53,100 --> 00:17:08,100
Twist... again.... OK, now... scissors.

32
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:16,100
This is fun. It's a piece of cake.

33
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,100
Yeah. Just wait.

34
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:27,100
5, 6, 7, go right, 1, 2, back, 5 6 7

35
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,100
2, 3 , 1, 2, 3, pony, pony... 2 3 1 2 33

36
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:37,100
1, 2, 3, kick... 1, 2, 3, kick... pony. 1 2 3

37
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:43,100
And twist, twist.

38
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
OK. Let's pick up the pace.

39
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
How are you doing, Richard?

40
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,100
I can barely move.

41
00:17:47,100 --> 00:18:01,100
2, 3, 4, front. Now we're going to run it off. 2 3 4

42
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Front... knees up, knees up.

43
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,100
OK. Finish off by jogging in place.

44
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,100
OK. Keep those knees up.

45
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,100
All right. That's it for today.

46
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,100
Thank you, everyone. See you next week.

47
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,100
Thank you, Jack, but no thank you.

48
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,100
The advanced exercise class is not so easy, huh?

49
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:27,100
No, no, you were right. I was wrong.

50
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:33,100
Come on, Richard. Get up. Let's go.

51
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,100
You have to cook dinner for the entire family.

52
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,100
Marilyn, I'm exhausted. I can't move. Marilyn

53
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,100
Oh, you'll do it. It's a piece of cake.

54
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,100
Excuse me, Richard, Marilyn.

55
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,100
You are a terrific instructor, Jack.

56
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Thanks. But I have a question.

57
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,100
Is this your very first advanced aerobics class?

58
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,100
Yes, it is.

59
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,100
You are in great shape, Richard.

60
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Very few people last in this class

61
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,100
for the full hour the very first time.

62
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,100
It's true. You are in great shape.

63
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
Thanks!

64
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:18,100
I think we'll cook dinner together.
