1
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Grandpa, Ellen, Philip, Robbie, you and me.

2
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
That's six steaks.

3
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Don't forget Susan.

4
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Seven steaks.

5
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Cooking dinner for the entire family is not so easy.

6
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,600
The shopping: the salad:

7
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,600
tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, and onions.

8
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,600
The main course: steak and potatoes.

9
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Richard, how much broccoli do I need for seven people?

10
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Marilyn, I have to tell you something.

11
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,600
At today's exercise class...

12
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Yes, Richard.

13
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Well, I didn't really exercise.

14
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
I knew it!

15
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,600
I wanted to, but Jack Davis needed a photographer.

16
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
I'm sorry, Marilyn.

17
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,600
I don't understand. Did you exercise or not?

18
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,600
No. Instead of exercising, I photographed the class.

19
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
And you didn't exercise?

20
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
No.

21
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:10,600
There's another advanced class today at four o'clock.

22
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
We'll go together.

23
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
What about the bet?

24
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Oh, the bet is still on, but you shop for the groceries.

25
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:27,600
Remember, you win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

26
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,600
You win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

27
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
Including Susan.

28
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Four o'clock at the advanced exercise class. With me.

29
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Don't forget to breathe.

30
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Skip, hop, front.

31
00:17:52,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Twist... again... OK, now... scissors.

32
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:15,600
This is fun. It's a piece of cake.

33
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Yeah. Just wait.

34
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:26,600
5, 6, 7, go right, 1, 2, back,

35
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,600
2, 3 , 1, 2, 3, pony, pony...

36
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:36,600
1, 2, 3, kick... 1, 2, 3, kick... pony.

37
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:42,600
And twist, twist.

38
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
OK. Let's pick up the pace.

39
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
How are you doing, Richard?

40
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
I can barely move.

41
00:18:46,600 --> 00:19:00,600
2, 3, 4, front. Now we're going to run it off.

42
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Front... knees up, knees up.

43
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
OK. Finish off by jogging in place.

44
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,600
OK. Keep those knees up.

45
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
All right. That's it for today.

46
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Thank you, everyone. See you next week.

47
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Thank you, Jack, but no thank you.

48
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,600
The advanced exercise class is not so easy, huh?

49
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:26,600
No, no, you were right. I was wrong.

50
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Come on, Richard. Get up. Let's go.

51
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,600
You have to cook dinner for the entire family.

52
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Marilyn, I'm exhausted. I can't move.

53
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Oh, you'll do it. It's a piece of cake.

54
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Excuse me, Richard, Marilyn.

55
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,600
You are a terrific instructor, Jack.

56
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Thanks. But I have a question.

57
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Is this your very first advanced aerobics class?

58
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Yes, it is.

59
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
You are in great shape, Richard.

60
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
Very few people last in this class

61
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,600
for the full hour the very first time.

62
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,600
It's true. You are in great shape.

63
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Thanks!

64
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,600
I think we'll cook dinner together.
