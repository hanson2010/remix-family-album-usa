1
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,000
Excuse me.

2
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
My name is Richard Stewart.

3
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm a photographer.

4
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
May I take a picture of you and your little boy?

5
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,500
What's it for?

6
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,600
It's for a book.

7
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
You're writing a book?

8
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
It's a book of pictures.

9
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
I call it Family Album, U.S.A.

10
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Oh, that's a nice idea.

11
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Well, it's fine if you take our picture.

12
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
I'm Martha Vann.

13
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Thank you. I appreciate your help.

14
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm Richard. What's your name?

15
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Gerald. Gerald

16
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
How old are you, Gerald?

17
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Five.

18
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
And where do you live?

19
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
We live in California.

20
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Well, welcome to New York.

21
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
OK, just a second.

22
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I'm almost ready here.

23
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Can I help you?

24
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Oh, please.

25
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Hold Gerald's hand, please.

26
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Great!

27
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Now point to the buildings.

28
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Terrific!

29
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Give Mommy a kiss, Gerald.

30
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Nice!

31
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Thank you, Gerald.

32
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,600
And thank you, Mrs. Vann.

33
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Oh, my pleasure.

34
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
We'll be looking for your book.

35
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Thank you. Good-bye. Bye, Gerald.

36
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Thanks again.

37
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Oh, you're welcome.

38
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Hey, let me take your picture!

39
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Wonderful. Please.

40
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Are you from New York?

41
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
No, I'm from Greece.

42
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
I'm an exchange student.

43
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
When did you come here?

44
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Three months ago.

45
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Your English is very good.

46
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Thanks.

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
I studied English in school.

48
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Would you like some coffee?

49
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
No, thank you.

50
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Tell me about your book.

51
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Oh, it's not finished yet,

52
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
but I have some of the pictures.

53
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Would you like to see them?

54
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Yes. I'd like that.

55
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Here they are.

56
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Family Album, U.S.A.

57
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
It's an album of pictures of the United States:

58
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
the cities, the special places, and the people.

59
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
And these are pictures of people working:

60
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:47,600
steelworkers, bankers, police, street vendors,

61
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:55,600
ambulance drivers, doctors...

62
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Oh, this is my father. He's a doctor.

63
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,600
This is my mother.

64
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
What's her name?

65
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Ellen.

66
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,600
My younger brother, Robbie.

67
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
He goes to high school.

68
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
This is my sister Susan.

69
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,600
She works for a toy company.

70
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Here's my grandfather.

71
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
He lives in Florida.

72
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
And this is my wife Marilyn.

73
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Oh, she's very pretty.

74
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Thanks. And what about your family?

75
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
They are in Thessaloniki.

76
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,600
That's a large city in northern Greece.

77
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
But now I'm living in the Bronx.

78
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
With a Greek-American family?

79
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
No. Hispanic.

80
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Oh no! It's five thirty.

81
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Will you excuse me?

82
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
I have to meet my wife.

83
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
It was nice meeting you.

84
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
It was a pleasure meeting you, too.

85
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Thanks for your help.

86
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,600
And good luck! I've got to go.

87
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
By the way, I'm Richard.

88
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
What's your name?

89
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Alexandra.

90
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Bye-bye, Alexandra. Thanks.

91
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Bye-bye.

92
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Richard! Richard!

93
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
You left your bag!
