1
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Don't tell me.

2
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Please don't tell me.

3
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
I recognize you...

4
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Oh, don't be silly, Arnie.

5
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Of course you recognize him.

6
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Except for the beard, he hasn't changed in fifty years.

7
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
It's Malcolm Stewart!

8
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
I know it's Malcolm Stewart.

9
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
You haven't changed much in fifty years.

10
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Peggy... Peggy Pendleton!

11
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
You're Peggy Pendleton!

12
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Who am I, you old rascal?

13
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
You don't recognize me, do you?

14
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
I know who you are.

15
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
You're Arnold Franklin!

16
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
I know who you are!

17
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,600
You look wonderful, Malcolm!

18
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Sit down. Sit down.

19
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Pete isn't home. Pete

20
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Really?

21
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,600
No. He left a note on the door

22
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,600
saying he was going to the railroad station

23
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
to pick up a surprise.

24
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
He's so funny.

25
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Always full of surprises,

26
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
even fifty years later.

27
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,600
The two of you look unbelievable!

28
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
How's your family?

29
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Oh, I was sorry

30
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
to hear about your wife having passed away.

31
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Yes. About four years ago.

32
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
And you're living with your children now? In New York?

33
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Pete wrote us and told us.

34
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Yup.

35
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Retired and moved to New York

36
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
to live with my son and his family.

37
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
By the way,

38
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
what do you think this big surprise is?

39
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,600
It could be most anything, knowing Pete.

40
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Hey, that must be Pete!

41
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Now we'll find out about the surprise.

42
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,600
So good to see you all!

43
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Oh, Pete, Pete!

44
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Oh, it's so good to see you!

45
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Remember Lillian?

46
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
I remember all of you.

47
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
You haven't changed a bit.

48
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Lillian! Oh, my gosh!

49
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Lillian Winters.

50
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
We were together in the Thursday night drama society.

51
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Remember me, Malcolm?

52
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Oh, beautiful as ever, Lillian.

53
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
How's Donald?

54
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
That's OK, Malcolm.

55
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Donald passed away a couple of years ago.

56
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Sorry to hear that, Lillian.

57
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Oh, I'm so sorry.

58
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
I would not have missed this get-together for the world!

59
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
And your little surprise, Pete?

60
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
You really surprised me

61
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
by having us all come together.

62
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,600
You don't know what the surprise is yet?

63
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Come on!

64
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,600
We'll tell you the big surprise.

65
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:08,600
I've invited you here for the weekend to help celebrate.

66
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Celebrate?

67
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Our fiftieth reunion?

68
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
No.

69
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
No. Pete wants to tell you ...

70
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Now, let me have the honor, Lillian.

71
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
For goodness' sake, Pete, tell us!

72
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
I can't wait much longer.

73
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Well, I am pouring this iced tea

74
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,600
so that we can toast Lillian and me.

75
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,600
You don't mean to tell me that you and...

76
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Yes, I do.

77
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,600
I have loved Lillian all these years,

78
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,600
so I asked her to be Mrs. Pete Waters.

79
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
And I said yes.

80
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,600
I knew it! I knew it!

81
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Congratulations!

82
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Oh, Lillian,

83
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
I am so happy for you both.

84
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
It's wonderful!

85
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
It's wonderful for me.

86
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Lillian will make me a happy man, finally.

87
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
You are full of surprises, Pete.

88
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
We are going to

89
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,600
spend the entire weekend having a good time together here

90
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
on the farm.

91
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,600
We are going to celebrate all weekend.

92
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
When is the wedding?

93
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,600
That's another surprise.

94
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Lillian and I were married two weeks ago in Detroit.

95
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,600
She's come here to stay.

96
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Wait till I tell my family about this!

97
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Why, that's wonderful!
