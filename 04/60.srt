1
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Good morning.

2
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
What a wonderful morning!

3
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Don't the flowers smell wonderful?

4
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Good morning, Ellen.

5
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Yes, they do.

6
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,600
That's why I'm reading my paper and having my coffee

7
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
on the patio this morning.

8
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Ah, it does smell sweet.

9
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,600
How was your school-board meeting last night?

10
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
You must've come home very late.

11
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Did you find the sandwich I made for you?

12
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Thanks, dear.

13
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,600
I was so tired

14
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
I didn't even finish it.

15
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Philip, I've been working on this special project

16
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
with the school board,

17
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
and I'd like your opinion about it.

18
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
What is it?

19
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
I've been trying to find

20
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
a way to encourage reading.

21
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Good luck!

22
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Well, I think I may have found a way to do it.

23
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Tell me about it.

24
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,600
I work with families every day, Ellen.

25
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
I see how people spend their leisure time,

26
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
young and old.

27
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Mostly watching television.

28
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Well, that would be OK

29
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
if, and I repeat,

30
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
if people took the time to read.

31
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
I couldn't agree with you more.

32
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
The question is,

33
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,600
how do we get them to read more?

34
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
I think

35
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,600
you're going to give me the answer to that question.

36
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
You have that look in your eye.

37
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
I do have an answer, Philip.

38
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Or at least I think I do.

39
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Well, tell me about it.

40
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
The plan is a simple one.

41
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Involve the entire family in a reading project.

42
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
In the home?

43
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Yes, in the home.

44
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
But first in the school-rooms.

45
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Hmm, interesting.

46
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,600
But how do you plan to do that?

47
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
By arranging with the public schools

48
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,600
to schedule one hour a week to start with.

49
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
During that time

50
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
parents are invited to attend--

51
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,600
and to read along with the children - their children.

52
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,600
It can go beyond the school system, Ellen.

53
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Really?

54
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:30,600
I guarantee you it would go very well in the hospitals.

55
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
My patients, mostly kids,

56
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
would love to read and be read to.

57
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
You think so?

58
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
I know so.

59
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Maybe we can experiment with your patients

60
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,600
and see how the plan works.

61
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
I love the idea.

62
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Would you work with me on it?

63
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,600
I would love to, Philip.

64
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,600
And that way,

65
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,600
we'll spend more time together, Ellen.

66
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,600
We just don't see each other anymore.

67
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,600
You and I are very busy these days.

68
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
This is true.

69
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
We need to find time to be together more,

70
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
to do things together more, you and I.

71
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,600
This would be a wonderful way to accomplish that.

72
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
I have a question.

73
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Yes?

74
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,600
What do we read?

75
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
To the patients in the ward?

76
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Yes.

77
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Well,

78
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
let you and I talk about it.

79
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,600
What would you like to read to them?

80
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Mrs. Stewart and I Stewart

81
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
will read a poem by Robert Frost.

82
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
It's called

83
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening".

84
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Would you begin, Ellen?

85
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
All right.

86
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,600
"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"

87
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,600
by Robert Frost.

88
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Whose woods these are I think I know.

89
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
His house is in the village though;

90
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
He will not see me stopping here

91
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
To watch his woods fill up with snow.

92
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,600
My little horse must think it queer

93
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
To stop without a farmhouse near

94
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Between the woods and frozen lake

95
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,600
The darkest evening of the year.

96
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
He gives his harness bells a shake

97
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
To ask if there is some mistake.

98
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,600
The only other sound's the sweep

99
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Of easy wind and downy flake.

100
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,600
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,

101
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
But I have promises to keep,

102
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,600
And miles to go before I sleep,

103
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,600
And miles to go before I sleep.

104
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:03,600
You two belong on stage! That was wonderful!

105
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Grandpa!

106
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Dad... Robbie. When did you come?

107
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
We've been listening to you both.

108
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
These are lucky kids.

109
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Do you enjoy reading together?

110
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Well, we may read together aloud at home.

111
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
You were right, Robbie.

112
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
I know.
