1
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Sorry, Robbie.

2
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Sorry to be late this morning,but,

3
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,600
well, we've still got some time for a cup of coffee

4
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
I can't wait to see my old pal Charley Rafer.

5
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Neither can I.

6
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:37,600
So you thought about it, huh?

7
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Yes, I have, Dad.

8
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Well, I'm glad.

9
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
I knew you'd realize

10
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
that this interview could be an important experience for you.

11
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
I came to that conclusion.

12
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
That's very wise, Robbie.

13
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Very wise.

14
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Now let's head off for the city and the university club.

15
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Thanks, Dad.

16
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Thanks... for what?

17
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Thanks for hearing me out. And ...

18
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
And...?

19
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,600
And thanks for being such an understanding father.

20
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Well, thank you, Robbie. Thank you.

21
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Philip Stewart!

22
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
It's great to see you!

23
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Charley Rafer, you look as young as ever.

24
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,600
You must be Robbie.

25
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Hi.

26
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Yes, this is my youngest son Robbie.

27
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Robbie, I want you to meet

28
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,600
one of the best tennis players on the Michigan team -

29
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Charley Rafer.

30
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Nice to meet you, Dean Rafer.

31
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Well, are you as good a tennis player as your dad?

32
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
No, I'm not very good at it.

33
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Frankly, neither was I.

34
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Charley was the star of the team.

35
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Yeah. Thanks.

36
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Well, how're you been, Philip?

37
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Oh, working too hard.

38
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Doesn't show.

39
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
How's Ellen?

40
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Fine, thank you.

41
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
And how's Marge?

42
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,600
She's still giving the toughest English history exams

43
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,600
in the school and loving every minute of it.

44
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
And speaking of minutes,

45
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
I have interviews until noon,

46
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
so why don't we get right to work?

47
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Can you have lunch with us later?

48
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
I'd love to, Philip, but I'm afraid I can't.

49
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
I'm only here two days,

50
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
and I have interviews with twenty-six applicants.

51
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
I understand.

52
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Well, thanks.

53
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
I'll wait outside.

54
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
Good luck, Son.

55
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Did you bring your transcript from high school?

56
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Yes, sir.

57
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Right here.

58
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Thank you.

59
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Please sit down.

60
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,600
I see under "activities" that

61
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
you've been writing for the school paper.

62
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Yes, sir.

63
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
What kinds of articles have you written?

64
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,600
All kinds - sports, editorials, theater reviews.

65
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
You name it, I've written it.

66
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Hmmm.

67
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Well, have you ever thought of becoming a journalist?

68
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
A professional writer?

69
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Not until recently.

70
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Michigan has a fine School of Journalism.

71
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Yes, I know that.

72
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,600
You seem to have some reservations.

73
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
I'm a little uncertain.

74
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,600
It's been very nice talking to you.

75
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Nice talking to you, sir.

76
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
One piece of advice.

77
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,600
The most important thing is for you to decide your own future.

78
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Yes, sir.

79
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Good-bye, Dean Rafer.

80
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Good-bye, Robbie.

81
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Good luck.
