1
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,100
Sorry, Robbie.

2
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,100
Sorry to be late this morning,but,

3
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,100
well, we've still got some time for a cup of coffee

4
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,100
I can't wait to see my old pal Charley Rafer.

5
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,100
Neither can I.

6
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:12,100
So you thought about it, huh?

7
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Yes, I have, Dad.

8
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Well, I'm glad.

9
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100
I knew you'd realize

10
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,100
that this interview could be an important experience for you.

11
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,100
I came to that conclusion.

12
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,100
That's very wise, Robbie.

13
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
Very wise.

14
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,100
Now let's head off for the city and the university club.

15
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Thanks, Dad.

16
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
Thanks ... for what?

17
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
Thanks for hearing me out. And ...

18
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
And ...?

19
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,100
And thanks for being such an understanding father.

20
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Well, thank you, Robbie. Thank you.

21
00:09:45,100 --> 00:10:00,100
Philip Stewart! Philip Stewart

22
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,100
It's great to see you!

23
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Charley Rafer--you look as young as ever. Charley Rafer

24
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,100
You must be Robbie.

25
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,100
Hi.

26
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Yes, this is my youngest son Robbie.

27
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Robbie, I want you to meet Robbie

28
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,100
one of the best tennis players on the Michigan team--

29
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
Charley Rafer. Charley Rafer

30
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
Nice to meet you, Dean Rafer.

31
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,100
Well, are you as good a tennis player as your dad?

32
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
No, I'm not very good at it.

33
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Frankly, neither was I.

34
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Charley was the star of the team. Charley

35
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
Yeah. Thanks.

36
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,100
Well, how're you been, Philip?

37
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Oh, working too hard.

38
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Doesn't show.

39
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
How's Ellen? Ellen

40
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Fine, thank you.

41
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,100
And how's Marge? Marge

42
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,100
She's still giving the toughest English history exams

43
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,100
in the school and loving every minute of it.

44
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
And speaking of minutes,

45
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
I have interviews until noon,

46
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
so why don't we get right to work?

47
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Can you have lunch with us later?

48
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,100
I'd love to, Philip, but I'm afraid I can't.

49
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100
I'm only here two days,

50
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,100
and I have interviews with twenty-six applicants.

51
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
I understand.

52
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,100
Well, thanks.

53
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,100
I'll wait outside.

54
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,100
Good luck, Son.

55
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,100
Did you bring your transcript from high school?

56
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Yes, sir.

57
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Right here.

58
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,100
Thank you.

59
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Please sit down.

60
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,100
I see under "activities" that

61
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
you've been writing for the school paper.

62
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
Yes, sir.

63
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,100
What kinds of articles have you written?

64
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,100
All kinds--sports, editorials, theater reviews.

65
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
You name it, I've written it.

66
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
Hmmm.

67
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Well, have you ever thought of becoming a journalist?

68
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
A professional writer?

69
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Not until recently.

70
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Michigan has a fine School of Journalism. Michigan

71
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Yes, I know that.

72
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,100
You seem to have some reservations.

73
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,100
I'm a little uncertain.

74
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,100
It's been very nice talking to you.

75
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,100
Nice talking to you, sir.

76
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
One piece of advice.

77
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:13,100
The most important thing is for you to decide your own future.

78
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,100
Yes, sir.

79
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,100
Good-bye, Dean Rafer.

80
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Good-bye, Robbie.

81
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Good luck.
