00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,100
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Amtrak is happy to announce our arrival in New York City.

3
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,100
The train will be stopping in five minutes.

4
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,100
Please check to be sure you have your belongings.

5
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,100
And have a good stay in the Big Apple.

6
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
Thank you.

7
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
Well, here we are.

8
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,100
It was so nice meeting you, Mr. Stewart.

9
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,100
And nice meeting you, too, Mrs. Tobin.

10
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,100
Please look us up.

11
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
We're in the phone book.

12
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Dr. Philip Stewart, in Riverdale. Philip Stewarrt

13
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Your son?

14
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,100
That's right. And have a good time in New York.

15
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,100
And don't be so independent.

16
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,100
You're very lucky to have a caring family.

17
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:46,100
When can we go fishing?

18
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,100
Robbie, we'll go fishing soon, Robbie

19
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,100
and we'll take your dad with us.

20
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,100
I'm ready, Grandpa. You name the day.

21
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
That's a great idea, Grandpa!

22
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Philip needs a day off. Philip

23
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Let's give him our presents--now.

24
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,100
Good idea.

25
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,100
Presents--for me?

26
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:10,100
From me and Marilyn. Marilyn

27
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
And this one's from me.

28
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,100
I looked all over the house to find it.

29
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Richard, these are terrific pictures. Richard

30
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:44,100
This one really brings back memories.

31
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,100
You remember that day, Robbie?

32
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,100
I sure do. It was fun.

33
00:16:50,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Oh, I'm sorry Susan isn't here.

34
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
I miss her very much.

35
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,100
She feels bad, too, Grandpa.

36
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,100
She called to say the plane was delayed.

37
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,100
You know airports.

38
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
I can't wait to see her.

39
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,100
She looks just like Grandma at that age.

40
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,100
I'd better unpack.

41
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,100
I started traveling twenty-four hours ago.

42
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,100
I'm not so young anymore.

43
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,100
Don't you want something to eat?

44
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,100
No, thanks.

45
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,100
After a good night's sleep, I'll enjoy breakfast even more.

46
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
Well, come on, Dad.

47
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Ellen and I'll take you to your room. Ellen

48
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,100
I'm sure glad you're here, Grandpa.

49
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Good night, Grandpa.

50
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
Pleasant dreams.

51
00:17:46,100 --> 00:18:05,100
Philip, do you have the key to the trunk? Philip

52
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,100
I have the key, but it doesn't work.

53
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:17,100
I sent the wrong key.

54
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:33,100
I have something for you. I made it myself.

55
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,100
I think you'll enjoy it.

56
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,100
I researched it for over a year.

57
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,100
It's our family tree.

58
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:51,100
Oh, Grandpa! How exciting!

59
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Fabulous!

60
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,100
Why, I didn't know that your grandfather was born in Germany.

61
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,100
Lots of interesting information about our family.

62
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,100
A gift from me.

63
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,100
Thank you so much.

64
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Grandpa! Grandpa!

65
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,100
Oh, Grandpa, I'm so happy to see you!

66
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Oh, you look so beautiful, Susan. My granddaughter.

67
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:24,100
Like I always said, you look just like Grandma.

68
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,100
I think you're going to be very happy here with us.

69
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,100
I know you will.

70
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:46,100
I don't feel alone anymore.
