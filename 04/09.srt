00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Amtrak is happy to announce our arrival in New York City.

3
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,600
The train will be stopping in five minutes.

4
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Please check to be sure you have your belongings.

5
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
And have a good stay in the Big Apple.

6
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Thank you.

7
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Well, here we are.

8
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,600
It was so nice meeting you, Mr. Stewart.

9
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,600
And nice meeting you, too, Mrs. Tobin.

10
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Please look us up.

11
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
We're in the phone book.

12
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Dr. Philip Stewart, in Riverdale.

13
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Your son?

14
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,600
That's right. And have a good time in New York.

15
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,600
And don't be so independent.

16
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,600
You're very lucky to have a caring family.

17
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:55,600
When can we go fishing?

18
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Robbie, we'll go fishing soon,

19
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
and we'll take your dad with us.

20
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,600
I'm ready, Grandpa. You name the day.

21
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
That's a great idea, Grandpa!

22
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Philip needs a day off.

23
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Let's give him our presents now.

24
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Good idea.

25
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Presents, for me?

26
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,600
From me and Marilyn.

27
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
And this one's from me.

28
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,600
I looked all over the house to find it.

29
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Richard, these are terrific pictures.

30
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:53,600
This one really brings back memories.

31
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,600
You remember that day, Robbie?

32
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
I sure do. It was fun.

33
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Oh, I'm sorry Susan isn't here.

34
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
I miss her very much.

35
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,600
She feels bad, too, Grandpa.

36
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,600
She called to say the plane was delayed.

37
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
You know airports.

38
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
I can't wait to see her.

39
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,600
She looks just like Grandma at that age.

40
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,600
I'd better unpack.

41
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,600
I started traveling twenty-four hours ago.

42
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,600
I'm not so young anymore.

43
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Don't you want something to eat?

44
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
No, thanks.

45
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
After a good night's sleep, I'll enjoy breakfast even more.

46
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Well, come on, Dad.

47
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Ellen and I'll take you to your room.

48
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
I'm sure glad you're here, Grandpa.

49
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Good night, Grandpa.

50
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Pleasant dreams.

51
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Philip, do you have the key to the trunk?

52
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,600
I have the key, but it doesn't work.

53
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:26,600
I sent the wrong key.

54
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:42,600
I have something for you. I made it myself.

55
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
I think you'll enjoy it.

56
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,600
I researched it for over a year.

57
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
It's our family tree.

58
00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Oh, Grandpa! How exciting!

59
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Fabulous!

60
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Why, I didn't know that your grandfather was born in Germany.

61
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Lots of interesting information about our family.

62
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
A gift from me.

63
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Thank you so much.

64
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Grandpa! Grandpa!

65
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Oh, Grandpa, I'm so happy to see you!

66
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Oh, you look so beautiful, Susan. My granddaughter.

67
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Like I always said, you look just like Grandma.

68
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,600
I think you're going to be very happy here with us.

69
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I know you will.

70
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:55,600
I don't feel alone anymore.
