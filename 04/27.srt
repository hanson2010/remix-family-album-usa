1
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,000
I had an interview today, too.

2
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I had a great interview

3
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,600
with Admissions at Columbia University.

4
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Really?

5
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
What did they say?

6
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Will you get into the school?

7
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Well, they didn't say anything for sure.

8
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,600
But I figure that with my grades and with my personality,

9
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
I'll have no problem.

10
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Columbia's a terrific school.

11
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
What are you going to do?

12
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Do? I don't know.

13
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
I also applied to NYU.

14
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
You sound excited about Columbia.

15
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
What's your problem, Mike?

16
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Indecision. Indecision.

17
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
It's not easy,

18
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
and this is an important decision we have to make.

19
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
What about you?

20
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
How was your interview with Michigan?

21
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
The interview was fine.

22
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
It's a great college.

23
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
It is.

24
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
My father would like me to go there.

25
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
He and my Grandpa both went there.

26
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Great medical school, too.

27
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
I know.

28
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
You can follow in your father's footsteps.

29
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Ah! I'd like to follow in my own footsteps, Mike.

30
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
What do you want to study?

31
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
I've been thinking.

32
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I think I want to study journalism

33
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,600
to be a reporter--a newspaperman.

34
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
You do a pretty good job on the Riverdale High School paper.

35
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,600
And I've been thinking about it a lot lately.

36
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Have you discussed it with your parents?

37
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,600
No. But I have to.

38
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
OK. Let's talk.

39
00:16:50,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Hi, Son. Is everything all right?

40
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Hi, Dad. Everything's fine.

41
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,600
I was just waiting for you to get home

42
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
so we could talk.

43
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Anything special you want to talk about?

44
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,600
There is, Dad.

45
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
I'm listening.

46
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Well, I know you and Mom have given up a lot

47
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,600
to save money for my college tuition.

48
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,600
We want you to go to college, Robbie.

49
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
I know. I do.

50
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,600
But?

51
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,600
Well, I've thought a lot about which college,

52
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,600
and one of them is Columbia.

53
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Columbia? Why Columbia?

54
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,600
First, they have an excellent School of Journalism.

55
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,600
They do.

56
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,600
And your friends are planning to go to Columbia?

57
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
That's only part of it.

58
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
It's complicated.

59
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,600
I'll try to explain.

60
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Mike and I had a hamburger this afternoon, and we talked.

61
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Yes?

62
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Well, we talked about a lot of things.

63
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
He applied to Columbia,

64
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
and his interview was very successful.

65
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
He thinks he'll be accepted,

66
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
and he really wants to go there.

67
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Dean Rafer called me today.

68
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,600
He told me he was very impressed with you.

69
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
He's a nice man.

70
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
He was very kind.

71
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,600
He told me

72
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,600
you had some doubts about wanting to go to Michigan.

73
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Yes. I do.

74
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,600
I'm just not sure about what I want to do.

75
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
That's OK.

76
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,600
You understand?

77
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
Let me tell you something, Robbie.

78
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Something that might be surprising to you.

79
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
What? Tell me.

80
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Well, Grandpa wanted me to study engineering, like him.

81
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Well, I wasn't clear about my future,

82
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,600
but I knew engineering was not for me.

83
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,600
What did you tell Grandpa?

84
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
The truth.

85
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Then you're not upset

86
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
about my not wanting to go into medicine?

87
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,600
I'm not upset at all.

88
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,600
I'm just happy that we're able to talk about it.

89
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I am too, Dad.

90
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,600
I suppose you want to apply to Columbia.

91
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Yes, but I also want to apply to several other colleges.

92
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,600
I thought you wanted to go to Columbia.

93
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Well, I might want to go to Columbia.

94
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
But I might not.

95
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,600
I just want to be able to make my own decision.

96
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,600
You're a real Stewart!

97
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,600
And if I think about it long enough, you never know...

98
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Never know what?

99
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
If I make my own decision,

100
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,600
I might choose Michigan.

101
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Robbie, you're something!

102
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,600
You know, when I was your age,

103
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,600
I said exactly the same thing to Grandpa.
