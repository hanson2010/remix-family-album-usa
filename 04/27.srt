1
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,500
I had an interview today, too.

2
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
I had a great interview

3
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,100
with Admissions at Columbia University.

4
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Really?

5
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
What did they say?

6
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
Will you get into the school?

7
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
Well, they didn't say anything for sure.

8
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,100
But I figure that with my grades and with my personality,

9
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,100
I'll have no problem.

10
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Columbia's a terrific school. Columbia

11
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
What are you going to do?

12
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,100
Do? I don't know.

13
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
I also applied to NYU.

14
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,100
You sound excited about Columbia.

15
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
What's your problem, Mike?

16
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Indecision. Indecision.

17
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,100
It's not easy,

18
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
and this is an important decision we have to make.

19
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
What about you?

20
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,100
How was your interview with Michigan?

21
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
The interview was fine.

22
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,100
It's a great college.

23
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,100
It is.

24
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,100
My father would like me to go there.

25
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,100
He and my Grandpa both went there.

26
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,100
Great medical school, too.

27
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
I know.

28
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
You can follow in your father's footsteps.

29
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Ah! I'd like to follow in my own footsteps, Mike.

30
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,100
What do you want to study?

31
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,100
I've been thinking.

32
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
I think I want to study journalism

33
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,100
to be a reporter--a newspaperman.

34
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
You do a pretty good job on the Riverdale High School paper.

35
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,100
And I've been thinking about it a lot lately.

36
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Have you discussed it with your parents?

37
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,100
No. But I have to.

38
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
OK. Let's talk.

39
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Hi, Son. Is everything all right?

40
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,100
Hi, Dad. Everything's fine.

41
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,100
I was just waiting for you to get home

42
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,100
so we could talk.

43
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
Anything special you want to talk about?

44
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,100
There is, Dad.

45
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,100
I'm listening.

46
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,100
Well, I know you and Mom have given up a lot

47
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:57,100
to save money for my college tuition.

48
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,100
We want you to go to college, Robbie.

49
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,100
I know. I do.

50
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
But?

51
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Well, I've thought a lot about which college,

52
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,100
and one of them is Columbia.

53
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Columbia? Why Columbia? Columbia

54
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,100
First, they have an excellent School of Journalism.

55
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,100
They do.

56
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:27,100
And your friends are planning to go to Columbia?

57
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,100
That's only part of it.

58
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,100
It's complicated.

59
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,100
I'll try to explain.

60
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Mike and I had a hamburger this afternoon, and we talked.

61
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
Yes?

62
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,100
Well, we talked about a lot of things.

63
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
He applied to Columbia,

64
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
and his interview was very successful.

65
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
He thinks he'll be accepted,

66
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
and he really wants to go there.

67
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Dean Rafer called me today. Rafer

68
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,100
He told me he was very impressed with you.

69
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
He's a nice man.

70
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
He was very kind.

71
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
He told me

72
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,100
you had some doubts about wanting to go to Michigan.

73
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Yes. I do.

74
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,100
I'm just not sure about what I want to do.

75
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,100
That's OK.

76
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,100
You understand?

77
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,100
Let me tell you something, Robbie.

78
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:30,100
Something that might be surprising to you.

79
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,100
What? Tell me.

80
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Well, Grandpa wanted me to study engineering, like him.

81
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,100
Well, I wasn't clear about my future,

82
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:51,100
but I knew engineering was not for me.

83
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,100
What did you tell Grandpa?

84
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
The truth.

85
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,100
Then you're not upset

86
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,100
about my not wanting to go into medicine?

87
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,100
I'm not upset at all.

88
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,100
I'm just happy that we're able to talk about it.

89
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,100
I am too, Dad.

90
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:18,100
I suppose you want to apply to Columbia.

91
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,100
Yes, but I also want to apply to several other colleges.

92
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,100
I thought you wanted to go to Columbia.

93
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Well, I might want to go to Columbia.

94
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,100
But I might not.

95
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,100
I just want to be able to make my own decision.

96
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,100
You're a real Stewart!

97
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,100
And if I think about it long enough, you never know ...

98
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
Never know what?

99
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,100
If I make my own decision,

100
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,100
I might choose Michigan.

101
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Robbie, you're something! Robbie

102
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,100
You know, when I was your age,

103
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,100
I said exactly the same thing to Grandpa.
