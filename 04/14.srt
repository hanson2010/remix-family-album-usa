1
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,100
This is really neat!

2
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,100
When do we eat?

3
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,100
First, we have to catch some fish.

4
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:10,100
In order to catch fish, you have to do this.

5
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Here we go.

6
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
That's it.

7
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Then drop it into the water.

8
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,100
All of this comes before eating. OK?

9
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,100
How do you know so much about fishing?

10
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
Grandpa taught me.

11
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
We spent a lot of time fishing together.

12
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Now, the important thing is to get the hook close to the fish.

13
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
All right?

14
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Like this.

15
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:55,100
I think I see some fish right under us, Dad.

16
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,100
Oh, not a chance!

17
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,100
I just saw a big one!

18
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
Hi, there!

19
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
Hi.

20
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,100
What's your name?

21
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Albert. Albert

22
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Are you all alone?

23
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
Yes, sir.

24
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,100
How old are you, Albert?

25
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,100
I'm ten.

26
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,100
Where's your father?

27
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
He's up there at the lodge.

28
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Does he know you're here?

29
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
Yes, sir.

30
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,100
OK, Robbie, maybe you should watch him. Robbie

31
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,100
The water's pretty deep here.

32
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
I'll watch him, Dad.

33
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:37,100
What time is it?

34
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,100
It's almost lunchtime, and no fish yet.

35
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,100
I can go up to the lodge for some hot dogs and drinks.

36
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,100
No way!

37
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
We're here to catch our lunch.

38
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,100
To catch fish, you need the right magic.

39
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,100
That's right.

40
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,100
I forgot!

41
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
The right magic.

42
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
Do it for Robbie, Dad.

43
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,100
You remember?

44
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,100
Sure. Come on.

45
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,100
Well, first, you have to turn your hat around like this.

46
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,100
Then you close your eyes and say the magic words.

47
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,100
Fish, fish, send me a fish.

48
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Fish, fish, send me a fish.... I got one!

49
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,100
See, it works!

50
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,100
It's a big one!

51
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,100
Well, it always worked for me, too.

52
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,100
Grandpa, get the net, please!

53
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:42,100
Dad, you got one, too!

54
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,100
You bet I have!

55
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,100
Easy, Philip, easy.

56
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Sorry, Dad.

57
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,100
Well, one more and I've got a pair of boots.

58
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,100
You didn't say the magic words.

59
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Robbie's right. Robbie

60
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
Yes, but you did, and we've got our lunch.

61
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Let's build a fire and cook it!

62
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Come on, Albert, you can help us!

63
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
I want to stay here and fish.

64
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,100
All right, but be careful.

65
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:24,100
Is it finished yet?

66
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,100
I think so.

67
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,100
I hope you like your fish well done.

68
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Burned, you mean.

69
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Hey, I'm a doctor, not a chef.

70
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:47,100
Help! Help! I can't swim!

71
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Dad! Grandpa! He fell in!

72
00:12:49,100 --> 00:13:10,100
Easy does it, Robbie.

73
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
That a boy.

74
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
That's it.

75
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,100
He's not breathing, Philip!

76
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
Robbie, run to the car! Robbie

77
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,100
Bring a blanket and my medical bag.

78
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,100
Yes, Dad.

79
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,100
Now, come on, son. Come on, son.

80
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,100
Breathe, Albert!
