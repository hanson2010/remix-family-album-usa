1
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,600
This is really neat!

2
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,600
When do we eat?

3
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,600
First, we have to catch some fish.

4
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,600
In order to catch fish, you have to do this.

5
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Here we go.

6
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
That's it.

7
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Then drop it into the water.

8
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,600
All of this comes before eating. OK?

9
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,600
How do you know so much about fishing?

10
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Grandpa taught me.

11
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
We spent a lot of time fishing together.

12
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Now, the important thing is to get the hook close to the fish.

13
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
All right?

14
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Like this.

15
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:54,600
I think I see some fish right under us, Dad.

16
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Oh, not a chance!

17
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
I just saw a big one!

18
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Hi, there!

19
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Hi.

20
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
What's your name?

21
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Albert.

22
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Are you all alone?

23
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Yes, sir.

24
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,600
How old are you, Albert?

25
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
I'm ten.

26
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Where's your father?

27
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
He's up there at the lodge.

28
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Does he know you're here?

29
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Yes, sir.

30
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,600
OK, Robbie, maybe you should watch him.

31
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
The water's pretty deep here.

32
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
I'll watch him, Dad.

33
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:36,600
What time is it?

34
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,600
It's almost lunchtime, and no fish yet.

35
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I can go up to the lodge for some hot dogs and drinks.

36
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
No way!

37
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
We're here to catch our lunch.

38
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,600
To catch fish, you need the right magic.

39
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
That's right.

40
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
I forgot!

41
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
The right magic.

42
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Do it for Robbie, Dad.

43
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
You remember?

44
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Sure. Come on.

45
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Well, first, you have to turn your hat around like this.

46
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Then you close your eyes and say the magic words.

47
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Fish, fish, send me a fish.

48
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Fish, fish, send me a fish... I got one!

49
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
See, it works!

50
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
It's a big one!

51
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Well, it always worked for me, too.

52
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Grandpa, get the net, please!

53
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Dad, you got one, too!

54
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
You bet I have!

55
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Easy, Philip, easy.

56
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Sorry, Dad.

57
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Well, one more and I've got a pair of boots.

58
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,600
You didn't say the magic words.

59
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Robbie's right.

60
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Yes, but you did, and we've got our lunch.

61
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Let's build a fire and cook it!

62
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Come on, Albert, you can help us!

63
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
I want to stay here and fish.

64
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,600
All right, but be careful.

65
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:23,600
Is it finished yet?

66
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
I think so.

67
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
I hope you like your fish well done.

68
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Burned, you mean.

69
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Hey, I'm a doctor, not a chef.

70
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Help! Help! I can't swim!

71
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Dad! Grandpa! He fell in!

72
00:12:48,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Easy does it, Robbie.

73
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
That a boy.

74
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
That's it.

75
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
He's not breathing, Philip!

76
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Robbie, run to the car!

77
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Bring a blanket and my medical bag.

78
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Yes, Dad.

79
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Now, come on, son. Come on, son.

80
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Breathe, Albert!
