00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Hello there, Robbie.

2
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
What are you doing up this late?

3
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Reading.

4
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Reading?

5
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
At this hour?

6
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Ah, come on, Robbie.

7
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
What are you doing up this late?

8
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,600
Things on my mind.

9
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Do you care to talk about them?

10
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Sure,

11
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
if you don't mind listening.

12
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Robbie, Robbie, remember me?

13
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
I'm your mother.

14
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,600
If you have something you want to talk about,

15
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
I'm always prepared to listen.

16
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,600
You haven't been around much lately.

17
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,600
So that's it.

18
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
OK, let's talk.

19
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,600
You and Dad are like ships that pass in the night.

20
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Dad works hard, and he works late.

21
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
You work hard on all your committees,

22
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
and you work late.

23
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
I thought you were proud of the work I do.

24
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
I am, Mom.

25
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Real proud.

26
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,600
You are one fantastic mom,

27
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,600
but ... but I've been noticing

28
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
how little quality time

29
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
you spend with Dad and me... and the family.

30
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,600
It's a real problem, Robbie.

31
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
I know it.

32
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,600
I'm concerned.

33
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
There must be a way

34
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,600
that Dad and you can spend more time together.

35
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Well, we always talk about

36
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
taking a vacation together with the family.

37
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,600
I think you ought to

38
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,600
take a vacation away from the family, alone.

39
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Kind of a second honeymoon.

40
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,600
It would be wonderful,

41
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
but our schedules won't allow it.

42
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
I think I have an idea.

43
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
You do?

44
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Yup.

45
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
I think I have an idea

46
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
that will bring Dad and you

47
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
together in a more scheduled way.

48
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
What is it?

49
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Well,

50
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
you know how Dad is always talking about

51
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
the kids in the ward

52
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,600
and how important it is for them to be paid attention to?

53
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Yes.

54
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Well...

55
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
and how hard it is

56
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
because the doctors and nurses are so busy?

57
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Yes.

58
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Well, how would it be if you took some time

59
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
to work with Dad towards solving that problem?

60
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
I don't get it.

61
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Like setting up a regular weekly reading program.

62
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
You and Dad.

63
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
You and Dr. Philip Stewart--

64
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
going to the children's ward once or twice a week

65
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
and reading to them.

66
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Not bad.

67
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Not a bad idea, Robbie.

68
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
As a matter of fact,

69
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
it fits right in with something I'm working on right now

70
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
with the school-board committee.

71
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
What's that?

72
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
I've been trying

73
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
to work out a program

74
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
in the public school

75
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,600
that will bring parents and teachers together once a week

76
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,600
to read to the students - their own children, really.

77
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
By doing that, it will encourage reading.

78
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,600
So it might fit in with a program

79
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
for reading to the kids in the hospital.

80
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
You're right.

81
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
We'll do it!

82
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
I'm going to talk to Daddy about it right now.

83
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,600
But Dad was so exhausted when he came home from work.

84
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Why don't you talk to him about it tomorrow?

85
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,600
You are a very smart young man, Robbie.

86
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,600
I think I'll wait until tomorrow.

87
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
You won't forget, will you?

88
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Believe me, I won't.

89
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
It is a great idea,

90
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
and I promise you I won't forget.

91
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Thanks, Mom.

92
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Thank you, Robbie.
