1
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:45,600
OK, everybody.

2
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,600
I want to welcome Harry and his daughter Michelle

3
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
to Thanksgiving with us.

4
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Thank you, Dr. Stewart.

5
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Call me Philip.

6
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
OK.

7
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
But first, I think we should take a moment

8
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
and remember the meaning of Thanksgiving.

9
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Philip, I took Michelle to a school play Philip

10
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
about the first Thanksgiving.

11
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Well, why don't you tell us about that, Michelle?

12
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Thanksgiving was about the Pilgrims,

13
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
the first settlers in America.

14
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
They shared the first harvest with the Indians

15
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
and gave thanks.

16
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
All right.

17
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Then in that spirit let each of us give thanks.

18
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Each in his own way.

19
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Who wants to begin?

20
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
I will.

21
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,600
I give thanks for being here with my family and for being well,

22
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
so I can enjoy you all.

23
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
All right!

24
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
We love you, Grandpa.

25
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:40,600
I'd like to give thanks for a healthy year, a good job,

26
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,600
and for meeting Harry and Michelle.

27
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
We'd like to give thanks for meeting Susan

28
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
and the Stewart family.

29
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
I love you, Daddy.

30
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Thanks, Harry.

31
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
That was very kind of you.

32
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,600
I'd like to give thanks for Grandpa coming to live with us.

33
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,600
And I'd also like to thank my math teacher

34
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
for giving me a passing grade.

35
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,600
And call me, Alexandra.

36
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Oh, Robbie!

37
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
She'll call.

38
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
You go first, Marilyn.

39
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
I'm thinking.

40
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
You go first.

41
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:17,600
Well, you all know I'm working on my photo album.

42
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
It's not finished yet.

43
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,600
And I'd like to thank Marilyn for being so patient.

44
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Thanks, Richard.

45
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
I should thank you for encouraging me

46
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
to keep working on my fashion designs.

47
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,600
I'm lucky to have a husband with an artistic eye.

48
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Oh, we have a lot to be thankful for.

49
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,600
For the food on this table.

50
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Just like the Pilgrims.

51
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
I'll go along with that, Ellen.

52
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Well, help me serve, Robbie.

53
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,600
It was a wonderful meal, Mrs. Stewart.

54
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Thank you.

55
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
And now to see the end of the football game.

56
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Exactly.

57
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Where are you going, Philip?

58
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Remember, the Michigan football game?

59
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
And Michigan needs a touchdown.

60
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Did you forget something?

61
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Dad, your famous apple pie.

62
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Just let me see the score, Ellen.

63
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Go ahead, Philip.

64
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
We should all take a little break before dessert.

65
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Oh, who could that be?

66
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Oh, it must be Alexandra.

67
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
I invited her to come by for dessert.

68
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
You did?

69
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
I like Ellen.

70
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
You know everyone, Alexandra.

71
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,600
No, she doesn't know Harry Bennett and his daughter Michelle.

72
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Nice to meet you.

73
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Hi.

74
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Hi.

75
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Hello, Alexandra.

76
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Hi, Marilyn.

77
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,000
Hi, Susan.

78
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,600
Happy Thanksgiving.

79
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,600
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie.

80
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Please sit down, Alexandra.

81
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Dad, Richard, Alexandra's here.

82
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Michigan needs a touchdown.

83
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Three minutes to play.

84
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Hi, Alexandra. Welcome.

85
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Hello, Alexandra.

86
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Yes, Michigan needs a touchdown.

87
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,600
One tiny little touchdown, with just three minutes to play.

88
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
You want Michigan to win.

89
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
How'd you guess?

90
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,600
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie.

91
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:25,600
What happened?

92
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,600
We forgot to turn the oven on.

93
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,600
We did?

94
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Philip, why don't you go

95
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
watch the last three minutes of the game.

96
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I will serve coffee and pumpkin pie.

97
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
OK. I'll be back in a few minutes.

98
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Robbie, would you bring the dessert plates.

99
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
And, Marilyn, would you pour coffee, please.

100
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Sure, Ellen.

101
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,600
How was your Thanksgiving dinner, Alexandra?

102
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Just wonderful, Mr. Stewart.

103
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,600
The Molinas are a large family.

104
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,601
I love being with them.

105
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,602
I'm glad you came by, Alexandra.

106
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,603
I am, too.

107
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:11,604
Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!

108
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,605
Great Thanksgiving.

109
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,606
Lots to be thankful for.

110
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,607
Michigan scored a touchdown.

111
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,608
Alexandra came by.

112
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,609
And nobody misses Philip's famous apple pie.

113
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,610
Oh, Grandpa!
