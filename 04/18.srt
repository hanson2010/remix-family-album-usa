1
00:14:38,100 --> 00:15:02,100
OK, everybody.

2
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,100
I want to welcome Harry and his daughter Michelle

3
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
to Thanksgiving with us.

4
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
Thank you, Dr. Stewart.

5
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Call me Philip.

6
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
OK.

7
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
But first, I think we should take a moment

8
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
and remember the meaning of Thanksgiving.

9
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,100
Philip, I took Michelle to a school play Philip

10
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,100
about the first Thanksgiving.

11
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Well, why don't you tell us about that, Michelle?

12
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
Thanksgiving was about the Pilgrims,

13
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,100
the first settlers in America.

14
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
They shared the first harvest with the Indians

15
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,100
and gave thanks.

16
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
All right.

17
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,100
Then in that spirit let each of us give thanks.

18
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Each in his own way.

19
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
Who wants to begin?

20
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,100
I will.

21
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:45,100
I give thanks for being here with my family and for being well,

22
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,100
so I can enjoy you all.

23
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
All rihgt!

24
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,100
We love you, Grandpa.

25
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:57,100
I'd like to give thanks for a healthy year, a good job,

26
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,100
and for meeting Harry and Michelle.

27
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,100
We'd like to give thanks for meeting Susan

28
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,100
and the Stewart family.

29
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,100
I love you, Daddy.

30
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Thanks, Harry.

31
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100
That was very kind of you.

32
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,100
I'd like to give thanks for Grandpa coming to live with us.

33
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,100
And I'd also like to thank my math teacher

34
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
for giving me a passing grade.

35
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,100
And call me, Alexandra.

36
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,100
Oh, Robbie!

37
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,100
She'll call.

38
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
You go first, Marilyn.

39
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,100
I'm thinking.

40
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,100
You go first.

41
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Well, you all know I'm working on my photo album.

42
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
It's not finished yet.

43
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,100
And I'd like to thank Marilyn for being so patient.

44
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,100
Thanks, Richard.

45
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
I should thank you for encouraging me

46
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100
to keep working on my fashion designs.

47
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,100
I'm lucky to have a husband with an artistic eye.

48
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Oh, we have a lot to be thankful for.

49
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,100
For the food on this table.

50
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,100
Just like the Pilgrims.

51
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,100
I'll go along with that, Ellen.

52
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Well, help me serve, Robbie.

53
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:09,100
It was a wonderful meal, Mrs. Stewart.

54
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,100
Thank you.

55
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
And now to see the end of the football game.

56
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,100
Exactly.

57
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Where are you going, Philip?

58
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,100
Remember, the Michigan football game?

59
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,100
And Michigan needs a touchdown. Michigan

60
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,100
Did you forget something?

61
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
Dad, your famous apple pie.

62
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,100
Just let me see the score, Ellen.

63
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,100
Go ahead, Philip.

64
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
We should all take a little break before dessert.

65
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Oh, who could that be?

66
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Oh, it must be Alexandra.

67
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
I invited her to come by for dessert.

68
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
You did?

69
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,100
I like Ellen.

70
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
You know everyone, Alexandra.

71
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,100
No, she doesn't know Harry Bennett and his daughter Michelle.

72
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,100
Nice to meet you.

73
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,100
Hi.

74
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Hi.

75
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,100
Hello, Alexandra.

76
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
Hi, Marilyn.

77
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,500
Hi, Susan.

78
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,100
Happy Thanksgiving.

79
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,100
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie. Alexandra

80
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,100
Please sit down, Alexandra.

81
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,100
Dad, Richard--Alexandra's here.

82
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
Michigan needs a touchdown. Michigan

83
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
Three minutes to play.

84
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Hi, Alexandra. Welcome.

85
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,100
Hello, Alexandra.

86
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
Yes, Michigan needs a touchdown.

87
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,100
One tiny little touchdown, with just three minutes to play.

88
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
You want Michigan to win.

89
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,100
How'd you guess?

90
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,100
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie. Alexandra

91
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:42,100
What happened?

92
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,100
We forgot to turn the oven on.

93
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,100
We did?

94
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100
Philip, why don't you go Philip

95
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
watch the last three minutes of the game.

96
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,100
I will serve coffee and pumpkin pie.

97
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,100
OK. I'll be back in a few minutes.

98
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Robbie, would you bring the dessert plates. Robbie

99
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
And, Marilyn, would you pour coffee, please. Marilyn

100
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
Sure, Ellen.

101
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:11,100
How was your Thanksgiving dinner, Alexandra?

102
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
Just wonderful, Mr. Stewart.

103
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,100
The Molinas are a large family. Molina

104
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,101
I love being with them.

105
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,102
I'm glad you came by, Alexandra.

106
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,103
I am, too.

107
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:28,104
Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!

108
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,105
Great Thanksgiving.

109
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,106
Lots to be thankful for.

110
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,107
Michigan scored a touchdown. Michigan

111
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,108
Alexandra came by. Alexandra

112
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,109
And nobody misses Philip's famous apple pie.

113
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,110
Oh, Grandpa!
