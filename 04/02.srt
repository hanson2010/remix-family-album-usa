1
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Excuse me, officer. Can you help me?

2
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,200
Sure.

3
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
Can you tell me how to get to Linden Street in Riverdale?

4
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Richard Stewart, 46 Linden Street, Riverdale, New York.

5
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You should take the number 1 subway.

6
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Is there a station near here?

7
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yes. The station's that way.

8
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You should take the number 1 train to Van Cortlandt Park.

9
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Number 1 train to Van Cortlandt Park. Thank you.

10
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Anytime. Good luck.

11
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Remember, the number 1 train. The uptown platform.

12
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Thank you.

13
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You're welcome.

14
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,000
Is this pink too bright for me?

15
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Mmm-hmm. It is a very bright pink.

16
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Try this. It's size eight.

17
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But I wear size ten.

18
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
How about green? It's size ten.

19
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Let me try it on.

20
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm taking too much of your time.

21
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's six o'clock.

22
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Where's my husband?

23
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,300
Where's my husband?

24
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,000
I was expecting him here at five forty-five.

25
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Don't worry. The traffic is very heavy at this hour.

26
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I know. But we're going to be late for dinner.

27
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'll take this green sweater.

28
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I like the color on me, don't you?

29
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I think it looks terrific on you.

30
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm sorry I'm so late.

31
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I had a really bad day.

32
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's ten after six. We're late.

33
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Robbie's cooking tonight, and dinner's at six thirty.

34
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I know. I know. I'm really sorry.

35
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I left my bag of film on the ferry.

36
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I went back for it, but the ferry was gone.

37
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I lost a whole day's work.

38
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'll call the Staten Island Ferry lost-and-found office.

39
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I didn't think of that. Thanks.

40
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,000
Hello.

41
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yes. The number, please,

42
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
of the Staten Island Ferry lost-and-found office.

43
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Five five five... zero eight zero eight.

44
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Thank you.

45
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I really appreciate it, Marilyn.

46
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I really appreciate it, Marilyn.

47
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Hello.

48
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Did anyone find a camera bag this afternoon,

49
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
a small canvas bag,

50
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
on the J. F. Kennedy Ferry? No?

51
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Maybe someone will find it.

52
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The name is Stewart, Richard Stewart.

53
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And the telephone number is five five five...

54
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
three oh nine oh. Thank you.

55
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Sorry, Richard. They don't have it.

56
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Thanks, anyway.

57
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
There was a girl on the ferry.

58
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Now maybe...

59
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Tell me about it on the way home.
