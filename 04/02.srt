1
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Excuse me, officer. Can you help me?

2
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:07,700
Sure.

3
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,500
Can you tell me how to get to Linden Street in Riverdale?

4
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Richard Stewart, 46 Linden Street, Riverdale, New York.

5
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
You should take the number 1 subway.

6
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Is there a station near here?

7
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Yes. The station's that way.

8
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
You should take the number 1 train to Van Cortlandt Park.

9
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Number 1 train to Van Cortlandt Park. Thank you.

10
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Anytime. Good luck.

11
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Remember, the number 1 train. The uptown platform.

12
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Thank you.

13
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
You're welcome.

14
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Is this pink too bright for me?

15
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Mmm-hmm. It is a very bright pink.

16
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Try this. It's size eight.

17
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,500
But I wear size ten.

18
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,500
How about green? It's size ten.

19
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
Let me try it on.

20
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,500
I'm taking too much of your time.

21
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,500
It's six o'clock.

22
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Where's my husband?

23
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:23,800
Where's my husband?

24
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,500
I was expecting him here at five forty-five.

25
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Don't worry. The traffic is very heavy at this hour.

26
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,500
I know. But we're going to be late for dinner.

27
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,500
I'll take this green sweater.

28
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
I like the color on me, don't you?

29
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
I think it looks terrific on you.

30
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:44,500
I'm sorry I'm so late.

31
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
I had a really bad day.

32
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,500
It's ten after six. We're late.

33
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
Robbie's cooking tonight, and dinner's at six thirty.

34
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
I know. I know. I'm really sorry.

35
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,500
I left my bag of film on the ferry.

36
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
I went back for it, but the ferry was gone.

37
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
I lost a whole day's work.

38
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,500
I'll call the Staten Island Ferry lost-and-found office.

39
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
I didn't think of that. Thanks.

40
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Hello.

41
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Yes. The number, please,

42
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
of the Staten Island Ferry lost-and-found office. Staten

43
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:25,500
Five five five...zero eight zero eight. 555-

44
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Thank you.

45
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
I really appreciate it, Marilyn.

46
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
I really appreciate it, Marilyn.

47
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Hello.

48
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Did anyone find a camera bag this afternoon,

49
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,500
a small canvas bag,

50
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,500
on the J. F. Kennedy Ferry?...No?

51
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Maybe someone will find it.

52
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,500
The name is Stewart, Richard Stewart.

53
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,500
And the telephone number is five five five...

54
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
three oh nine oh. Thank you.

55
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Sorry, Richard. They don't have it.

56
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Thanks, anyway.

57
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,500
There was a girl on the ferry.

58
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Now maybe...

59
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Tell me about it on the way home.
