1
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,600
OK, Philip. This is your third cup of coffee.

2
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
We should get to work,

3
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
or we won't be finished by dinnertime.

4
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
I guess we must.

5
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
We must.

6
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:30,600
OK. The beginning of my famous Thanksgiving apple pie.

7
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:37,600
One apple. Two apples. Three apples. Four apples.

8
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Come on, Philip!

9
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Get busy with your famous apple pie.

10
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
There's much more to be done.

11
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Now, the ingredients.

12
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,600
What goes into my apple pie besides apples?

13
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Ah, yes. Flour, sugar, butter.

14
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Butter, nice and cold and hard.

15
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
OK, here are the walnuts.

16
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Last but not least,

17
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,600
the reason my apple pie is famous - cinnamon.

18
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Cinnamon.

19
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Ellen, where's the cinnamon?

20
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
If there is any cinnamon,

21
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
it's in the cabinet with the salt and pepper.

22
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Salt, pepper, dill weed, garlic powder, cinnamon. Ellen?

23
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Yes, Philip.

24
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Is it possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon?

25
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Yes, it is possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon.

26
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Well, how can I make my famous apple pie without cinnamon?

27
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Good morning.

28
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Oh, hi, Robbie. Good morning.

29
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Good morning. Robbie.

30
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Can you do me a favor?

31
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Sure, Dad. What?

32
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Remember my apple pie on Thanksgiving?

33
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
What do you love about it?

34
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
The apples?

35
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
No. The sssss...

36
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Right. We don't have any cinnamon.

37
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
I'll go down to Henry's grocery. He's always open.

38
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
I'll get some for you.

39
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
That's my boy!

40
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Oh, put your heavy jacket on, Robbie.

41
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
It's cold outside.

42
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Alexandra might call.

43
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Tell her I'll call her right back.

44
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
OK.

45
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Thanks, Son.

46
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Uh, why does he always have to slam the door?

47
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Hello... Hello, Alexandra. How are you? Fine.

48
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Robbie just went to the store.

49
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
He'll be back soon.

50
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
He said he'll call you.

51
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Oh, oh, I see... Oh... certainly.

52
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Well, do you have the phone number there?

53
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Oh... I see... Please, I know he wants to talk to you...

54
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Thank you,

55
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,600
and happy Thanksgiving to you and your family, too.

56
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Try to come by later for dessert. Bye.

57
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,600
That was Alexandra.

58
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
She and the Molinas

59
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
are going to spend Thanksgiving with their cousins.

60
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
She doesn't have the phone number.

61
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Oh, Robbie will be disappointed.

62
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
He'll be grouchy.

63
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Maybe she'll call back. She promised.

64
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Here's your cinnamon, Pop.

65
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:09,600
It was a dollar and sixty cents.

66
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,600
You forgot to ask me for the change.

67
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Or did you forget to give it to me?

68
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Thanks, Son.

69
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Alexandra called.

70
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
I'll call her back.

71
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
She said she'll call you later.

72
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
She's not at home.

73
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:48,600
You should have your breakfast, Son.

74
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Make you feel better.

75
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Protein, vitamins.

76
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
She said she'll call back?

77
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Yes, she did.

78
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,600
Good morning, everyone!

79
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Happy Turkey Day!

80
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,600
What's wrong?

81
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

82
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,600
What's gotten into him?

83
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
He missed a phone call.

84
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
From...?

85
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Yes, Alexandra.

86
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:21,600
It's nice to see young love... Oh, to be young again!

87
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Where's the coffee?
