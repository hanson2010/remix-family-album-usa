1
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,600
OK, Philip. This is your third cup of coffee.

2
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,600
We should get to work,

3
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
or we won't be finished by dinnertime.

4
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,600
I guess we must.

5
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
We must.

6
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:15,600
OK. The beginning of my famous Thanksgiving apple pie.

7
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,600
One apple. Two apples. Three apples. Four apples.

8
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Come on, Philip!

9
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Get busy with your famous apple pie.

10
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
There's much more to be done.

11
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Now, the ingredients.

12
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,600
What goes into my apple pie besides apples?

13
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Ah, yes. Flour, sugar, butter.

14
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Butter, nice and cold and hard.

15
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
OK, here are the walnuts.

16
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Last but not least,

17
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,600
the reason my apple pie is famous--cinnamon.

18
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Cinnamon ...

19
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Ellen, where's the cinnamon? Ellen

20
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
If there is any cinnamon,

21
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
it's in the cabinet with the salt and pepper.

22
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Salt, pepper, dill weed, garlic powder, cinnamon. Ellen?

23
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Yes, Philip.

24
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Is it possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon?

25
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Yes, it is possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon.

26
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Well, how can I make my famous apple pie without cinnamon?

27
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Good morning.

28
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Oh, hi, Robbie. Good morning.

29
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Good morning. Robbie.

30
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Can you do me a favor?

31
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Sure, Dad. What?

32
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Remember my apple pie on Thanksgiving?

33
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,600
What do you love about it?

34
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
The apples?

35
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
No. The sssss...

36
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Right. We don't have any cinnamon.

37
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
I'll go down to Henry's grocery. He's always open.

38
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
I'll get some for you.

39
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
That's my boy!

40
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Oh, put your heavy jacket on, Robbie.

41
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
It's cold outside.

42
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Alexandra might call. Alexandra

43
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Tell her I'll call her right back.

44
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
OK.

45
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Thanks, Son.

46
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Uh, why does he always have to slam the door?

47
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Hello.... Hello, Alexandra. How are you? ... Fine.

48
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Robbie just went to the store. Robbie

49
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
He'll be back soon.

50
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
He said he'll call you.

51
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,600
... Oh, oh, I see.... Oh ... certainly.

52
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Well, do you have the phone number there?

53
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,600
... Oh ... I see.... Please, I know he wants to talk to you....

54
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Thank you,

55
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,600
and happy Thanksgiving to you and your family, too.

56
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Try to come by later for dessert.... Bye.

57
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,600
That was Alexandra.

58
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
She and the Molinas

59
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
are going to spend Thanksgiving with their cousins.

60
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
She doesn't have the phone number.

61
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Oh, Robbie will be disappointed.

62
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
He'll be grouchy.

63
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Maybe she'll call back. She promised.

64
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Here's your cinnamon, Pop.

65
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:54,600
It was a dollar and sixty cents.

66
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,600
You forgot to ask me for the change.

67
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Or did you forget to give it to me?

68
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Thanks, Son.

69
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Alexandra called. Alexandra

70
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
I'll call her back.

71
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
She said she'll call you later.

72
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
She's not at home.

73
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:33,600
You should have your breakfast, Son.

74
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Make you feel better.

75
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Protein, vitamins.

76
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
She said she'll call back?

77
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Yes, she did.

78
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Good morning, everyone!

79
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Happy Turkey Day!

80
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,600
What's wrong?

81
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

82
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,600
What's gotten into him?

83
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
He missed a phone call.

84
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
From ...?

85
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Yes, Alexandra.

86
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:06,600
It's nice to see young love.... Oh, to be young again!

87
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Where's the coffee?
