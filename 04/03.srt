1
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,500
And give her a teaspoon of the medicine after every meal.

2
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

3
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,500
You're welcome. Good-bye.

4
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:27,500
How are you?

5
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
I'm tired and hungry.

6
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Well, Marilyn and Richard called.

7
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
They'll be here soon, and then we'll eat.

8
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,500
All right. Is...is Susan coming?

9
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Well, she'll be here later.

10
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
She has to work late tonight.

11
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
And what's Robbie cooking for dinner? Robbie

12
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,500
It's a surprise.

13
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,500
I hope it's pasta.

14
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Robbie, the dinner was terrific. Robbie

15
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Yes, it was delicious.

16
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,500
What's for dessert?

17
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Oh, I forgot dessert.

18
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Robbie! Robbie

19
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Don't worry.

20
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
We've got lots of ice cream.

21
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Oh, I'd love some ice cream.

22
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Well, there's chocolate and coffee and a little vanilla.

23
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
I'll have vanilla.

24
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Is that all right with everyone?

25
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
I'll have chocolate.

26
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Me, too.

27
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Uh, one scoop of coffee

28
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
and one scoop of chocolate for me.

29
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,500
Robbie, will you help me serve? Robbie

30
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:43,500
I keep thinking about that bag of film. Eight rolls.

31
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,500
A whole day's work.

32
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
And good stuff, too.

33
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Don't worry, Richard.

34
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Somenoe will find it.

35
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,500
I'll get it. Hello.

36
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Hello.

37
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Does Richard Stewart live here? Richard Stewart

38
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Yes, he's my brother.

39
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
I'm Robbie...Robbie Stewart.

40
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,500
I'm Alexandra Pappas.

41
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
How do you do?

42
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Your brother left his bag of film on the ferryboat.

43
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,500
I found it.

44
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
I'm really glad to see you.

45
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,500
I mean...my brother'll be really glad to see you!

46
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Robbie! Who is it? Robbie

47
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,500
It's Richard's film! Richard

48
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,500
I mean, Alexandra Pappas.

49
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Come in, please.

50
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Alexandra! Alexandra

51
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
Hello, Richard. I found your bag!

52
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

53
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Um...Alexandra, let me introduce you.

54
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
This is my wife Marilyn.

55
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Richard showed me your photo. Richard

56
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
How do you do?

57
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Oh yes.

58
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
Richard told us all about you. Richard

59
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
It's nice to meet you.

60
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
And this is my mother, Ellen Stewart.

61
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,500
How do you do?

62
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
And my father, Dr. Philip Stewart.

63
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Nice to meet you, Alexandra.

64
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
And...ah...you met Robbie.

65
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Yes. And you must be Susan. Hi.

66
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Hi. Welcome.

67
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
I'm so glad you found the bag

68
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
and took the time and trouble to return it.

69
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Oh, it was no trouble.

70
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
I just took the wrong train.

71
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Would you like something to eat?

72
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Thank you, no.

73
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
I'm late for dinner at my house.

74
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
I really have to go.

75
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Would you like to call home?

76
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
I'd appreciate that.

77
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Please, use the phone.

78
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
Thanks. Excuse me.

79
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,500
Alexandra's a high-school exchange student from Greece. Alexandra

80
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Where does she live?

81
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
With a family in the Bronx.

82
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Oh, that's not too far from here!

83
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Take it easy, Robbie.

84
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Thank you.

85
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
I can only stay a few minutes.

86
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Have some iced tea.

87
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Thanks, Mrs. Stewart.

88
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Please sit down, Alexandra.

89
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:05,500
So, you're an exchange student.

90
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,500
Where do you go to school?

91
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,500
At the Bronx High School of Science.

92
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Oh, that's a very good school.

93
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
What are your favorite subjects?

94
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Biology and mathematics.

95
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Richard tells me you're a doctor. Richard

96
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
Yes, a pediatrician.

97
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
And what does your father do?

98
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,500
He's a lawyer, in Thessaloniki.

99
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Would you like some pasta?

100
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
I made it myself.

101
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
It might be a little cold.

102
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,500
Thanks, no. I do have to go.

103
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
It was nice meeting you all.

104
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Well, maybe you'll come for lunch some Sunday,

105
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
so we can really thank you

106
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
for bringing Richard's bag back.

107
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
Maybe.

108
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
You're welcome anytime.

109
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Good-bye.

110
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:52,500
Can I drive you home?

111
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,500
No, thanks.

112
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
The train is just up the street.

113
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
It won't take me long at all.

114
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Well, you really saved the day for me, Alexandra.

115
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Bye.

116
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Bye-bye.

117
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,500
Good night.

118
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:13,500
She's a smart young lady, and very nice.

119
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Very! Hey, she forgot her bag!

120
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,500
I guess we'll be seeing Alexandra again.

121
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Right, Robbie?
