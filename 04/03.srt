1
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And give her a teaspoon of the medicine after every meal.

2
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

3
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You're welcome. Good-bye.

4
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:27,000
How are you?

5
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm tired and hungry.

6
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Well, Marilyn and Richard called.

7
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They'll be here soon, and then we'll eat.

8
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
All right. Is... is Susan coming?

9
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Well, she'll be here later.

10
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
She has to work late tonight.

11
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And what's Robbie cooking for dinner?

12
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's a surprise.

13
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I hope it's pasta.

14
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Robbie, the dinner was terrific.

15
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yes, it was delicious.

16
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What's for dessert?

17
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh, I forgot dessert.

18
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Robbie!

19
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Don't worry.

20
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We've got lots of ice cream.

21
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh, I'd love some ice cream.

22
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Well, there's chocolate and coffee and a little vanilla.

23
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'll have vanilla.

24
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Is that all right with everyone?

25
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'll have chocolate.

26
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Me, too.

27
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Uh, one scoop of coffee

28
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and one scoop of chocolate for me.

29
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Robbie, will you help me serve?

30
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:43,000
I keep thinking about that bag of film. Eight rolls.

31
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
A whole day's work.

32
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And good stuff, too.

33
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Don't worry, Richard.

34
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Someone will find it.

35
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'll get it. Hello.

36
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Hello.

37
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Does Richard Stewart live here?

38
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yes, he's my brother.

39
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm Robbie... Robbie Stewart.

40
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm Alexandra Pappas.

41
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
How do you do?

42
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Your brother left his bag of film on the ferryboat.

43
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I found it.

44
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm really glad to see you.

45
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I mean... my brother'll be really glad to see you!

46
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Robbie! Who is it?

47
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's Richard's film!

48
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I mean, Alexandra Pappas.

49
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Come in, please.

50
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Alexandra!

51
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Hello, Richard. I found your bag!

52
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

53
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Um... Alexandra, let me introduce you.

54
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
This is my wife Marilyn.

55
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Richard showed me your photo.

56
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
How do you do?

57
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Oh yes.

58
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Richard told us all about you.

59
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's nice to meet you.

60
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And this is my mother, Ellen Stewart.

61
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How do you do?

62
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And my father, Dr. Philip Stewart.

63
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Nice to meet you, Alexandra.

64
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And... ah... you met Robbie.

65
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yes. And you must be Susan. Hi.

66
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Hi. Welcome.

67
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm so glad you found the bag

68
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and took the time and trouble to return it.

69
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh, it was no trouble.

70
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I just took the wrong train.

71
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Would you like something to eat?

72
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Thank you, no.

73
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm late for dinner at my house.

74
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I really have to go.

75
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Would you like to call home?

76
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'd appreciate that.

77
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Please, use the phone.

78
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Thanks. Excuse me.

79
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Alexandra is a high-school exchange student from Greece.

80
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Where does she live?

81
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
With a family in the Bronx.

82
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh, that's not too far from here!

83
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Take it easy, Robbie.

84
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Thank you.

85
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I can only stay a few minutes.

86
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Have some iced tea.

87
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Thanks, Mrs. Stewart.

88
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Please sit down, Alexandra.

89
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So, you're an exchange student.

90
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Where do you go to school?

91
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
At the Bronx High School of Science.

92
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Oh, that's a very good school.

93
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
What are your favorite subjects?

94
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Biology and mathematics.

95
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Richard tells me you're a doctor.

96
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yes, a pediatrician.

97
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And what does your father do?

98
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
He's a lawyer, in Thessaloniki.

99
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Would you like some pasta?

100
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I made it myself.

101
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It might be a little cold.

102
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Thanks, no. I do have to go.

103
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It was nice meeting you all.

104
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Well, maybe you'll come for lunch some Sunday,

105
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
so we can really thank you

106
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
for bringing Richard's bag back.

107
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Maybe.

108
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You're welcome anytime.

109
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Good-bye.

110
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Can I drive you home?

111
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
No, thanks.

112
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
The train is just up the street.

113
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It won't take me long at all.

114
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Well, you really saved the day for me, Alexandra.

115
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Bye.

116
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Bye-bye.

117
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Good night.

118
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:13,000
She's a smart young lady, and very nice.

119
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Very! Hey, she forgot her bag!

120
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I guess we'll be seeing Alexandra again.

121
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Right, Robbie?
