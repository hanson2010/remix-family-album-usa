1
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Here are the fliers, hot off the press!

2
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Looks good.

3
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Simple.

4
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Right over here, Grandpa.

5
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
You fold the fliers.

6
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Richard and I will put them into the envelopes.

7
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
We finished addressing over three hundred envelopes.

8
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Need another box?

9
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Good work, gang.

10
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Hi, this is Mike Johnson.

11
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs. Anderson?

12
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Mr. Nelson.

13
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Hi. This is Robbie Stewart.

14
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Did you know

15
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
my mother is running for the school board?

16
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Yes, Miss Kim, Ellen Stewart.

17
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
"She cares."

18
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Oh, see you at the polls.

19
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Certainly.

20
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
I'll give her your best wishes,

21
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Mr. Nelson. Nelson

22
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Hi, this is Mike Johnson.

23
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs. Burns?

24
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Thank you.

25
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
We have done so much

26
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
in such a short amount of time.

27
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
I can't believe it!

28
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Wait till Philip comes home and sees our progress.

29
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Everyone saw the story in the Riverdale newspaper.

30
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Mr. Maxwell was very kind

31
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
to print my announcement.

32
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
It helps enormously.

33
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Everybody in Riverdale reads his paper.

34
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Your photo in it helped, too.

35
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Thanks to you, Richard,

36
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
it's a good picture.

37
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Well, hi, all.

38
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Hi, Dad.

39
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Hello, darling.

40
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
May I... may I help?

41
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Licking envelopes.

42
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I fold the fliers.

43
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
We stuff them.

44
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,600
And I lick the envelopes.

45
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Hey, everybody,

46
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Mrs. Greenberg is on the phone.

47
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
She says Carter Boswell is on the TV right now -

48
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
doing a commercial.

49
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
What channel?

50
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Five.

51
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,600
And if you ask what I care about, I'll tell you.

52
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,600
I care about the school buildings in need of paint.

53
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
I care about more lockers for the teachers.

54
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,600
I care about new fixtures in the hallways,

55
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
not music or dancing or entertainment.

56
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,600
I care about the practical things.

57
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,600
If you do, vote for me, Carter Boswell.

58
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,600
A lot of people will agree with him.

59
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,600
I told you.

60
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Too bad kids can't vote.

61
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
It's our school, but we can't vote.

62
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,600
There are people in favor of the cultural programs, Mom.

63
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
There are, Ellen.

64
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Don't be upset by Boswell's commercial.

65
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,600
You have to go on television, too.

66
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Boswell's a powerful speaker.

67
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,600
You can be, too.

68
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Your ideas are good ones.

69
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,600
I don't know.

70
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,600
I'm not sure I'm up to it.
