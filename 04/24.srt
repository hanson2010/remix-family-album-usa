1
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,100
It hurts, doesn't it?

2
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,100
You'll feel better tomorrow, Betty, believe me.

3
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,100
Only one day, and it won't hurt as much.

4
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,100
Do you feel like eating?

5
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
Having some dinner?

6
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,100
Oh, don't look so sad.

7
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
Let me tell you about your dinner.

8
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
It's ice cream.

9
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,100
Ice cream.

10
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,100
All kinds of flavors.

11
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
Chocolate.

12
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,100
Strawberry?

13
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,100
Vanilla?

14
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Vanilla, too?

15
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,100
I see you're feeling better already, Betty.

16
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,100
So you will have dinner?

17
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,100
OK, honey, we'll see to it

18
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,100
that you have strawberry and vanilla ice cream.

19
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Just rest now.

20
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
You need some rest to help you get better quickly.

21
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:28,100
Hi, Frank.

22
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,100
How you doing?

23
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,100
Oh, come on now.

24
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
You're a big boy.

25
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
It doesn't hurt that much, does it?

26
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,100
Oh, I'm sorry it hurts so much,

27
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,100
and you won't be able to have dinner.

28
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100
You're just going to have to have ice cream.

29
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,100
Yes, ice cream.

30
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Lots of flavors.

31
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,100
Want to hear them?

32
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Chocolate?

33
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,100
Then chocolate it is.

34
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
One scoop or two?

35
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Three scoops?

36
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
Then three it will be.

37
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:13,100
You want three scoops also?

38
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,100
Chocolate, too?

39
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,100
Well, I see you're feeling better.

40
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:22,100
Well, at least you're acting like you feel better.

41
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,100
Three scoops of chocolate ice cream for Tim coming up.

42
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:34,100
Hi, Carl.

43
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,100
How you doing?

44
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,100
I know it hurts.

45
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,100
But it'll be better tomorrow.

46
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
In the meantime, what would you like?

47
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Surprise.

48
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
A surprise?

49
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,100
I promised you a surprise, didn't I?

50
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,100
And it wasn't just ice cream, was it?

51
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,100
Your birthday is tomorrow, isn't it?

52
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Well, maybe, just maybe,

53
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
there will be a surprise.

54
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,100
But first you have to smile.

55
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,100
I just want to see one smile from you.

56
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,100
No smile, no surprise.

57
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,100
That's the deal.

58
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,100
No smile, no surprise.

59
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,100
If you want a surprise,

60
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
then you've got to smile first.

61
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:46,100
How are you all doing?

62
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
Well, I'm glad you're feeling better

63
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,100
because we have a little surprise for you today.

64
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
It's Carl's birthday,

65
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,100
and we have Popo the Clown to entertain you.

66
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,100
And here he is--Popo the Clown.

67
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Happy birthday, Carl.
Happy birthday.

68
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
All right, everybody.

69
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
OK, Carl.

70
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,100
It's your birthday.

71
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,100
What 's your wish?

72
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,100
What would you like?

73
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
Hmm?

74
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,100
You want to play charades?
