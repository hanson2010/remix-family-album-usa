1
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

2
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
No, it's not taken.

3
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Oh, thank you.

4
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Oh, let me help you with this.

5
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Oh, thank you.

6
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Do you want to sit by the window?

7
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
No, no, no. I like the aisle seat better.

8
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Please, you sit by the window.

9
00:07:51,600 --> 00:08:00,600
My name is Stewart... Malcolm Stewart.

10
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Pleased to meet you.

11
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
I'm Elsa Tobin. How do you do?

12
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Do you live in New York?

13
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
No, no. I'm from Florida.

14
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,600
I am, too. But didn't you just get on?

15
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,600
No, no. I just changed my seat.

16
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
A man next to me was smoking,

17
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,600
and smoke really bothers me.

18
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Where are you from in Florida?

19
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Titusville. It's near Orlando.

20
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Small world. I'm from Titusville, too.

21
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Really? What part?

22
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
My husband and I live near Spaceport.

23
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
I know that area.

24
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,600
My house is only a few miles from Spaceport.

25
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Do you still live there?

26
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Oh yes, yes. My husband's there now.

27
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,600
He couldn't take time off to come to New York with me.

28
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Do you still live there?

29
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,600
No. I sold the house and the furniture,

30
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,600
put a few personal things in an old trunk,

31
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,600
and shipped it to my children in New York.

32
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
That's my destination.

33
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Are you married?

34
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,600
My wife died four years ago.

35
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,600
She was a wonderful woman. A real friend.

36
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,600
I'm sorry. Really, I'm sorry.

37
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Lots of wonderful memories.

38
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,600
We were married almost fifty years.

39
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Well, forty-seven, to be exact.

40
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,600
John and I celebrate our fortieth anniversary next month.

41
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Oh, congratulations! That's nice.

42
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,600
What does John do?

43
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
He's an aerospace engineer

44
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
and works for Orlando Aircraft Corporation.

45
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,600
He started with them almost forty years ago.

46
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
What do you do?

47
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,600
I just retired. Had my own company.

48
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,600
A construction company. Roads, bridges, big stuff.

49
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,600
But I just sold it and retired.

50
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Excuse me, ma'am. Ticket, please.

51
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Would you kindly hold these keys, please?

52
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,600
I have a ticket, I know.

53
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
I was in the smoking section.

54
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
It's OK, lady. Take your time.

55
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,600
I'm sure it's in your purse, Mrs. Tobin.

56
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Oh, here it is.

57
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,600
And here are your keys.

58
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Thank you.

59
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Do you have family in New York?

60
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,600
No, no. But I do have very close friends in New York City.

61
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,600
We like to go to the theater together.

62
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,600
You said you have family in New York.

63
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Yes, indeed.

64
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,600
A son and his wife and their three children -

65
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
my grandchildren.

66
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
You must be excited.

67
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,600
I can't wait, to see them!

68
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Are you going to live with them?

69
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Yes.

70
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Permanently?

71
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Well... they want me to,

72
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,600
but it's too early to know for sure.

73
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I'm pretty independent.

74
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,600
I tried to teach my kids the importance of independence,

75
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,600
but I'm not sure I want to be alone.

76
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Some people don't mind being alone. I do.

77
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I understand. But tell me.

78
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Why did you stop working?

79
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:07,600
I retired because... I wanted to be with my family.

80
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,600
I didn't want to be alone anymore!
