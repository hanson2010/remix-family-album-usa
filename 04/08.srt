1
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,100
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

2
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,100
No, it's not taken.

3
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Oh, thank you.

4
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Oh, let me help you with this.

5
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,100
Oh, thank you.

6
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Do you want to sit by the window?

7
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,100
No, no, no. I like the aisle seat better.

8
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Please, you sit by the window.

9
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:32,100
My name is Stewart... Malcolm Stewart.

10
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,100
Pleased to meet you.

11
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,100
I'm Elsa Tobin. How do you do?

12
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Do you live in New York?

13
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,100
No, no. I'm from Florida.

14
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,100
I am, too. But didn't you just get on?

15
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,100
No, no. I just changed my seat.

16
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,100
A man next to me was smoking,

17
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,100
and smoke really bothers me.

18
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,100
Where are you from in Florida?

19
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Titusville. It's near Orlando. Titusville

20
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,100
Small world. I'm from Titusville, too.

21
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,100
Really? What part?

22
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
My husband and I live near Spaceport.

23
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,100
I know that area.

24
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,100
My house is only a few miles from Spaceport.

25
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Do you still live there?

26
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
Oh yes, yes. My husband's there now.

27
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,100
He couldn't take time off to come to New York with me.

28
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Do you still live there?

29
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,100
No. I sold the house and the furniture,

30
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,100
put a few personal things in an old trunk,

31
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,100
and shipped it to my children in New York.

32
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
That's my destination.

33
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,100
Are you married?

34
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,100
My wife died four years ago.

35
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,100
She was a wonderful woman. A real friend.

36
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,100
I'm sorry. Really, I'm sorry.

37
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Lots of wonderful memories.

38
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,100
We were married almost fifty years.

39
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,100
Well, forty-seven, to be exact.

40
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,100
John and I celebrate our fortieth anniversary next month.

41
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Oh, congratulations! That's nice.

42
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,100
What does John do? John

43
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,100
He's an aerospace engineer

44
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,100
and works for Orlando Aircraft Corporation.

45
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:33,100
He started with them almost forty years ago.

46
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,100
What do you do?

47
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,100
I just retired. Had my own company.

48
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:46,100
A construction company. Roads, bridges, big stuff.

49
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,100
But I just sold it and retired.

50
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:57,100
Excuse me, ma'am. Ticket, please.

51
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Would you kindly hold these keys, please?

52
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,100
I have a ticket, I know.

53
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
I was in the smoking section.

54
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
It's OK, lady. Take your time.

55
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,100
I'm sure it's in your purse, Mrs. Tobin.

56
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,100
Oh, here it is.

57
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,100
And here are your keys.

58
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
Thank you.

59
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Do you have family in New York?

60
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,100
No, no. But I do have very close friends in New York City.

61
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,100
We like to go to the theater together.

62
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,100
You said you have family in New York.

63
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
Yes, indeed.

64
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,100
A son and his wife and their three children--

65
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,100
my grandchildren.

66
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,100
You must be excited.

67
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,100
I can't wait, to see them!

68
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,100
Are you going to live with them?

69
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,100
Yes.

70
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
Permanently?

71
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,100
Well... they want me to,

72
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,100
but it's too early to know for sure.

73
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,100
I'm pretty independent.

74
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,100
I tried to teach my kids the importance of independence,

75
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,100
but I'm not sure I want to be alone.

76
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Some people don't mind being alone. I do.

77
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,100
I understand. But tell me.

78
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
Why did you stop working?

79
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:39,100
I retired because... I wanted to be with my family.

80
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,100
I didn't want to be alone anymore!
