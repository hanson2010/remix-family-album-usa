1
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
A little further to the right, Tom.

2
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Is this OK?

3
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Good. What do you think, Richard?

4
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
I like it there.

5
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,600
It's the first thing people will see when they come in.

6
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
It sets the tone for the whole show.

7
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
The next thing they'll see is

8
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,600
this enlargement with the words Family Album, U.S.A.

9
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,600
I can't believe this is really happening!

10
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
You've earned it.

11
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Years of work went into these pictures.

12
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,600
I know, but it's still a dream come true.

13
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Well, remember,

14
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
we're not sure

15
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
what the critics are going to write about your show yet.

16
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
And you never know

17
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,600
what the man from the New York Times is going to say about it.

18
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Are you worried?

19
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
I always worry.

20
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
The reviews of this show

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
are important for the sales of your book.

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
When do we see the reviews?

23
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Soon.

24
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
One of the critics is coming over this morning for a preview.

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I hope he's in a good mood.

26
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
So do I.

27
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Marilyn and I hope to use money from the sales of this book

28
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
to buy a new house.

29
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
The book will be a success.

30
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
And the show will help promote it.

31
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Speaking of promoting the book,

32
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
do I really have to

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
autograph copies for the guests at the opening?

34
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
It's common practice.

35
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,600
I feel uncomfortable about it.

36
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
A lot of people come to openings

37
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
just so they can get

38
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,600
the autograph of somebody who may be famous someday.

39
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Couldn't we wait until I'm famous?

40
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
That might be sooner than you think.

41
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
This one over here, Mr. Carlson?

42
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,600
A little further back, Tom.

43
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
It's too close to the refreshments.

44
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
No, I think this one belongs in the "people-at-work" section.

45
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,600
You may be right.

46
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Try it there, Tom.

47
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Right.

48
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Nervous about the opening tonight?

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Nervous?

50
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,600
No. I'm scared to death.

51
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
How about guests?

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
How many people will you be bringing?

53
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Well, my family, I guess.

54
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
My wife Marilyn, my father and mother,

55
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
my brother Robbie,

56
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
my sister and her husband and their daughter.

57
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
And my grandfather.

58
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Is that too many?

59
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
No such thing as "too many" at an opening.

60
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
I hope they like it.

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Your family or the public?

62
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Everybody.

63
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
But especially my family.

64
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
They've stood by me through all this.

65
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
I'm sure they'll like it.

66
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Harvey, how are you?

67
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Mitchell, so nice of you to come.

68
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Richard, this is Mitchell Johnson.

69
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Mitchell is

70
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
one of the most important syndicated reviewers in the country.

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Well, you're the young man who did all this.

72
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
I'm afraid so.

73
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Nice to meet you.

74
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Nice to meet you, Mr. Johnson.

75
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Mitchell has always encouraged new talent.

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Well ... you mind if I look around

77
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
and see what it says to me?

78
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Be our guest.

79
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Mm-hmm, hmm, uh-huh.

80
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:35,600
What does that mean when he goes,

81
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm"?

82
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
It probably means he's clearing his throat.

83
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
I don't know.

84
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
I don't care what the critics say, Mr. Stewart.

85
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Your work is brilliant.

86
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Thank you, Tom.

87
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Tom is studying photography at NYU. Tom

88
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,600
He's working with me during the summer months as an intern.

89
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Oh, really?

90
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
I'd like to see your work.

91
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
It's not good enough to show.

92
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
I'm still learning.

93
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Oh, I'd still like to see your work.

94
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
You may be the next Ansel Adams and not even know it.

95
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
If you really mean it,

96
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
I'll bring some of my pictures into the gallery.

97
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
I do mean it.

98
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Very interesting pictures, Mr. Stewart.

99
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
You have a most unusual eye.

100
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Thank you.

101
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
I hope that's a compliment.

102
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
It is.

103
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Are you going to be reviewing the show, Mitchell?

104
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Oh, yes. It's definitely worth reviewing.

105
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Favorably?

106
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Oh, you know I never answer that question, Harvey.

107
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
I'd like an advance copy of the book, though,

108
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
so I can study it.

109
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,600
I have an autographed one in my office.

110
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Tom, would you give Mr. Johnson

111
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
the copy of Richard's book on my desk?

112
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Just follow me, Mr. Johnson.

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Sure.

114
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Do you think he liked my photographs?

115
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
We'll know when tonight's papers come out.

116
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Keep your fingers crossed.
