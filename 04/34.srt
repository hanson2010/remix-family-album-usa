1
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Is that you, Susan?

2
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,600
It's me, Grandpa.

3
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Am I glad to see you!

4
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
And am I glad to see you!

5
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
I am also glad to be here.

6
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
How are things?

7
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I have been talking to a group of salesmen

8
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
since ten this morning,

9
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
and I'm real exhausted.

10
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Well, you look good.

11
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
What's Harry doing tonight?

12
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
He and Michelle

13
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
are visiting relatives in New Jersey today.

14
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
The rest of our family went to the movies.

15
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,600
So it's just you and me, Susan.

16
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
It's nice to be alone with you, Grandpa.

17
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
We don't get to see enough of each other.

18
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Oh, I feel the same way, Susan.

19
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
I miss seeing you.

20
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
But to tell the truth,

21
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
next time

22
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
I'd like to go into the city and meet you there,

23
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
instead of you coming here.

24
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
You don't need to do that, Grandpa.

25
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Yeah, I do.

26
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
I need to get out more.

27
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Well, I mean

28
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,600
there's a lot to do around the house,

29
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
and I love being here with the family,

30
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
you know,

31
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
but I'm restless.

32
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Since I retired,

33
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
I've got extra time on my hands.

34
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
I understand, Grandpa.

35
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
I think you do.

36
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Frankly,

37
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
I'd like to use my brain a little more.

38
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Grandpa,

39
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,600
you have so much energy and so many years of experience.

40
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,600
There are probably a lot of places for you to work

41
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Particularly in the construction field.

42
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
But at my age,

43
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
I'm not looking for a full-time job.

44
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
I'm retired.

45
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
But I'm bored.

46
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Well, there must be something.

47
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Maybe I can help.

48
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Let's go into the kitchen,

49
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,600
and maybe you can help me set the table.

50
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Sounds good to me.

51
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
What are we having?

52
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
I prepared lamb chops,

53
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,600
mashed potatoes, and a tossed green salad to begin with.

54
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Grandpa, you are a terrific guy!

55
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:05,600
You're still thinking about something to do, aren't you?

56
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
A job of some kind.

57
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
That's right.

58
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,600
I've been thinking about it for weeks now.

59
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
There must be some way to put my mind to good use.

60
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,600
We'll find a solution.

61
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
A positive solution

62
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,600
to your finding a way to use that wonderful mind of yours.
