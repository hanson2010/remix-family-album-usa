1
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,100
What happened?

2
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,100
The baby-sitter called.

3
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,100
His daughter is sick.

4
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
What's wrong?

5
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
I think she has a stomachache.

6
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,100
He's a good father.

7
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:43,100
So... what do you think of him?

8
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,100
He's very nice.

9
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,100
But I think he was nervous tonight.

10
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,100
It was his first date in two years.

11
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,100
Will you see him again?

12
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,100
I hope so.

13
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,100
This food is delicious.

14
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,100
He didn't get a thing to eat.

15
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,100
You ordered enough for three or four people,

16
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
but I'm not complaining.

17
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
The food is delicious.

18
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,100
Who is that?

19
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Do you think it's...

20
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:29,100
No. You won't believe it, Marilyn!

21
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,100
I believe it. Even without looking.

22
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Hi!

23
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
How...?

24
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Your downstairs neighbor let me in.

25
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Did you go home?

26
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,100
I did , but everything is OK,

27
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
so I decided to come back.

28
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,100
To apologize for leaving so early,

29
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
I brought you a little gift.

30
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,100
It's a bonsai tree

31
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,100
Hi, Marilyn. I hope it's not too late.

32
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Oh, not at all. We're still eating.

33
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,100
Please, come in. Join us.

34
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
It's our meal from the restaurant.

35
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,100
And how is your daughter?

36
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Oh, she's fine.

37
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,100
It's good that you went back.

38
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,100
Yes, I think it's important for me to be there

39
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
since her mother died.

40
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,100
I agree. Aren't you hungry?

41
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,100
As a matter of fact... I am hungry.

42
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
There's lots of food left.

43
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,100
Mmm, this is delicious!

44
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Enjoy!

45
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,100
I'm going to excuse myself.

46
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,100
I have a lot of work to do to get ready for tomorrow.

47
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,100
Good night, Harry. It was nice meeting you. Harry

48
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,100
Bye, Marilyn.

49
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Good night, Susan.

50
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Good night, Marilyn.

51
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,100
She's going to a fashion show here in the city tomorrow.

52
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
She is sleeping here

53
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,100
so she won't have to travel from Riverdale in the morning.

54
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
You two must be close.

55
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,100
we are.

56
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,100
The whole Stewart family is close. Stewart

57
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,100
I like that.

58
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:13,100
And then, two years ago, my wife died.

59
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
You miss her.

60
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:20,100
I do...yes, but I have Michelle...

61
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,100
and with time...

62
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,100
Is there anyone else in your life?

63
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,100
No, not yet. What about you?

64
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,100
Oh, I date occasionally,

65
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,100
but my work keeps me busy.

66
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Ooh, speaking of keeping busy-

67
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,100
I have an early start tomorrow,

68
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
and the baby-sitter has to get home.

69
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,100
Where did the time go?

70
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
It's midnight.

71
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:54,100
Thank you, Susan.

72
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
I had a nice evening.

73
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:08,100
Me, too, Harry. Harry?

74
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Yes?

75
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,100
I'd like to meet your daughter someday.

76
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,100
Does that mean that I can see you again?

77
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
Of course.

78
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Wonderful. I'll call you,

79
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,100
and we'll go out to dinner.

80
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,100
Please do.

81
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,100
I promise I won't leave early.

82
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,100
It was for a good reason.

83
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
You know something?

84
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,100
What?

85
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,100
I think we're going to be good friends.

86
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,100
Good night, Susan.

87
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,100
Good night, Harry,

88
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,100
Have a safe trip home.

89
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:47,100
Are you all right?

90
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,100
Sorry.

91
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:55,100
I never liked that umbrella stand.

92
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,100
Good night, Harry.
