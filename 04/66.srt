1
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Hi, big guy.

2
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
That must be Rita Mae.

3
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
She sure got here quickly.

4
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
That's a good sign.

5
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
She must like you and your work, Marilyn.

6
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
I think she's just anxious to see Max.

7
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
She loves children.

8
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Hi, Marilyn.

9
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Welcome.

10
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
It's so nice of you to come.

11
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Oh, I just wanted to see your baby, Max.

12
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Hello, Rita Mae.

13
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
I haven't seen you since the hospital.

14
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,600
I'm Ellen Stewart, Marilyn's mother-in-law.

15
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
We met at the hospital.

16
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
How are you?

17
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
How are you?

18
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Oh, and there is Max!

19
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Oh! My, how he's grown!

20
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,600
A little present for Max.

21
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Oh, it's beautiful, Rita Mae!

22
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
You shouldn't have.

23
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
It's nothing.

24
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
It's just a little present for Max.

25
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Can I get you some coffee or tea or a cold drink, Rita Mae?

26
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Oh, nothing, thank you.

27
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Well, I will leave you two to talk.

28
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Come on, you big guy.

29
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Yes, come on.

30
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
That's it.

31
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
It's nice seeing you.

32
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Let me know if you need anything.

33
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Thanks, Ellen.

34
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Thanks, Ellen.

35
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,600
OK, Marilyn.

36
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
You sounded like you've made a decision

37
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
when you called me.

38
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,600
I have made a decision, Rita Mae.

39
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
I've decided to stay at home and be a full-time mother.

40
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,600
I'm disappointed, but I respect your decision.

41
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,600
If I had a child as cute as Max,

42
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
I might do the same thing.

43
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
But I haven't finished telling you

44
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
the other half of my decision.

45
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
The other half?

46
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Yes.

47
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
I think I can stay at home

48
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,600
and take care of Max and continue my career.

49
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Sounds interesting.

50
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Let me hear it.

51
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Do you remember

52
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
our talks about custom-designed dresses for the boutique?

53
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
I sure do.

54
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Why can't I design dresses for you here at home?

55
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,000
And make them here.

56
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,900
Have the fittings here, too.

57
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,000
And I could do the selling and the pricing at the boutique.

58
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,600
Exactly.

59
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Oh!

60
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
What kind of dresses would you design?

61
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,600
I've thought about that for some time.

62
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Yes?

63
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Wedding dresses.

64
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Wedding dresses?

65
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Brilliant idea!

66
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,600
There's a big market today in wedding dresses.

67
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
That's what I thought.

68
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
I like the idea very much.

69
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
And if it's successful,

70
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
we can expand to all kinds of dresses.

71
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
That's what I thought.

72
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
As a matter of fact,

73
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,600
I have a customer for your first wedding dress.

74
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
My niece is getting married,

75
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,600
and I've been trying to find just the right thing for her.

76
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Marilyn, you're going to design my niece's dress. Marilyn

77
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
That'll be our first one,

78
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
and then we'll use it to sell others.

79
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Do you really mean it?

80
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
I really mean it.

81
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
It's a simple idea, and it will work.

82
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,600
You can certainly design dresses.

83
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
I know that.

84
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,600
And there's no reason why you can't do it from your home.

85
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
I'm so excited!

86
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
I can't wait to tell Richard!

87
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,600
If I had a baby like Max,

88
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,600
I'd want to stay home and be near him all the time, too.

89
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,600
You're making the right decision

90
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
for Max and for yourself too, Marilyn.

91
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
It all sounds so easy.

92
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Now the hard work begins.

93
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Would you like

94
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,600
to see some of my designs that I've been working on?

95
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
I'd love to.

96
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:28,600
Ooh! Oh, that's wonderful!

97
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Ooh...
