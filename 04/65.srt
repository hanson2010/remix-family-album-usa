1
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,600
There's your teddy bear, Max.

2
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,600
He just loves that teddy bear

3
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
that Grandpa Philip bought for him.

4
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I took him to Philip's office yesterday for a checkup.

5
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,600
You should have seen the look on his face

6
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,600
when Molly gave him the injection. Molly

7
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Oh, did he cry?

8
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
No.

9
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,600
My dear little boy just looked up at me as if to say,

10
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,600
"Mama, what are they doing to me? Help!"

11
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
How did you feel?

12
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Tell the truth.

13
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Didn't you feel terrible?

14
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
I sure did.

15
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,600
I held him closely.

16
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,600
I kissed the top of his dear little head.

17
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,600
He looked up at me.

18
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
He tried to smile.

19
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Being with him helped.

20
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Helped him?

21
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Or helped you?

22
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Being a mother is not easy,

23
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
if that's what you mean.

24
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Speaking of being a mother,

25
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,600
I've been meaning to ask you

26
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,600
what you were thinking about regarding going back to work.

27
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,600
I know Rita Mae called.

28
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
I can imagine what is going through your head.

29
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
I'm sure you can, Ellen.

30
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
There are so many things to consider.

31
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,600
One thing that makes it easier for you

32
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
is that you have us.

33
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Max will always have a family member to watch over him

34
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
while you're at work.

35
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,600
I didn't have that when Richard and Susan were born.

36
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
What did you do?

37
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,600
I chose to continue with my career as a music teacher.

38
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,600
We hired a woman to watch Richard and then Susan,

39
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,600
and I continued with my career.

40
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Do you think you made the right decision?

41
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I think I did.

42
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
But when Robbie was born,

43
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
I decided to give full-time attention to raising Robbie.

44
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
I felt differently at that time.

45
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
And you gave up your career as a music teacher?

46
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Not exactly.

47
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,600
I continued to teach piano lessons at home.

48
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,600
How did you feel about being away

49
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,600
when Susan and Richard were babies?

50
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,600
I think I did the right thing

51
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,600
for them and for myself and for Philip.

52
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
We needed the money.

53
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Well, we do too, Ellen.

54
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Everything I earn helps us towards getting that house

55
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
we want and need.

56
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,600
I can't wait till he's just a little older.

57
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Our toy company makes the most wonderful toys for kids.

58
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Max thanks you.

59
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
I thank you.

60
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
And Richard thanks you.

61
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Now may I please say hello?

62
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Hello.

63
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Hello.

64
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,600
I miss Max and think about him all week long.

65
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,600
We talk about him at dinnertime.

66
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Will you please try to relax?

67
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
I've never seen you so wound up.

68
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,600
You seem to be enjoying the pressure.

69
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
The truth is, I am.

70
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
My job is not an easy one,

71
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
but I really enjoy it.

72
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,600
That is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, Susan.

73
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
What's the problem?

74
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Marilyn's career.

75
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Well, my choice of careers.

76
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Choice?

77
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,600
My career as a fashion designer

78
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
versus my career as a mother.

79
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Why does it have to be one or the other?

80
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
That's what I said.

81
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
How's that?

82
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Why can't you do both?

83
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
She's right.

84
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Both?

85
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Well, that's what I do.

86
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,600
I have a job, and I have Michelle.

87
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
I take care of both to the best of my ability.

88
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,600
It's not easy, but what is?

89
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
And that's what I did.

90
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
I did both with Richard and Susan,

91
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
and I did both with Robbie.

92
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I thought you stayed home with Robbie?

93
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
I did.

94
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
But I was lucky enough to have a career as a music teacher

95
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
which I could continue at home.

96
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Why can't you work at home, Marilyn?

97
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
You're very talented.

98
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Designing dresses is a career

99
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
you could establish out of your home,

100
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
couldn't you?

101
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,600
I don't know why I didn't think of it.

102
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
It seems so simple now.

103
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
For a year or two

104
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,600
I could stay at home with Max and do my dress designs.

105
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,600
And you could make your dresses at home.

106
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Sounds like a great way to solve the problem.

107
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,600
That could solve your problem, Marilyn.

108
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,600
I'm going to call Rita Mae at home

109
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
and ask her to come by and talk about it.

110
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,600
She wants to see Max, anyway.

111
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,600
I think that really answers your questions, Marilyn.

112
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
You can do it.

113
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Do your designs at home - here.

114
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,600
And let Rita Mae do the selling at the boutique.

115
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,600
And you can both benefit financially.

116
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
I'm going to call Rita Mae right now.

117
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Oh, Susan, thank you so much

118
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,600
for coming all this way from the city to talk to me about it.

119
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I hope you don't mind

120
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
having taken so much time away from your busy schedule.

121
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Are you kidding?

122
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
I don't mind at all.

123
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
As a matter of fact,

124
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,600
I came to spend some time with my favorite nephew.

125
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
I think you should call Rita Mae right now.

126
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I think your idea of working at home is perfect.

127
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
I don't know what I would do without you.

128
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,600
I'm lucky to have you all.

129
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,600
We are lucky to have you, Marilyn.

130
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
And so is Max.
