1
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,600
I love my school. I have so many good friends there now.

2
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
I wouldn't miss a day even if I were really sick.

3
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Come and sit down for a minute, Michelle.

4
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,600
I'd like to talk to you about something.

5
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Something important.

6
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
What's wrong, Susan?

7
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Oh, there's nothing wrong, Michelle.

8
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
But your daddy and I are talking about something

9
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
that I'd like your opinion about.

10
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,600
I know. I heard you talking about it

11
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
the other night when I was trying on my new clothes.

12
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,600
It's about moving to Los Angeles.

13
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,600
You're right. How do you feel about it?

14
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Well, I really wouldn't want to move, but...

15
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
But?

16
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,600
But if you and Daddy wanted to,

17
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,600
I guess you know what's best for the family and for me.

18
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
That's very considerate of you, Michelle.

19
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
But what about your friends?

20
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
I'd miss them a lot,

21
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,600
but I know what it feels like to miss someone.

22
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Honey, we don't have to move

23
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
if you're not going to be happy about it.

24
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Does Daddy want to move?

25
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,600
I think so. He's going to tell us tonight about the job offer.

26
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Well, how was everybody's day today?

27
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Michelle was chosen to do Michelle

28
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
the school poster for the play this year.

29
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Congratulations, Michelle! That's something!

30
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,600
And how was your day, Susan?

31
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
I see you're in a good mood.

32
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Why don't you tell us about your day.

33
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,600
I met with Bill York.

34
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
It's OK to talk about it, Harry.

35
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Michelle knows all about it. Michelle

36
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Really?

37
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Really, Harry.

38
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Michelle and I have all kinds of feelings

39
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,600
about leaving New York, the family, and friends.

40
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,600
But if you think you should take the job, we're behind you.

41
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
What about Michelle's school?

42
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,600
We'll move after the school term.

43
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
What about her new friends?

44
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,600
I'll make new friends wherever we are as long as we're together.

45
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,600
We're a family, Harry.

46
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Whatever you think is right for you is right for us.

47
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:02,600
I am so touched. The two of you are really something.

48
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
We love you, Daddy.

49
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
And I love you.

50
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,600
OK. Now, tell us about your talk with Mr. York.

51
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Did you take the job?

52
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Nope.

53
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
What?

54
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
No? You didn't take it?

55
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,600
No, I did not take the job.

56
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
But, Daddy, I thought ...

57
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Harry, you didn't turn it down because of me... Harry

58
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Or me?

59
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
No, no. I turned it down because of me.

60
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
How's that?

61
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Well, I began to think about you and about Michelle,

62
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
and then I asked myself,

63
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
do I really want to work for the biggest company in the country?

64
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
And?

65
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
And I don't.

66
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
I went into business for myself

67
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
because I like being my own boss.

68
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,600
I run my own company. I'm a big fish in a little pond.

69
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
I'm not really sure I want to be a little fish in a big pond.

70
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Oh, Daddy, does that mean we don't have to move?

71
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
That's right, sweetheart.

72
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Are you sure?

73
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
I couldn't be more sure, Susan.

74
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,600
I'm glad if you are, Harry.

75
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
And besides,

76
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
how could I live in Los Angeles

77
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,600
when all my favorite people live here?

78
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Your favorite people?

79
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Who's that?

80
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,600
The Stewart family, of course.
