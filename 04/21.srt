1
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,100
OK.

2
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,100
If you want to adopt an animal,

3
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,100
first we need to know some references.

4
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,100
References?

5
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
People we know?

6
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Friends, teachers....

7
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
We need to talk to some people about you.

8
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,100
We want to be sure that you're responsible

9
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
and that you can take good care of an animal.

10
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,100
Then you have to fill out this form

11
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,100
about your family background.

12
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,100
Is that it?

13
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
No, there's more.

14
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,100
We need to know about your history with animals.

15
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
Have you ever owned an animal?

16
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Yes.

17
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,100
We had a cat when I was eight years old.

18
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,100
I love cats.

19
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
Do you have any animals now?

20
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
Unfortunately, no.

21
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
Anything else?

22
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
We also like to know

23
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
your reasons for wanting an animal.

24
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,100
Just to hold it and cuddle with it.

25
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
Just to have as a pet.

26
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,100
I love animals.

27
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:06,100
To have a friend -- a pal.

28
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,100
You know, man's best friend is his dog.

29
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,100
And one thing more.

30
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
If you're under twenty-one years of age ...

31
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,100
That's me.

32
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
Then an adult must sign for you.

33
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Uh-oh.

34
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,100
No problem.

35
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
My parents will think it's a good idea.

36
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
I'll be back with them.

37
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
If the real owners don't come to claim Gemma ...

38
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
After forty-eight hours.

39
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
But please call first.

40
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Thanks for your information and for being so helpful.

41
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,100
It's my pleasure.

42
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Nice talking to both of you.

43
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Thanks again.

44
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Bye.

45
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,100
Maybe the real owners will come to claim her.

46
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
Her eyes look so sad.

47
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100
She must really miss them.

48
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
I see you're both animal lovers.

49
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,100
We are.

50
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,100
Good-bye, Miss Aborn.

51
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
We'll call in a couple of days.

52
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
Good-bye, and thanks for bringing Gemma in.

53
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Bye.

54
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:09,100
I keep thinking about the dog -- about Gemma,

55
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,100
alone in the animal shelter.

56
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
I know.

57
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
But I promise you, Alexandra,

58
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,100
the dog is just fine.

59
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,100
They're very kind to the animals.

60
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,100
I know they are.

61
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,100
I mean about her being alone.

62
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,100
Even if they are kind to Gemma,

63
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
she's still alone, without her family.

64
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,100
Ready, folks?

65
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,100
Are you ready, Alexandra?

66
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Yes, I'm ready.

67
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,100
I'll have the chef's salad, please.

68
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,100
I will have a cheeseburger, medium rare,

69
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,100
with raw onion, and french fries, please.

70
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Anything to drink?

71
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,100
A diet cola, please.

72
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Ginger ale with lots of ice for me, thank you.

73
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
I've got it.

74
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Thanks.

75
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Aren't you surprised

76
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,100
that the animal shelter is so careful

77
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,100
about finding homes for the animals?

78
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,100
No, I'm not.

79
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,100
And a cheeseburger, medium rare,

80
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,100
with onion and french fries.

81
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
And a ginger ale with lots of ice.

82
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Salad dressing?

83
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Hey, I wanted you to hear my new sound system

84
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
when the dog scratched on the front door.

85
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,100
and then we'll go back to my house.

86
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
I want you to hear my new tapes.

87
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
I've got some great new dance music.

88
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Hello.

89
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,100
Stewart residence. Stewart

90
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Hello.

91
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
Is Robbie Stewart there? Robbie Stewart

92
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,100
This is he.

93
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
Who's this?

94
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,100
This is Linda Aborn from the animal shelter.

95
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,100
It's Linda from the animal shelter.

96
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,100
Yes, Linda.

97
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Hi.

98
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,100
We have good news and bad news, Robbie.

99
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,100
Oh?

100
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
The good news is that the Levinsons have come by

101
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,100
to pick up the dog.

102
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,100
The bad news is, you won't be able to adopt the dog.

103
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,100
That's OK.

104
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,100
Come by one day and look at some of the other dogs.

105
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,100
I'm sure there's one for you.

106
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Thanks, Robbie.

107
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,100
And the Levinsons thank you for bringing their dog to us. Levinson

108
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,100
Thanks, Linda.

109
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,100
Bye.

110
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:25,100
The owners claimed Gemma?

111
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,100
That's right.

112
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
I'm glad for the dog.

113
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,100
I guess I am, too.

114
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,100
She said if I come by,

115
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,100
she'll help me find another dog.

116
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,100
Come on.

117
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Let's dance.
