1
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,600
OK.

2
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
If you want to adopt an animal,

3
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
first we need to know some references.

4
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
References?

5
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
People we know?

6
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Friends, teachers...

7
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
We need to talk to some people about you.

8
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,600
We want to be sure that you're responsible

9
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
and that you can take good care of an animal.

10
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Then you have to fill out this form

11
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
about your family background.

12
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Is that it?

13
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
No, there's more.

14
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,600
We need to know about your history with animals.

15
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Have you ever owned an animal?

16
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Yes.

17
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,600
We had a cat when I was eight years old.

18
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
I love cats.

19
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Do you have any animals now?

20
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Unfortunately, no.

21
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Anything else?

22
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
We also like to know

23
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
your reasons for wanting an animal.

24
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Just to hold it and cuddle with it.

25
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Just to have as a pet.

26
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
I love animals.

27
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,600
To have a friend - a pal.

28
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,600
You know, man's best friend is his dog.

29
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,600
And one thing more.

30
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
If you're under 21 years of age...

31
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
That's me.

32
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Then an adult must sign for you.

33
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Uh-oh.

34
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
No problem.

35
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
My parents will think it's a good idea.

36
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
I'll be back with them.

37
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
If the real owners don't come to claim Gemma...

38
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
After forty-eight hours.

39
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
But please call first.

40
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Thanks for your information and for being so helpful.

41
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
It's my pleasure.

42
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,600
Nice talking to both of you.

43
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Thanks again.

44
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Bye.

45
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Maybe the real owners will come to claim her.

46
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,600
Her eyes look so sad.

47
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
She must really miss them.

48
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
I see you're both animal lovers.

49
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
We are.

50
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Good-bye, Miss Aborn.

51
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
We'll call in a couple of days.

52
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Good-bye, and thanks for bringing Gemma in.

53
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Bye.

54
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:55,600
I keep thinking about the dog, about Gemma,

55
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
alone in the animal shelter.

56
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
I know.

57
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
But I promise you, Alexandra,

58
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
the dog is just fine.

59
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
They're very kind to the animals.

60
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
I know they are.

61
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
I mean about her being alone.

62
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Even if they are kind to Gemma,

63
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
she's still alone, without her family.

64
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Ready, folks?

65
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Are you ready, Alexandra?

66
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Yes, I'm ready.

67
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
I'll have the chef's salad, please.

68
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,600
I will have a cheeseburger, medium rare,

69
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,600
with raw onion, and french fries, please.

70
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Anything to drink?

71
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
A diet cola, please.

72
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,600
Ginger ale with lots of ice for me, thank you.

73
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
I've got it.

74
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Thanks.

75
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Aren't you surprised

76
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
that the animal shelter is so careful

77
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
about finding homes for the animals?

78
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
No, I'm not.

79
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
And a cheeseburger, medium rare,

80
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
with onion and french fries.

81
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
And a ginger ale with lots of ice.

82
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Salad dressing?

83
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Hey, I wanted you to hear my new sound system

84
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
when the dog scratched on the front door.

85
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Let's finish eating,

86
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
and then we'll go back to my house.

87
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
I want you to hear my new tapes.

88
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
I've got some great new dance music.

89
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:23,600
(music... beep...)

90
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Hello.

91
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
Stewart residence.

92
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Hello.

93
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Is Robbie Stewart there?

94
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
This is he.

95
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Who's this?

96
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
This is Linda Aborn from the animal shelter.

97
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
It's Linda from the animal shelter.

98
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Yes, Linda.

99
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Hi.

100
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
We have good news and bad news, Robbie.

101
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Oh?

102
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
The good news is that the Levinsons have come by

103
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
to pick up the dog.

104
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,600
The bad news is, you won't be able to adopt the dog.

105
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
That's OK.

106
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Come by one day and look at some of the other dogs.

107
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
I'm sure there's one for you.

108
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Thanks, Robbie.

109
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,600
And the Levinsons thank you for bringing their dog to us.

110
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Thanks, Linda.

111
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Bye.

112
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:11,600
The owners claimed Gemma?

113
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
That's right.

114
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
I'm glad for the dog.

115
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
I guess I am, too.

116
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,600
She said if I come by,

117
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
she'll help me find another dog.

118
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Come on.

119
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
Let's dance.
