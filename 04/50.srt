1
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Good morning.

2
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Good morning. My name is Richard Stewart.

3
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
I'm here to see Mr. Carlson.

4
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Please sit down, Mr. Stewart.

5
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Mr. Carlson will be with you shortly.

6
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Thank you.

7
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Excuse me, Mr. Carlson,

8
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
but Richard Stewart is here

9
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
for his ten o'clock appointment with you.

10
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
OK. Thank you.

11
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Like I said, he'll be with you shortly.

12
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Thank you.

13
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Yes, Mr. Carlson. Yes, sir.

14
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,600
He's ready for you, Mr. Stewart.

15
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Thank you. In there?

16
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Yes. In there. Good luck.

17
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Come in, come in.

18
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,600
This is a crazy morning. Hello, Richard.

19
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Hello, Mr. Carlson.

20
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Sit down, sit down.

21
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.

22
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
I hope you've brought your pictures along.

23
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I see that you have. Let's get right to it.

24
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,600
We need a new coffee-table book,

25
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,600
and a book of photos about the United States still feels right.

26
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
OK, let's take a look.

27
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Good. Very good. Family Album, U.S.A.

28
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
It's an excellent title.

29
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,600
If you had to describe the book in one sentence,

30
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
how would you do it?

31
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Well, I'd describe it as a book which is a...

32
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,600
a portrait of the United States -

33
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,600
the places, the people, mostly the people.

34
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,600
The things they do, the ways they live,

35
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
the places they visit, and the landmarks.

36
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
A photographic journey.

37
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
These are wonderful.

38
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,600
These photos in your performing arts section.

39
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center.

40
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I'm glad you like them.

41
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,600
I do, but...

42
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
But?

43
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,600
There's something missing. You've got a good eye, Richard.

44
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
You're a terrific photographer.

45
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,600
But before I can publish your work,

46
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
I need to meet with my marketing department,

47
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
and you've got to do one more thing.

48
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,600
What's that, Mr. Carlson?

49
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
In the section on culture,

50
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
you've included performing arts centers,

51
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
but you've left out street performance.

52
00:11:52,600 --> 00:12:00,600
The mimes.

53
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Richard, if you go out

54
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
and photograph street performances in the city,

55
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
you'll have it.

56
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,600
That is a great idea.

57
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
The performing arts centers and the street performances.

58
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
I'll do it.

59
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
If you do it, I'll publish your work.

60
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Are you serious?

61
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
I've never been more serious.

62
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,600
When do you think you can return with street performances?

63
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
A couple of weeks.

64
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,600
If they're as good as the rest of these pictures, it's a deal.

65
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,600
You won't be disappointed, Mr. Carlson. Thanks.

66
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Good-bye, Richard, and good luck. See you in two weeks.

67
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Good-bye, Mr. Carlson. Thanks.

68
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:51,600
So if you like the street-performance photos,

69
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,600
you'll really publish Family Album, U.S.A.?

70
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,600
When I say something, I mean it.

71
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Go to work. Good-bye.

72
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Good-bye.
