1
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
What's this?

2
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Read it.

3
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,600
I can't.

4
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Would you read it, Marilyn?

5
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,600
"Richard Stewart's show at the Carlson Gallery"

6
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
is a collection of photographs

7
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
from his new book entitled "Family Album, U.S.A."

8
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,600
There is power and beauty in Mr. Stewart's work,

9
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
and his book

10
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
introduces us to a remarkable new talent.

11
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Oh, Richard, it's wonderful!

12
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Congratulations!

13
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Wow! I'm overwhelmed.

14
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

15
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,600
if I may have your attention for a moment, please?

16
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,600
I hope you're all enjoying the exhibition.

17
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
I know that I am.

18
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,600
And I would like to introduce the young man

19
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
who spent the last five years

20
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
taking these remarkable pictures

21
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,600
and writing the background for Family Album, U.S.A.

22
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Mr. Richard Stewart.

23
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Hello.

24
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I want to thank all of you for coming here tonight.

25
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,600
I'd like to thank Harvey Carlson

26
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
for his faith in my project.

27
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,600
But most of all,

28
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,600
I would like to thank my family

29
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,600
for their love and support all through this adventure.

30
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Thank you.

31
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Oh, I'm glad that's over.

32
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Would you mind?

33
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
Oh, not at all.

34
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Thanks.

35
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Our pleasure.

36
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
Hope it wins a Pulitzer Prize.

37
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
I'll settle for an "A" in my photography course.

38
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Ah, Richard, Marilyn, I want you to meet John O'Neill.

39
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Oh, how do you do?

40
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Nice to meet you.

41
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,600
I've been looking forward to meeting your husband, Mrs. Stewart.

42
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,600
I'm really impressed by your show.

43
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Thank you.

44
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
In fact, I'd like your autograph.

45
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Oh, well, really...

46
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
On a contract.

47
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,600
What's this about, Harvey?

48
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Mr. O'Neill is the publisher of several magazines.

49
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Of course. I've seen you on television.

50
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Mr. O'Neill was so impressed with your work

51
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
that he wants to develop it into a magazine concept.

52
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Well, that sounds very exciting,

53
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,600
but where would I fit into the plan?

54
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
I'd like you to be the photo editor of the magazine.

55
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Oh, Richard, how exciting!

56
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
It's a wonderful opportunity, Richard.

57
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Hold on. Wait a minute, please.

58
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,600
What's the problem, Richard?

59
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,600
The problem is that I'm a photographer, not an editor.

60
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
I like what I do.

61
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
In fact, I love what I do...

62
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,600
which is going out with a camera and a roll of film

63
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
and seeing the wonder of humanity.

64
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Now, I appreciate your offer,

65
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
but I've worked so hard on Family Album, U.S.A.,

66
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,600
and I'm giving some thought to a new book on a different subject.

67
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
I'm flattered,

68
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,600
but I enjoy taking pictures, and I want to continue doing that.

69
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Thank you,

70
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,600
but I'm happy being a photographer.

71
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
I understand, Richard.

72
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Richard, I know your next book will be a success.

73
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Congratulations!

74
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Thanks.

75
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:17,600
You're a real Stewart!

76
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Thanks.
