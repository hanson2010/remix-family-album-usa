1
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh, it's a quarter to four,

2
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,600
and I have a production meeting at four.

3
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,600
I planned to take you for a ride in Central Park

4
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
in a horse and carriage.

5
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Harry, I'd love to,

6
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
but I have work to do.

7
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,600
OK. We'll walk back to your office with you.

8
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
It's so nice out.

9
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,600
I decided to forget about my accounting problems

10
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,600
and just enjoy this beautiful spring day.

11
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Take the time, Susan.

12
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
I know I should,

13
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,600
but ... well, there are too many things to do.

14
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
I understand.

15
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
I'll go for a ride with Michelle.

16
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Right.

17
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Well, I had a really nice time.

18
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
So did I.

19
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
So did I.

20
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
I'm sorry you can't come with us, Susan.

21
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
So am I.

22
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Bye-bye.

23
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Harry! Michelle!

24
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Can you wait till I make a phone call?

25
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Sure.

26
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Susan Stewart's office.

27
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Sam, this is Susan. Sam

28
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Hi. How was lunch?

29
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Fine.

30
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
You're late.

31
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,600
The production department's waiting in the conference room.

32
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
I know.

33
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Ask Paul Smith to fill in for me.

34
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
He knows everything about the production schedule,

35
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
and he can answer any questions.

36
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Right.

37
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Don't tell any one,

38
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
but I'm taking a little time to smell the flowers.

39
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Good for you.

40
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
It'll be our secret.

41
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
But schedule another production meeting for tomorrow.

42
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
I'll be back

43
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
for my six o'clock appointment with Mr. Ozawa.

44
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
OK, Susan.

45
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
And have a nice afternoon.

46
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Thanks.

47
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
She likes you.

48
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
I know. I like her.

49
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
How'd you do it?

50
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
We had a talk.

51
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
About what?

52
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Life.

53
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
And what did you decide?

54
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,600
That's a secret... between us women.
