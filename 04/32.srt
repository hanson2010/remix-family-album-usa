1
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,600
I remember your parents' first house very well.

2
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,600
It was on Spring Avenue, near the park.

3
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
I grew up in that house.

4
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,000
Yes, and you were such a cute baby.

5
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I've seen pictures of him.

6
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He had blond hair.

7
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I've been friendly with the Stewart family

8
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
for a long time,

9
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
so it's my pleasure

10
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
to help you find a house now.

11
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Well, we're not sure we can afford one.

12
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
But we'd like to find out

13
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
about the possibilities.

14
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
That's a good idea.

15
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,600
I love your house on Linden Street.

16
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,600
I sold your father that house seventeen years ago.

17
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Really?

18
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Yes, Mom was pregnant with Robbie then,

19
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
and they needed the extra room.

20
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I hear you're expecting a baby, Mrs. Stewart.

21
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Mmm-hmm.

22
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
So we will be needing more room.

23
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Oh, so you don't need something immediately?

24
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,600
No. But in five or six months...

25
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
And time passes so quickly.

26
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Yes, it does.

27
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Well, when you called,

28
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
you gave me enough information

29
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
about your salaries and your savings.

30
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
So I have a good idea about your financial situation.

31
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Let me show you some pictures of houses.

32
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
With two bedrooms?

33
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Yes, I think I can show you some.

34
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Of course, they won't be in Riverdale.

35
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
The cost of housing's too high for you here.

36
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,600
I haven't thought about living anywhere else.

37
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,600
We've always lived in this area.

38
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Where should we look for a house, Mrs. Martinelli?

39
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Well, we have an office in Mount Kisco.

40
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
It's a lovely area,

41
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
and it's only about an hour's drive from here.

42
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Here.

43
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,600
I have a book with photos of some homes in that area.

44
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Now, let's see.

45
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Here

46
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,600
This is a lovely two-bedroom house in your price range.

47
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,600
It's pretty,

48
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
but I prefer a two-story home.

49
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
I do, too.

50
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
I don't care for a ranch type.

51
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
OK.

52
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Oh, this is a wonderful house.

53
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
I know it well.

54
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
I sold it to the present owners.

55
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
It looks wonderful.

56
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,600
This is a two-bedroom, two-bath house.

57
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
It has a full basement,

58
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
and it is on a half-acre lot.

59
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
You can probably afford this one.

60
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I like this house.

61
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
So do I.

62
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
And the price is right.

63
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Would you like to go see it?

64
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Yes. We're planning

65
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
to talk to someone at the bank next week.

66
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Perhaps we could see the house this weekend.

67
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,600
If someone doesn't buy it before then,

68
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,600
But let's keep looking.

69
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Just to get an idea of some other possibilities.

70
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
This is very helpful, Mrs. Martinelli.

71
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Here.

72
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,600
This is a wonderful example of Spanish-style architecture.

73
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,600
I love the roof tiles on a Spanish-style house.

74
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,600
It looks like the houses in Hollywood.

75
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
It's interesting.

76
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,600
A house like this in Riverdale costs double the price.

77
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Oh my!

78
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Here's a real buy.

79
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
It's a bargain.

80
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
This house just came on the market.

81
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
It's quite lovely.

82
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Is it a two-bedroom house?

83
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,600
No. It has three bedrooms and three baths.

84
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
I know the house.

85
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
It has a brand new kitchen.

86
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
And a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling.

87
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,600
And there's a two-car garage.

88
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Then why don't we go look at this house, too?

89
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
It's a good investment.

90
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Thank you, Mrs. Martinelli.

91
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Thanks so much.

92
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
My pleasure.

93
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Give my best to your parents.

94
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Your father's a wonderful doctor, Richard.

95
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
He took care of my daughter

96
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
when she was a child.

97
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
He's the best pediatrician in Westchester.

98
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Thanks, Mrs. Martinelli.

99
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
I'll give them your regards.

100
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
We really appreciate your advice.

101
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I do think you should go see the houses

102
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
and talk to the bank.

103
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Here.

104
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Let me give you some information sheets about the houses.

105
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,600
They're both very good buys.

106
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Well, thanks so much for your help and your time,

107
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Mrs. Martinelli.

108
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
We've got a lot to talk about.

109
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Mmm-hmm. Thanks.
