1
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,600
I'm so glad everyone is asleep.

2
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
I thought Max would be crying, and everybody would be awake.

3
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
What did I tell you?

4
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Nothing to worry about.

5
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
I'm sure everything is fine.

6
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
My mother knows all there is to know

7
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
about taking care of babies, I assure you.

8
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Let's put some of this stuff away and then take off.

9
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
We've got a forty-minute drive into the city.

10
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Welcome home,

11
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
and I do mean welcome home.

12
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Something wrong?

13
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Oh, nothing's wrong, Richard.

14
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Believe me, Max is fine.

15
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,600
But his teeth hurt, and he just can't get to sleep, poor dear.

16
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,600
Neither can you.

17
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Oh, I feel so bad.

18
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Oh, I'm fine.

19
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
How was your weekend?

20
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
We had a great time, Mom.

21
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
It was wonderful.

22
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
The weather couldn't have been better.

23
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,600
It was nice here, too.

24
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
Did you get a chance to get outside at all?

25
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Oh, yes.

26
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Grandpa helped me yesterday afternoon.

27
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
I went to the supermarket to get a few things,

28
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,600
and I stayed out an extra half hour.

29
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
The village was filled with people. The weather was so nice.

30
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Harry's a professional camper, Mom.

31
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
He knows all there is to know,

32
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
and he made the weekend very easy for us to enjoy.

33
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Come on. You all helped.

34
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
You were wonderful, Harry!

35
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Why don't you go to your room, Mom, and get some sleep.

36
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Oh, I'm fine.

37
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Tell me more about your weekend.

38
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Did you do anything special?

39
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Lots of special country things.

40
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
We picked flowers.

41
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
And we brought some home for you.

42
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,600
It was so nice to be out in the country.

43
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,600
They smell wonderful.

44
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Everything smelled so special.

45
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,600
It would have been great if we had been able to bottle the smells.

46
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
It would be a great business if you could do that.

47
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Oh!

48
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Uh, we're home now, Ellen.

49
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
We'll take care of it.

50
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
I'll take care of it.

51
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Let's see if it works.

52
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
What's that?

53
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,600
A little special country music.

54
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,600
I think we'd better head home.

55
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
It's getting late, and we have a bit of a drive.

56
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Well, all your things are inside.

57
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
There's your sleeping bag.

58
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Oh, thanks, Harry.

59
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Say good-bye to Richard.

60
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
We'll call you all tomorrow night.

61
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Good-bye.

62
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Bye, Mom.

63
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:30,600
I'm so tired I think I'm overtired.

64
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,600
I don't know if I can get to sleep.

65
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Max has stopped crying.

66
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Yes. It works!

67
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
It works!

68
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,600
What works?

69
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
This.

70
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Oh. Oh, where did you get that?

71
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,600
It sounds so nice.

72
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:21,600
I think I'm falling asleep.

73
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Like Max did.

74
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Good night.

75
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Sounds of the country.

76
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,600
The soothing sounds of the country.
