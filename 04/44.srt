1
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Right this way, Mr. and Mrs. Stewart.

2
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Well, it's small, but clean.

3
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Clean? You call this clean?

4
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Have a nice stay.

5
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Thank you. I don't believe this.

6
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Well, it isn't the Watermill Inn,

7
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,600
but let's get a look at the view.

8
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:38,600
How is the view?

9
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Great,

10
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,600
if you enjoy looking at a parking lot.

11
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Well, maybe we'll see the view in the morning.

12
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Right now, we should clean up this room.

13
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Sorry, Marilyn.

14
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Why should you be sorry?

15
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Well, the rain, the room, the view of the parking lot.

16
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,600
It isn't the way I hoped it would be.

17
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Stop blaming yourself.

18
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:29,600
After all, we're here, we're alone, we're together.

19
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,600
And I love you. Isn't that enough?

20
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
It is for me,

21
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
but I wanted this weekend to be special for you.

22
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:45,600
It is special. Happy anniversary.

23
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:53,600
It's still raining. I want to play tennis.

24
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,600
I want some breakfast.

25
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Let's call room service and order a nice breakfast,

26
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
and then we'll figure out what to do today.

27
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Right. Would you give me room service, please?

28
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:16,600
I beg your pardon? Oh, I see.

29
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:23,600
They don't have room service at Old Country Inn. Old Country Inn

30
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Well, let's go down to the coffee shop.

31
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,600
They don't have a coffee shop.

32
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,600
We can get our meals at Mrs. Montefiore's down the road.

33
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,600
That's OK, honey.

34
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
I love walking in the rain.

35
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Oh, you're being a really good sport about this, Marilyn,

36
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
but I think we should face the truth.

37
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
What's that?

38
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,600
This is not the way to spend our fifth anniversary.

39
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Well, what do you want to do?

40
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Why don't we get in the car and drive home?

41
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Oh, Richard, it really isn't that bad.

42
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Do you want to stick it out for the whole weekend?

43
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Well, I'll admit the room is uncomfortable.

44
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Uh-hum.

45
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
And I do feel bad about your mother

46
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
having to take care of the baby all weekend.

47
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Why don't we just check out?

48
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
OK.

49
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Hello? Yes. Yes, this is she.

50
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Oh, hello! How nice of you to remember us!

51
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Yes, my husband did call.

52
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:43,600
You do? Really? It won't be any trouble?

53
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Oh, yes, I think we'd like that very much.

54
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Fifteen minutes! Thank you. Good-bye.

55
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,600
You will never guess.

56
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Uh ... I give up.

57
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Mrs. Montefiore from the Watermill Inn.

58
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,600
What is she calling about?

59
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
They have an opening.

60
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Someone just checked out.

61
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,600
and Mrs. Montefiore has reserved the honeymoon suite for us.

62
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
You're kidding!

63
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
No. Isn't it wonderful?

64
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
It's fantastic!

65
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Oh. Now all it has to do is stop raining.

66
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Let's go.
