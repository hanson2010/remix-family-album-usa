1
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Ellen, I'd like your opinion.

2
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
About what?

3
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Well, Richard and I feel that with a baby coming

4
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,600
we need to have our own place to live.

5
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Oh.

6
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Well, what do you think about Richard and me

7
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
looking for a small house or an apartment

8
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
at this point in our lives?

9
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,600
We love having you here,

10
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
and there is room,

11
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
and ... and when the baby comes,

12
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
the baby can stay in your room for a while.

13
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Richard feels we need to find a small house.

14
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:54,600
I remember when I was pregnant with Richard.

15
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Philip and I were living with Grandma and Grandpa.

16
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Philip was a young doctor, Philip

17
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
and he kept talking about having a house of our own.

18
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,600
It's natural.

19
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
What did you do?

20
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,600
We looked at a lot of houses.

21
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Did you find one?

22
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Oh, not at first.

23
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
We couldn't afford it.

24
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Grandpa wanted to lend us the money to buy one,

25
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
but Philip is too independent.

26
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
He didn't want to borrow any money.

27
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Sounds like Richard.

28
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
They're all alike.

29
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Richard is a real Stewart.

30
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,600
He's independent,

31
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,600
and sometimes just stubborn.

32
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,600
When did you buy a house?

33
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
After Richard was born.

34
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
I was teaching music,

35
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,600
and Philip was opening his first medical office.

36
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Where was the house?

37
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Right here in Riverdale.

38
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Of course, it was a small house,

39
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
but just right for us.

40
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,600
It's funny. History repeats itself.

41
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Now Richard and I are having a baby,

42
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
and we probably won't be able to

43
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
afford a house right away, either.

44
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Why don't you look at some houses, Marilyn?

45
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Good idea.

46
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Look in the real-estate section of Sunday's Times.

47
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
You'll learn a lot.

48
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Maybe we should

49
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
speak to a real-estate agent about a house.

50
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
And a bank about a mortgage.

51
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
I'll talk to Richard about it.

52
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
I think it's a good idea, Ellen.

53
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
We can learn a lot by asking.

54
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
And if I can be of any help,

55
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
let me know.

56
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
As a matter of fact,

57
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
my friend Virginia Martinelli is a real-estate agent.

58
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Good.

59
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
You won't believe this,

60
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
but she sold us our first house and this one.

61
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Well, I'll tell Richard,

62
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
and we'll go to see her.

63
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Do you think the skirt length is right, Ellen?

64
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Do you think it's too long?

65
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,600
I think the skirt is just right.

66
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Are you planning to attach a train to it?

67
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
No. No train. Just the dress.

68
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,600
But I am going to make a headpiece of lace.

69
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,600
That dress is gorgeous.

70
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Thanks, Ellen.

71
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
And thanks for the advice about the house.

72
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
I'll talk to Richard about it

73
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
the minute he comes home.

74
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
And remember,

75
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,600
we love having you here.

76
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,600
There's no need to rush.
