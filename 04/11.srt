1
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,600
OK, Richard. That's terrific.

2
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Your pressure is 120 over 75, and that's fine.

3
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Now stand up, please.

4
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Good, it's 122 over 80.

5
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
You can sit down now.

6
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,600
When was your last complete physical?

7
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Six months ago.

8
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Good. Do you have any back or knee problems?

9
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Nope. I am in perfect health.

10
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
What do you do for a living, Mr. Stewart?

11
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
I'm a photographer.

12
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Interesting. What do you photograph?

13
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Everything. The American scene. People, places, events.

14
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Did you ever think of photographing an aerobics class?

15
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,600
No... I can't remember taking pictures of people exercising.

16
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,600
But don't you think it'd be a good subject?

17
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Sure.

18
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,600
I need some good photos for my advertising, Mr. Stewart.

19
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Maybe you can photogragh a class,

20
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
and I can give you and Mrs. Stewart

21
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
a month of classes ree.

22
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
When can I photograph a class?

23
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Anytime.

24
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
How about today?

25
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Terrific!

26
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Hi.

27
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Oh, hi.

28
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Oh, hi.

29
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Are we ready to go?

30
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Yeah. Yeah. Let's get in our lines.

31
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,600
We're going to take it slow first.

32
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Stretch up ... and we're going to go left first...

33
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:11,600
2, 3, 4... now switch.

34
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
OK, hold to the right.

35
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Sunrises. Stretch it out. Flat back.

36
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Bring it up... and twists... and side... 2, 3...

37
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:44,600
and left... push... push... turn... hit the floor.

38
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Take it side again... OK, and switch. Stretch it out.

39
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,600
And we're going to warm down with a tango.

40
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Left, right. Enjoy it.

41
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Richard, did you go to the Davis Aerobics class today?

42
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Yes, I went to the aerobics class today.

43
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
What is wrong with you?

44
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Nothing. I am in excellent health.

45
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,600
I have ideal blood pressure. A perfect heart.

46
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,600
In other words, I'm in wonderful condition.

47
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Richard, did you go to the aerobics class, really?

48
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
And don't forget to invite Susan for dinner.

49
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,600
And your legs don't hurt?

50
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Hurt? What do you mean?

51
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,600
What about your arms? Lift your arms up like this.

52
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,600
And they don't hurt not even a little?

53
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Nope.

54
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:13,600
You are in great condition. I can't believe it!
