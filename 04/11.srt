1
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,100
OK, Richard. That's terrific.

2
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Your pressure is 120 over 75, and that's fine.

3
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Now stand up, please.

4
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:35,100
Good, it's 122 over 80.

5
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,100
You can sit down now.

6
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,100
When was your last complete physical?

7
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Six months ago.

8
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,100
Good. Do you have any back or knee problems?

9
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,100
Nope. I am in perfect health.

10
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,100
What do you do for a living, Mr. Stewart?

11
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,100
I'm a photographer.

12
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,100
Interesting. What do you photograph?

13
00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:00,100
Everything. The American scene. People, places, events.

14
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,100
Did you ever think of photographing an aerobics class?

15
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:09,100
No...I can't remember taking pictures of people exercising.

16
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,100
But don't you think it'd be a good subject?

17
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Sure.

18
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,100
I need some good photos for my advertising, Mr. Stewart.

19
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Maybe you can photogragh a class,

20
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
and I can give you and Mrs. Stewart

21
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,100
a month of classes ree.

22
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
When can I photograph a class?

23
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,100
Anytime.

24
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
How about today?

25
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,100
Terrific!

26
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Hi.

27
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
Oh, hi.

28
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,100
Oh, hi.

29
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Are we ready to go?

30
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,100
Yeah. Yeah. Let's get in our lines.

31
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,100
We're going to take it slow first.

32
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Stretch up...and we're going to go left first ...

33
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:58,100
2,3,4 ... now switch. ... 2 3 4

34
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,100
OK, hold to the right.

35
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Sunrises. Stretch it out. Flat back.

36
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Bring it up ... and twists ... and side ... 2, 3 ...

37
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:31,100
and left ... push ... push ... turn ... hit the floor.

38
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Take it side again .... OK, and switch. Stretch it out.

39
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,100
And we're going to warm down with a tango.

40
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Left, right. Enjoy it.

41
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:09,100
Richard, did you go to the Davis Aerobics class today? Richard

42
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Yes, I went to the aerobics class today.

43
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,100
What is wrong with you?

44
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Nothing. I am in excellent health.

45
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,100
I have ideal blood pressure. A perfect heart.

46
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,100
In other words, I'm in wonderful condition.

47
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Richard, did you go to the aerobics class, really? Richard

48
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
And don't forget to invite Susan for dinner.

49
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,100
And your legs don't hurt?

50
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,100
Hurt? What do you mean?

51
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,100
What about your arms? Lift your arms up like this.

52
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,100
And they don't hurt not even a little?

53
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
Nope.

54
00:12:50,100 --> 00:13:00,100
You are in great condition. I can't believe it!
