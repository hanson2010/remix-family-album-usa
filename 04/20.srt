1
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,100
Don't worry, Alexandra.

2
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
We'll find the owner.

3
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
How, Robbie?

4
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,100
Let me think.

5
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Gemma, sit. Gemma

6
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Good Gemma.

7
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Give me your paw.

8
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Good Gemma.

9
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
This dog is well trained.

10
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,100
She likes you, too.

11
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
So how are we going to find the owners?

12
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
With a little help from the ASPCA,

13
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,100
the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

14
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
They're the ones.

15
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
We once found a cat.

16
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
She was caught in the branches of our tree.

17
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,100
And Dad called the ASPCA.

18
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,100
They came and solved the problem.

19
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,100
Robbie, let's call them. Robbie

20
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:46,100
Let me see -- ASPCA....

21
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:52,100
Here it is.

22
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,100
ASPCA Animal Shelter. ASPCA

23
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:59,100
555-7700.

24
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:12,100
(beep...)

25
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Hello, ASPCA.

26
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,100
Hello, my name is Robbie Stewart.

27
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,100
I have a lost dog I'd like to bring to you.

28
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
How late are you open?

29
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,100
We're open till nine P.M.

30
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Thank you.

31
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
I'll bring the dog over by nine.

32
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Thanks.

33
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,100
Bye.

34
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
Thanks.

35
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,100
Good-bye.

36
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,100
They're still open?

37
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
They're open until nine o'clock.

38
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
We have two and a half hours.

39
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Let's take Gemma by there now.

40
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
They'll find the owner.

41
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
I hope so.

42
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,100
I'm so sad to see this little dog without her family.

43
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100
I'm sure they'll find the owner.

44
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,100
But if they don't, I'll adopt her.

45
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,100
She's so cute.

46
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,100
Look at those eyes.

47
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,100
She's hard to resist.

48
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Don't you just love her?

49
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,100
I'd like to keep her, too.

50
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
But I'll be going home to Greece

51
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,100
at the end of the semester.

52
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,100
She just wants love and affection.

53
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,100
Come on, Robbie.

54
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Let's get her to the animal shelter,

55
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,100
so they can find her owners quickly.

56
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,100
Don't worry, Gemma.

57
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
We'll get you home.

58
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
It's not easy being away from home.

59
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,100
Come on, poochie.

60
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,100
Atta girl!

61
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,100
Let's go.

62
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,100
We're off to the animal shelter.

63
00:11:38,100 --> 00:12:01,100
let's thank taotao

64
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Your name?

65
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Robbie Stewart. Robbie Stewart

66
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,100
And this is Alexandra Pappas.

67
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,100
Your name will do, Mr. Stewart.

68
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Your address?

69
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,100
46 Linden street, Riverdale. Riverdale

70
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Where did you find the dog?

71
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,100
She found us.

72
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,100
You tried calling the number on the collar?

73
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,100
Yes, but the number's no longer in service.

74
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,100
And there's no address on the dog tag?

75
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
There's no other information.

76
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
No ID number.

77
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,100
Without that, it's hard.

78
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,100
You will try to find the dog's owner.

79
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,100
Oh, we'll try, believe me.

80
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,100
And if you don't?

81
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Yes?

82
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,100
If you don't ... can I ... can I adopt the dog?

83
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,100
Why, yes.

84
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,100
If the owners don't claim the dog in forty-eight hours,

85
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,100
then you can apply for adoption.

86
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
How do I do that?

87
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
You really want to?

88
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,100
Yes, I'm serious.

89
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,100
If no one comes to claim Gemma,

90
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
I'd like to adopt her.

91
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,100
It's not difficult.
