1
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Sam, would you come in, please?

2
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,600
You sound like something's bothering you, Susan.

3
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,600
The sketches for the cover of the new doll book?

4
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
That's not it.

5
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Please sit down.

6
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Sure.

7
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:42,600
I need your advice on a personsal matter,

8
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
but it's not about me.

9
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,600
You need my advice on a personal matter,

10
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
and it's not about you.

11
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,600
It's about my grandfather.

12
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
What's the problem?

13
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,600
It won't sound like a big deal,

14
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
but it is.

15
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I had dinner with him Saturday,

16
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
and he's very unhappy about not working.

17
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,600
I thought he was retired

18
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
and pleased to be living with the family.

19
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
He is,

20
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,600
but there's so much energy and talent in the man,

21
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
and he doesn't get to use it.

22
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
But what can I do?

23
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
What kind of advice are you looking for?

24
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Simply this.

25
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,600
John Marchetta runs this company.

26
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
He founded this company.

27
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Right.

28
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,600
John Marchetta gave me my start here six years ago,

29
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,600
When I first graduated from college.

30
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,600
He gave me the chance to use my talents

31
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
and made me feel more confident.

32
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Right.

33
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Maybe he can do the same thing for your grandfather.

34
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Or at least give him some advice.

35
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Right.

36
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Then I've solved your problem.

37
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I can always depend on you, Sam.

38
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm glad to help.

39
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Shall I call Mr. Marchetta for you?

40
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,600
No, no. I'll do that.

41
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Thanks.

42
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Now, how's the Stewart family?

43
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Fine, thank you, Mr. Mrarchetta.

44
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Except for my grandfather.

45
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
What's wrong, Susan?

46
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
What's wrong with him?

47
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
He needs to work.

48
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,600
In fact, that is the reason why I'm here to see you.

49
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,600
I know you're building a new factory,

50
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,600
and I thought ... maybe ...

51
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
my grandfather is

52
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
so experienced in the construction trade,

53
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,600
he could be so valuable.

54
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Tell him to come and see me

55
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,600
at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

56
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
I have an idea that may solve the problem for him

57
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
and help a lot of other people.

58
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Really, Mr. Marchetta?

59
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Can I tell him that?

60
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Sure can.

61
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Ten o'clock in the morning. Here.

62
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Oh, thank you!
