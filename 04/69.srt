1
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Hi, everyone. Sorry I'm late.

2
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,000
But Alexandra and I

3
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
have been busy at work this morning

4
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,400
on the community-center project.

5
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,000
And we brought someone along who can help.

6
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You remember Charles Maxwell, Grandpa?

7
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
He's the editor of the Riverdale paper.

8
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He wrote some nice articles on Mom

9
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
when she was running for the school board.

10
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yes, I remember. You were a great help.

11
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Hi, Mr. Stewart.

12
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Hope to be a bigger help on the new community-center project.

13
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
From what Robbie and Alexandra have told me,

14
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
you people are making one big story.

15
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Let me introduce you, Mr. Maxwell.

16
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
This is Nat Baker,

17
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
who's responsible for this meeting,

18
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,600
and this is Joanne Thompson, and Abe Lucas,

19
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
who used to run the drugstore in town.

20
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Robbie and Alexandra told me

21
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
what you need to fix up the old library.

22
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,600
I am planning to write an editorial that I think will help you.

23
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Let's go. What are your questions?

24
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,600
OK. Now, I have ... first ... a couple of questions here.

25
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Have you talked to the community council?

26
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,600
And have you had an engineer come in to do an inspection?

27
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,600
OK, what do you need most of all?

28
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
People power.

29
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Men and women, young and old, to give us their time.

30
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
To do what?

31
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,600
To help scrub the building interior clean.

32
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
So that we can repaint it.

33
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,600
And you also need bodies to do repainting?

34
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
That's right.

35
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,600
And we'll also need some ladders

36
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
and some brushes and some paint.

37
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
When do you need the volunteers,

38
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
and where do they report?

39
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
I've got the council to agree

40
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,600
to open the building for us on the next four weekends.

41
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
How about furnishings?

42
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Are there any special requirements that I should list in the paper?

43
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Yes.

44
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Here is a copy of all the things we need to start with.

45
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Let's see. Four desks.

46
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Eight straight-back chairs. Thirty folding chairs.

47
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Six table lamps. Three end tables. One piano.

48
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
This is a good start.

49
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,600
These items shouldn't be difficult to come by

50
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
once I print the article in the paper.

51
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
This community has always been very generous.

52
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
I agree, Mr. Maxwell.

53
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,600
What you're saying is, in order for this center to succeed,

54
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
we need to put together volunteers

55
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,600
from the various generations of future users.

56
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
That's right.

57
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,600
And without their energy and stamina,

58
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
there's no way we can complete this project.

59
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,600
I've got it. Now give me some information about

60
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
how you see the building being used.

61
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Oh, here. On the ground floor we have the reception area ...

62
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,600
It's here, Robbie.

63
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Charles Maxwell lived up to his word.

64
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,600
"At the Stewart family home on Linden Street yesterday,

65
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,600
a group of caring Riverdale citizens gathered

66
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,600
to plan the refurbishing of the old library

67
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,600
to transform it into a new community center.

68
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,600
The original plan by the council

69
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,600
was tabled because of lack of funds.

70
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,600
The new plan needs you.

71
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,600
You could call it a community unity plan.

72
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,600
It needs your time, and it needs your energy.

73
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,600
And it needs your contributions of furniture,

74
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,600
paint, brushes, ladders, lamps, et cetera.

75
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,600
A list of these items and a volunteer form

76
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,600
can be picked up at the Riverdale Press offices.

77
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
By working together,

78
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,600
this community can do anything to benefit its citizens,

79
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,600
and we know you will all work together

80
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
towards refurbishing the old library

81
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,600
and making it a new community center.

82
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Charles Maxwell, Editor."
