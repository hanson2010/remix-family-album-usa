00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Welcome to the Watermill Inn.

2
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Oh, Richard,

3
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
it's exactly as it was when we were married!

4
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
And when I got married.

5
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Even the old patchwork quilt is the same!

6
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,600
My great-grandmother made that quilt

7
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
when Teddy Roosevelt was President.

8
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,600
In those days, when they made quilts.

9
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
they cut patches

10
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,600
from the old clothing of every member in the family

11
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
so that each one would be a part of it.

12
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
What a lovely tradition!

13
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Thank you for calling us.

14
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
I remember you and your wife

15
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
from the first time you stayed with us.

16
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,600
We were very young.

17
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
And very much in love.

18
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
We have a baby now.

19
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,600
How wonderful! A boy or a girl?

20
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
A boy - Max.

21
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Do you have a picture?

22
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,600
Would a professional photographer be without a picture?

23
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Oh, he's adorable!

24
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
And very bright.

25
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Like his father. A real Stewart.

26
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
And very good-looking, like his mother.

27
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Well, it's nice to have you with us again.

28
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Next time, bring the baby.

29
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,600
You see, Richard? Max is welcome here.

30
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Not on our anniversary.

31
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
This vacation is for you and me.

32
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,600
If there's anything you need, please call me.

33
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
I'll be in the front office all day.

34
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Oh, I took the liberty of ordering some breakfast for you.

35
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Just put it over there, Charles.

36
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Thank you, Charles.

37
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Compliments of the Watermill Inn. Watermill Inn

38
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Thank you.

39
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Thank you so much.

40
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Now, this is my idea of a good time.

41
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Let's see ... hotcakes and maple syrup, with scrambled eggs.

42
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Umm... smell that coffee... cinnamon and cloves.

43
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Homemade buttermilk biscuits.

44
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Slices of orange with burnt honey.

45
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Let's eat!

46
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
First I want to call home

47
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
and check on your mother and the baby.

48
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Honey, if there were any problems,

49
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
she would call us.

50
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
She doesn't know we've changed hotels.

51
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
You're right. Of course.

52
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Hello, operator.

53
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,600
I'd like to call Riverdale, New York.

54
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:34,600
This food is heavenly, isn't it?

55
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
This whole place is heavenly.

56
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Do you remember that old desk?

57
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Mrs. Montefiore told me that Montefiore

58
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
George Washington sat at that desk

59
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
and wrote to his wife Martha.

60
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
What do you want to do after breakfast?

61
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,600
Why don't we take a walk down to the river?

62
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
In the rain?

63
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,600
No. Look out the window. The sun is shining!

64
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Now this is my idea of a good time!
