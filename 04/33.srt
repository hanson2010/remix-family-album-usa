1
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,600
How do you do?

2
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Hello.

3
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
I'm Ralph Riley.

4
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,600
I'm Richard Stewart, and this is my wife, Marilyn.

5
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Pleased to meet you.

6
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Likewise, Mr. Riley.

7
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Please, sit down. What can I do for you?

8
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
We'd like to discuss a mortgage.

9
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
For a house.

10
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Fine. Are you buying a house

11
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
or are you refinancing your present home?

12
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
We're planning to buy a house.

13
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,600
And we'd like to find out about a mortgage.

14
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
We are customers of the bank.

15
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,600
As a matter of fact, my whole family banks here.

16
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
I have some questions to ask.

17
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Do you own your house or do you rent?

18
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Neither.

19
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,600
We live with my parents, Dr. and Mrs. Philip Stewart.

20
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,600
And how old are you?

21
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
I'm twenty-nine.

22
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
I'm thirty.

23
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,600
And, Mr. Stewart, what is your occupation?

24
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
I'm a freelance photographer.

25
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
And, Mrs. Stewart, are you working?

26
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Yes. I'm a designer, and I work in a boutique.

27
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Did you bring any savings or salary information?

28
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Last year's tax forms?

29
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Yes. Here they are.

30
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:38,600
OK. What... what kind of house did you have in mind?

31
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
We're talking about buying

32
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
a two-bedroom house in Mount Kisco.

33
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Here are the financial details on the house.

34
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Thank you.

35
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Are you prepared to make a ten-percent down payment?

36
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Yes, we are.

37
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Payments over thirty years?

38
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Yes.

39
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Do you think we can get a loan?

40
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Well, it depends. Do you own any other property?

41
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Any stocks or bonds?

42
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,600
No.

43
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,600
I see. Then you don't have any collateral.

44
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Perhaps you could get a guarantor -

45
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,600
someone to sign for the loan for you.

46
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Why is that necessary?

47
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Since you don't have enough income,

48
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
and you don't already own any property,

49
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
the bank needs to be sure

50
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
you can pay the mortgage every month.

51
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,600
A guarantor is responsible for the loan

52
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
if you can't make the payments.

53
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:39,600
I see. Well, the idea of buying a house is exciting.

54
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Thank you, Mr. Riley. We'll read this over carefully.

55
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Thank you.

56
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Good-bye. Thanks.

57
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Good-bye. And hope to see you soon.

58
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
I hope so, too.

59
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Take care.

60
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Good-bye.

61
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:12,200
It all sounded so easy

62
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,600
until they mentioned needing collateral or a guarantor.

63
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,600
We have no collateral.

64
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,600
And I don't think it's a good idea

65
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
to ask Dad to sign as a guarantor.

66
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
I don't feel right about it.

67
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
I understand your feelings about it, Richard.

68
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Now, tell me, what's the problem?

69
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,600
We can get a loan from the bank

70
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
if we can put up some collateral.

71
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,600
And we don't own anything to use as collateral.

72
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Or someone can sign with us as a guarantor.

73
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Why don't you speak to Dad?

74
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,600
No. If we buy a house, I want to be able to handle it alone.

75
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Everybody needs help sometimes, Richard.

76
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,600
I understand Richard's feelings about it, Ellen.

77
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,600
In two or three months, I'll have an advance on my book

78
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
and be able to put more money down.

79
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
What about the house in Mount Kisco?

80
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Somebody else'll buy it by then.

81
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Then there'll be other houses, Marilyn.

82
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Richard has a point. You're just beginning to look.

83
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
We're in no great rush. It's true.

84
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
This has been a great learning experience for us, Marilyn.

85
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Talking to the real-estate agent.

86
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Looking at the houses.

87
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Talking to the loan officer at the bank.

88
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,600
It has been a learning experience. That's true.

89
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,600
I think you're doing the right thing. Taking your time.

90
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Looking around. Especially with a purchase of this kind.

91
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
You're talking about a lot of money.

92
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,600
We'll call Mrs. Martinelli and tell her to keep looking for us.

93
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
And I'll call Mr. Riley at the bank

94
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,600
and tell him we'll see him in a couple of months.

95
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,600
And if you ever need Dad or me to help you ...

96
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
We know.

97
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,600
You know we'll be there for you.

98
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,600
It's a Stewart tradition. We're a family.
