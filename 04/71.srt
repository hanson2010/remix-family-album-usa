1
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,600
You ready for the next problem?

2
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
You know what?

3
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
I can't look at another number.

4
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
How about a lemonade break?

5
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Sure.

6
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Oh, by the way,

7
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,600
when is your plane reservation for your flight to Athens?

8
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Sunday. Why?

9
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Would you be able to come over Saturday night?

10
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Yes.

11
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
I should be finished packing by then.

12
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,600
My folks are giving me a little graduation party.

13
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Terrific!

14
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,600
I'll pick you up.

15
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
That isn't necessary.

16
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
My dad's letting me borrow the car.

17
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Oh, well, that would be very nice.

18
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
About eight o'clock?

19
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Eight o'clock is fine.

20
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Great! It's a date.

21
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Who's going to be there?

22
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Just my friend Mike and a few kids from school.

23
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,600
I'm going to miss all of you.

24
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
You've been like a second family to me.

25
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
We're going to miss you.

26
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Maybe you could come to visit me in Greece?

27
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
I'm counting on it.

28
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Wonderful!

29
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Are you excited about graduating from high school?

30
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Sure... and a little scared.

31
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Scared? Why?

32
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Aren't you a little scared?

33
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,600
I was when I first came to the United States.

34
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
I'd never been away from home,

35
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,600
and I didn't know what it would be like.

36
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,600
But then I found out that people are the same everywhere

37
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
once you get to know them.

38
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
I'm glad I got to know you.

39
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Thank you.

40
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,600
I'm glad I got to know you, and your family.

41
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Wouldn't it be nice if we could skip the examinations

42
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
and get right to the graduation party?

43
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
It would be very nice.

44
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,600
But that isn't the way it works.

45
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
So... back to work.

46
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Good night, Robbie.

47
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Good night, Mrs. Stewart.

48
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Thank you for dinner.

49
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Good night, Alexandra.

50
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Will you be all right?

51
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Yes. The Molinas are waiting for me.

52
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Good night, Alexandra.

53
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,600
I'll pick you up on Saturday night, OK?

54
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Yes.

55
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,600
I have to run.

56
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Good night, Robbie.

57
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:25,600
She's really a good friend, isn't she?

58
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Yeah.

59
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,600
You are going to miss her.

60
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Am I going to miss her?

61
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
That's what I said!

62
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
You are going to miss her!

63
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,600
I'm going to miss her,

64
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,600
and my math teacher's going to miss her.

65
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Well, you can write to her.

66
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
It's not the same.

67
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
How does that look, Rob?

68
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Great! Pass me the hammer.

69
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
You got it!

70
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,600
You're sure Alexandra's going to be surprised?

71
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Absolutely.

72
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,600
She has no idea that the party is in her honor.

73
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Millie, did you bring the tapes for dancing?

74
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
They're in my bag.

75
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
What did you bring?

76
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Some rock 'n' roll.

77
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Perfect! Alexandra will love it!

78
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,600
I can't wait to see her face when she walks in here tonight.

79
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
What about the cake?

80
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
My mom's decorating it right now.

81
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Robbie, there's a phone call for you.

82
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
It's Alexandra.

83
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
She sounds upset.

84
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
OK.

85
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
I'll take it in there.

86
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:48,600
Hi, Alexandra.

87
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,600
What? You what?

88
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Oh no!
