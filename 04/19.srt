1
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Robbie, this new Walkman is absolutely wonderful.

2
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Richard and Marilyn bought it for me for my birthday.

3
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,600
They're so thoughtful.

4
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,600
You are very lucky, Robbie, to have such a nice family.

5
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Is something wrong, Alexandra?

6
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
No, nothing.

7
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Yes, there is.

8
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
I can tell.

9
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
What's the matter?

10
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Come on, you can tell me.

11
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
What's up?

12
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
I don't know.

13
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Something's wrong.

14
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,600
OK, let's talk.

15
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,600
I received a letter from my parents this morning.

16
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Did they write some bad news?

17
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
No.

18
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Well, then why are you so sad?

19
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I miss them.

20
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
I miss them very much.

21
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
I'm sorry, Alexandra.

22
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
But I understand.

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,600
The Molinas treat me so nicely, Molina

24
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,600
and I love being with your family so much...

25
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,600
but when I received the letter

26
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
with photographs of my family, I cried.

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,600
I cried because I miss them all.

28
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
You really miss your family, don't you?

29
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Yes. I know I must seem silly.

30
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
It's not like I have nobody.

31
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I like the Molinas very much,

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
and they're so kind to me.

33
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Hey, why don't we go out

34
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
for a cheeseburger and french fries?

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
That'll cheer you up.

36
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
And you can use my Walkman.

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
That's a good idea.

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
But if we go out,

39
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,600
please don't complain

40
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
about your math teacher or your math homework.

41
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
I want to have fun.

42
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
So do I.

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
I have to turn off the lights,

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
or else my father will get really angry.

45
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
He says I never turn them out when I leave.

46
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
If they come home and they're on...

47
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Do you hear something?

48
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Yes.

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
What was that?

50
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
It sounded like a dog barking.

51
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,600
It sounded like a dog barking right here.

52
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Yeah.

53
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,600
A dog!

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
A springer spaniel!

55
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Come on in!

56
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Make yourself at home.

57
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Oh, you poor little thing.

58
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Come here.

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Come on.

60
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Poor baby.

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Where did you come from?

62
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Her name's Gemma,

63
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
and she belongs to Mr. and Mrs. Levinson.

64
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
There's a phone number

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,600
555-8448.

66
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Robbie, maybe you should call them Robbie

67
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
and tell the Levinsons we have their cute little spaniel.

68
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
I've always wanted a springer spaniel.

69
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
She's so cute.

70
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:20,600
The number you are calling "555-8448"

71
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
is no longer in service.

72
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,600
The number's no longer in service.

73
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Oh, you poor, poor baby.

74
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
You've lost your family.

75
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
We'll find them.

76
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Don't worry, Alexandra.
