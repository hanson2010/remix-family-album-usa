Fine, Somsak. And you?

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Fine, thank you.

5
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
This is my friend Harry Bennett.

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Pleased to meet you.

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Very nice to meet you.

Follow me, please.

10
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
I like it here.

11
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,100
I do, too. I come here often.

12
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,100
A special place for special people.

13
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
Thank you, Somsak.

14
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:37,100
Well! Nice restaurant.

15
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,100
Would you like something to drink?

16
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Yes, I'd like a glass of ginger ale with ice.

17
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Harry, what would you like? Harry

18
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,100
Do you have a dry white wine?

19
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,100
How about a California chablis?

20
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Chablis is fine.

21
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,100
What would you like to eat?

22
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,100
I'd like the mee krob.

23
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Harry, would you like to see a menu? Harry

24
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,100
No, it's Ok.

25
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,100
I'll have the mee krob also.

26
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,100
What is it?

27
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,100
Crispy fried noodles. I love them.

28
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,100
May I bring you a salad?

29
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,100
Oh yes.

30
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
What do you recommend today?

31
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
I recommend rose-petal salad.

32
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Special for new friends.

33
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Rose-petal salad?

34
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,100
Why not?

35
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
I'll take care of everything.

36
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:29,100
I hope you're hungry.

37
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,100
What? Oh, yes. Starving. Well, I...

38
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Well, I ...

39
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:43,100
What do you do at Universe Toy Company?

40
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,100
I'm the vice-president of new toy development.

41
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,100
Terrific!

42
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,100
I know you 're a CPA.

43
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
That's true. Harry Bennett,

44
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
certified public accountant.

45
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
I love numbers.

46
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
I do some work for Smith and Dale,

47
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Your company's accounting firm.

48
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,100
And so...

49
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Here we are.

50
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Yes.

51
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,100
I have a daughter.

52
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
I know. How old is she?

53
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
She's nine years old.

54
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,100
That's a nice age. What's her name?

55
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,100
Michelle. Michelle

56
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,100
Do you have a picture of her?

57
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:29,100
She's very pretty.

58
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,100
Thank you.

59
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:39,100
Rose-petal salad.

60
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,100
And there's a phone call for you, Mr. Bennett. Bennett

61
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Excuse me, Susan.

62
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,100
I hope nothing is wrong.

63
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
I'll get the rest of the dinner.

64
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Excuse me.

65
00:11:51,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Please forgive me, Susan, but...

66
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
I have to leave. I feel terrible, but...

67
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,100
What's the matter?

68
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,100
My daughter isn't feeling well.

69
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100
Oh no! Is it serious?

70
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,100
I don't know. The baby-sitter says she has a stomachache,

71
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,100
and she's crying.

72
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,100
I'll have to go home.

73
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
Will you forgive me?

74
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,100
Of course. I'm so sorry for Michelle.

75
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,100
And you didn't have a chance to eat.

76
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
Oh, it's OK.

77
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Let me take you home first.

78
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
No, no. Please, go ahead.

79
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,100
It's our first date.

80
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,100
We'll make another.

81
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,100
Please don't worry.

82
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,100
I'll phone you.

83
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,100
I hope your daughter is all right. Good-bye.

84
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,100
Good-bye.
