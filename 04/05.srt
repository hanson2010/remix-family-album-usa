00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Ah! Miss Stewart! Welcome!

2
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
How are you?

3
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Fine, Somsak. And you?

4
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Fine, thank you.

5
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
This is my friend Harry Bennett.

6
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Pleased to meet you.

7
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Very nice to meet you.

8
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Any friend of Miss Stewart's is welcome at Somsak's.

9
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Follow me, please.

10
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
I like it here.

11
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,600
I do, too. I come here often.

12
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,600
A special place for special people.

13
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Thank you, Somsak.

14
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Well! Nice restaurant.

15
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Would you like something to drink?

16
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Yes, I'd like a glass of ginger ale with ice.

17
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Harry, what would you like?

18
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Do you have a dry white wine?

19
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
How about a California chablis?

20
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Chablis is fine.

21
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
What would you like to eat?

22
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I'd like the mee krob.

23
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Harry, would you like to see a menu?

24
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
No, it's Ok.

25
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
I'll have the mee krob also.

26
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
What is it?

27
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Crispy fried noodles. I love them.

28
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
May I bring you a salad?

29
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Oh yes.

30
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
What do you recommend today?

31
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
I recommend rose-petal salad.

32
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Special for new friends.

33
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Rose-petal salad?

34
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Why not?

35
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
I'll take care of everything.

36
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,600
I hope you're hungry.

37
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,600
What? Oh, yes. Starving. Well, I...

38
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Well, I...

39
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,600
What do you do at Universe Toy Company?

40
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,600
I'm the vice-president of new toy development.

41
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Terrific!

42
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,600
I know you're a CPA.

43
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
That's true. Harry Bennett,

44
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
certified public accountant.

45
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
I love numbers.

46
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
I do some work for Smith and Dale,

47
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Your company's accounting firm.

48
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
And so...

49
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Here we are.

50
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Yes.

51
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
I have a daughter.

52
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
I know. How old is she?

53
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
She's nine years old.

54
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
That's a nice age. What's her name?

55
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Michelle.

56
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Do you have a picture of her?

57
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:23,600
She's very pretty.

58
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Thank you.

59
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Rose-petal salad.

60
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,600
And there's a phone call for you, Mr. Bennett.

61
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Excuse me, Susan.

62
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,600
I hope nothing is wrong.

63
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
I'll get the rest of the dinner.

64
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Excuse me.

65
00:11:45,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Please forgive me, Susan, but...

66
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,600
I have to leave. I feel terrible, but...

67
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
What's the matter?

68
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,600
My daughter isn't feeling well.

69
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Oh no! Is it serious?

70
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,600
I don't know. The baby-sitter says she has a stomachache,

71
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
and she's crying.

72
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
I'll have to go home.

73
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Will you forgive me?

74
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Of course. I'm so sorry for Michelle.

75
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600
And you didn't have a chance to eat.

76
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Oh, it's OK.

77
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Let me take you home first.

78
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
No, no. Please, go ahead.

79
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
It's our first date.

80
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
We'll make another.

81
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Please don't worry.

82
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,600
I'll phone you.

83
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,600
I hope your daughter is all right. Good-bye.

84
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Good-bye.
