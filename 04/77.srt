1
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Do you like the dress?

2
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
I love it.

3
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
I designed it myself.

4
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
It's beautiful.

5
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Are you ready?

6
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
We're supposed to be there

7
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
before the guests arrive.

8
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
I know. I know.

9
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Help me with this tie, will you?

10
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Honey, I'm scared to death.

11
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,600
But this is what you've been working for all these years.

12
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
No, no.

13
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
I worked to put together a book of photographs.

14
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
This is show business.

15
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Well, it's all part of the same job.

16
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Just relax and enjoy it.

17
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,600
You're right.

18
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,600
I earned this, and I'm going to enjoy it.

19
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,600
As soon as I recover from my nervous breakdown.

20
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,600
What are you afraid of?

21
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Everything.

22
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
A critic was there this morning.

23
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
He probably hates my work.

24
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,600
I have to sign copies of my book for a lot of people

25
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I never met before.

26
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
My new shoes hurt my feet...

27
00:09:51,600 --> 00:10:03,600
You're going to be a great success.

28
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Are you ready?

29
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
As soon as I get these cuff links on.

30
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Let me help.

31
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Mom and Dad are already on their way down to the gallery.

32
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:25,600
There! You look very attractive.

33
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Thank you.

34
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Well, I suppose I've run out of excuses.

35
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Mm-hmm. Let's go...

36
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Oh, one minute.

37
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Before we go to the gallery,

38
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
I just want to tell you

39
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
that I never could have done this book

40
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
without your help and your love.

41
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,600
I appreciate it.

42
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Thanks.

43
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Now, no more stalling.

44
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
What is it?

45
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
There's nobody here!

46
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Of course not, Richard.

47
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Your show doesn't begin until eight thirty.

48
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Oh. Right.

49
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Richard! Welcome! Good luck tonight!

50
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Well, thanks.

51
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
This is my publisher, Harvey Carlson.

52
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
You've met my wife Marilyn...

53
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Charmed.

54
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
My mother, Ellen Stewart.

55
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Harvey Carlson.

56
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
It's good to meet you.

57
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,600
This is my father, Dr. Philip Stewart...

58
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Nice to meet you, Mr. Carlson.

59
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
My brother Robbie...

60
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Hi.

61
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Hi.

62
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
And this is my sister Susan and her husband Harry Bennett

63
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
and his daughter Michelle.

64
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
It's nice to meet you.

65
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,600
And this gentleman is my grandfather, Malcolm Stewart.

66
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Welcome, Mr. Stewart.

67
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Well, make yourselves comfortable.

68
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,600
There are hors d'oeuvres at the table, fruit punch at the bar.

69
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Help yourselves.

70
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Can I get you something, Mr. Stewart?

71
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
No, thank you.

72
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
You can feel very proud of your grandson, Mr. Stewart.

73
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
I do.

74
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,600
I'm proud of all my grandchildren, Mr. Carlson.

75
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Of course.

76
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Feel free to look around.

77
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
If you need anything, just ask.

78
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Thank you.

79
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Harvey? Harvey

80
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Yes?

81
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Did Mitchell Johnson's review come out yet?

82
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Not yet.

83
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
The newspapers don't come out till about ten o'clock.

84
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
When they come out, we'll get it.

85
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Thanks.

86
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Ready?

87
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Yes. Have the people arrived?

88
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
The guests are waiting.

89
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Tom's about to open the doors.

90
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Good luck! And stop worrying!

91
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
They're going to love it.
