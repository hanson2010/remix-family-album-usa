1
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Oh, Daddy!

2
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
We had such a good time at the aquarium.

3
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
I saw a real shark.

4
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
I could almost touch it.

5
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
I'm so glad.

6
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Hi. Michelle,

7
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
why don't you introduce everybody to Susan?

8
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Hi, Susan.

9
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,600
I'd like you to meet Audrey and her mother, Mrs. Cooper.

10
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Hello, Audrey.

11
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Cooper.

12
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
I'm Susan Stewart.

13
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
And this is Shirley and Nicole.

14
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Hi, girls.

15
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Come on in.

16
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Come on in, Mrs. Cooper.

17
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Come on in, everybody.

18
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
The aquarium was so exciting.

19
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I had never been there before.

20
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
The girls learned a great deal.

21
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Frankly, so did I.

22
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Well, please sit down

23
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
and tell us all about it during lunch.

24
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
We prepared some tuna fish

25
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
and cheese sandwiches for lunch.

26
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,600
I love tuna fish.

27
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Don't you, Audrey?

28
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,600
I remember when I used to be a Girl Scout.

29
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
My mother would take us everywhere, too.

30
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Susan, I understand you're in the toy business.

31
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Yes, I am.

32
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,600
My company manufactures toys and games for children.

33
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Susan's vice-president in charge of new toys and games.

34
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
And the marketing of new toys and games.

35
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Can we test a new game for you, Susan?

36
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
That's an excellent idea, Michelle.

37
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
I happen to have

38
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
a game which I brought home to study.

39
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Let us try it!

40
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
Do you want to play?

41
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Nicole? Shirley? Audrey?

42
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,600
We tested it last week on twelve- to fifteen-year-olds,

43
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,600
and they found it to be too easy

44
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
in other words... boring.

45
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,600
We think it might be just right for ten- to twelve-year-olds.

46
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
That's us, Susan.

47
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
First, you shuffle the deck

48
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,600
and lay them face down.

49
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Then you select the leader.

50
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
I'll be the leader.

51
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,600
The leader takes the first ten cards

52
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
and lays them face up on this stand.

53
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:57,600
h-t-e-r-c-z-e-p-e-s.

54
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Everyone gets a turn, going counterclockwise,

55
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
left to right.

56
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,600
You have thirty seconds to make a word,

57
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
using as many letters as possible.

58
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,600
You get one point for each letter,

59
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,600
plus the person with the longest word gets ten extra points.

60
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,600
The first one to get one hundred points wins.

61
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
That's easy.

62
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
OK, let's go around the table.

63
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
You first, Audrey.

64
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Chest - c-h-e-s-t.

65
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Good.

66
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
That's five points.

67
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Next, Nicole.

68
00:10:48,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Three - t-h-r-e-e.

69
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
OK.

70
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
That's five points also.

71
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
It's your turn, Shirley.

72
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Creep - c-r-e-e-p.

73
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Creep.

74
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
That's another five-letter word.

75
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Five points.

76
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
So far, you're all tied.

77
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Sheet - s-h-e-e-t.

78
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Sheet is a five-letter word.

79
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Michelle, your turn.

80
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Cheese - c-h-e-e-s-e.

81
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Terrific!

82
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Michelle wins with a six-letter word,

83
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,600
plus she gets an additional ten points

84
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
for a total of sixteen points.

85
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
How are you enjoying the game so far?

86
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
I think it's too easy.

87
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Too easy?

88
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Michelle!

89
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
It's OK, Harry.

90
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Michelle is quite right.

91
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
She just said it's too easy.

92
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Well, I like the game.

93
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
I enjoyed lunch, Susan.

94
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Thank you so much,

95
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
but we have to get going

96
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
to meet the rest of the troop at two o'clock at the museum.

97
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Oh, it was nice meeting all of you.

98
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,600
I hope you have a wonderful time

99
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
at the Museum of Natural History.

100
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Good-bye, everybody.

101
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Have a good time.

102
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Bye.

103
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
See you in front of the museum at five o'clock.

104
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Oh, OK.

105
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Thanks, Mr. Bennett.

106
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
That'll be fine.

107
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
And thanks again for the lunch and for the game.

108
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Good-bye, Susan.

109
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
It's not a bad game.

110
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
It's just ... slow.

111
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Just slow.

112
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,600
You helped save our company a lot of money.

113
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Bye-bye.

114
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:48,600
You are wonderful with kids.

115
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,600
I am.

116
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Isn't there a conversation that we have to finish?
