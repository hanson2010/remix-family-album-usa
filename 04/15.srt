1
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Here's the bag.

2
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,100
Will he be OK, Dad?

3
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,100
I hope so.

4
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:08,100
That's it.

5
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,100
That's the way.

6
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
That's it. There.

7
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,100
Oh, it's going to be all right.

8
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,100
That's it.

9
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
Wrap him in the blanket, Dad!

10
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,100
That's it. That's it.

11
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
It's all right, Albert.

12
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,100
You're going to be OK.

13
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,100
I want my daddy!

14
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,100
We'll take you to him.

15
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,100
Easy now. Easy does it. That's it.

16
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Your dad is quite a guy.

17
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
I know, Grandpa.

18
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
How is he, Philip?

19
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
He's asleep.

20
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
He's going to be fine.

21
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
How can I thank all of you?

22
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,100
Thank my son Robbie.

23
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,100
He pulled him out of the water.

24
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
I'm very grateful, Robbie.

25
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
Dad saved him, not me.

26
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
I'm so thankful to all of you.

27
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,100
So long.

28
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,100
He's a lucky boy.

29
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Well, what do you say we get back to our fishing?

30
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
That's a great idea.

31
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,100
Uh-oh. It's probably the hospital.

32
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,100
I have to get to a phone.

33
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,100
It probably means we can't stay.

34
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,100
That's OK.

35
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:23,100
One of my patients has a high fever,

36
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
and I have to go to the hospital.

37
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
I'm sorry, Robbie.

38
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
I guess I ruined your day.

39
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,100
You didn't ruin my day, Dad.

40
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:38,100
I understand. I really do.

41
00:16:38,100 --> 00:17:06,100
Why are you back so early?

42
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,100
Philip had to go back to the hospital. Philip

43
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,100
He had an emergency.

44
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
Oh, that's too bad, Robbie.

45
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,100
Did it spoil your fun?

46
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,100
No, Mom. We had a great time.

47
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
Well, did you do any fishing?

48
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,100
Yeah, we caught lots of them. Look!

49
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:27,100
They had a special on frozen fish down at the supermarket.

50
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,100
Oh, you really had a bad day.

51
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
We had a good day.

52
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,100
Robbie pulled a boy out of the water. Robbie

53
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
And Dad saved his life.

54
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
He's a terrific doctor, Mom.

55
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
I know.

56
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:57,100
Hi, Pop. Hi, Son.

57
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,100
Hello, Dad.

58
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,100
What a day!

59
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
How about a cup of coffee, Son?

60
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
I'd love a cup of coffee.

61
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:13,100
How was the patient?

62
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,100
She'll be fine.

63
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Was it serious?

64
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
No.

65
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,100
Until today, I was never really interested in medicine.

66
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,100
Well, it's hard work.

67
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,100
Now I know.

68
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,100
I had a good time today, Robbie.

69
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,100
Me, too.

70
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Why don't we do it again?

71
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Can we? When?

72
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
How about next Saturday?

73
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,100
Won't you be busy?

74
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,100
I'm changing my schedule.

75
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Well, do we have a date?

76
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,100
We sure do, Dad.

77
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,100
Grandpa, can you come?

78
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
I have other plans, Robbie.

79
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:01,100
But I think you two can have a good time together without me.

80
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:08,100
No, Dad, and certainly not without the right magic.
