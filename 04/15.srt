1
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Here's the bag.

2
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Will he be OK, Dad?

3
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
I hope so.

4
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,600
That's it.

5
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
That's the way.

6
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
That's it. There.

7
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Oh, it's going to be all right.

8
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
That's it.

9
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Wrap him in the blanket, Dad!

10
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
That's it. That's it.

11
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
It's all right, Albert.

12
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
You're going to be OK.

13
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,600
I want my daddy!

14
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
We'll take you to him.

15
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,600
Easy now. Easy does it. That's it.

16
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Your dad is quite a guy.

17
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
I know, Grandpa.

18
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
How is he, Philip?

19
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
He's asleep.

20
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
He's going to be fine.

21
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
How can I thank all of you?

22
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Thank my son Robbie.

23
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
He pulled him out of the water.

24
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
I'm very grateful, Robbie.

25
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Dad saved him, not me.

26
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
I'm so thankful to all of you.

27
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,600
So long.

28
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,600
He's a lucky boy.

29
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Well, what do you say we get back to our fishing?

30
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
That's a great idea.

31
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Uh-oh. It's probably the hospital.

32
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
I have to get to a phone.

33
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,600
It probably means we can't stay.

34
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
That's OK.

35
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:39,600
One of my patients has a high fever,

36
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
and I have to go to the hospital.

37
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
I'm sorry, Robbie.

38
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
I guess I ruined your day.

39
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
You didn't ruin my day, Dad.

40
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,600
I understand. I really do.

41
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Why are you back so early?

42
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Philip had to go back to the hospital.

43
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
He had an emergency.

44
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Oh, that's too bad, Robbie.

45
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Did it spoil your fun?

46
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
No, Mom. We had a great time.

47
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Well, did you do any fishing?

48
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Yeah, we caught lots of them. Look!

49
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,600
They had a special on frozen fish down at the supermarket.

50
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Oh, you really had a bad day.

51
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
We had a good day.

52
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Robbie pulled a boy out of the water.

53
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
And Dad saved his life.

54
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
He's a terrific doctor, Mom.

55
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
I know.

56
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Hi, Pop. Hi, Son.

57
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Hello, Dad.

58
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
What a day!

59
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
How about a cup of coffee, Son?

60
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,600
I'd love a cup of coffee.

61
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:29,600
How was the patient?

62
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
She'll be fine.

63
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Was it serious?

64
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
No.

65
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Until today, I was never really interested in medicine.

66
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Well, it's hard work.

67
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Now I know.

68
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,600
I had a good time today, Robbie.

69
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Me, too.

70
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Why don't we do it again?

71
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Can we? When?

72
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
How about next Saturday?

73
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Won't you be busy?

74
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,600
I'm changing my schedule.

75
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Well, do we have a date?

76
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
We sure do, Dad.

77
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Grandpa, can you come?

78
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
I have other plans, Robbie.

79
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,600
But I think you two can have a good time together without me.

80
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,600
No, Dad, and certainly not without the right magic.
