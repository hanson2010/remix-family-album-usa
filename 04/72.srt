1
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
How about some music?

2
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,600
No, let's wait till Robbie gets back from the airport.

3
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Did she say why she had to leave today?

4
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
She told Robbie that her flight tomorrow was canceled,

5
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
so she had to take an earlier flight today.

6
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
This is terrible.

7
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Well, that must be him.

8
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Why is he blowing his horn like that?

9
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
I don't know.

10
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Maybe he's angry.

11
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Do you think we should take down the decorations?

12
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
They'll just make him sad.

13
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Too late now.

14
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
We should have done it sooner.

15
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Oh, here he comes.

16
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Hi.

17
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
How'd it go?

18
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,600
OK, I guess.

19
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Especially when Alexandra gave me a surprise...

20
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Yeah? What was it?

21
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
This!

22
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Alexandra!

23
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Hi! What happened?

24
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,600
I called my parents from the airport.

25
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
When I told them

26
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
my friends were giving me a party,

27
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
they insisted that I stay.

28
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,600
So now I'm taking a flight on Monday instead.

29
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
That's great! Terrific!

30
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
But how did you know the party was for you?

31
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Well, Robbie told me when he gave me this.

32
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Oh, it's so pretty!

33
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
It's lovely, Robbie.

34
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
All right!

35
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Now we can really start the party!

36
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
No. Would you mind?

37
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
I'd like to say something first.

38
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Hear, hear!

39
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,600
I would just like to thank all of you,

40
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
my friends,

41
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,600
who have made my stay in the United States so wonderful.

42
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,600
And to Robbie and the Stewart family

43
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
for opening their home to me.

44
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,600
We should thank you.

45
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
You're a real friend!

46
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,600
And I also have a little surprise for you, Robbie.

47
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,600
A little going-away present.

48
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Thank you.

49
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Open it, please.

50
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
I think you might be amused.

51
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,600
OK. I can't believe it!

52
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,600
I guess we were thinking the same thought.

53
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
You had it engraved!

54
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Read it, Robbie.

55
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,600
"In friendship, always. Alexandra."

56
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
I knew we thought alike,

57
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
but this is too much!

58
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Thank you.

59
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
All right!

60
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Let's have some music!

61
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Miss Pappas?

62
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Mr. Stewart...

63
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Mrs. Stewart, may I have this dance?

64
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
My pleasure, Doctor.
