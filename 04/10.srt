1
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
I am exhausted. My new exercise class is so hard.

2
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Your new exercise class?

3
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Yeah. My new advanced exercise class.

4
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Why advanced?

5
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,600
My instructor thought that

6
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
the beginner's class was too easy for me.

7
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Too easy for you?

8
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Don't laugh. In the beginner's class,

9
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,600
they give you a chance to rest between exercises.

10
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
So?

11
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
The advanced class is nonstop.

12
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,600
I lift weights every morning for sixty minutes

13
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
without stopping.

14
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
No problem.

15
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Listen, Richard,

16
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,600
doing aerobics for an hour is a lot different than lifting weights.

17
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Yeah. Quite a bit different.

18
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
I think aerobics is easy.

19
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
I could work out in your class with no problem.

20
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,600
You think so?

21
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Oh, without a doubt.

22
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
When's the next class?

23
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock. Try it.

24
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Tomorrow morning after lifting weights,

25
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
I'll try aerobics.

26
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
It's a nap. Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.

27
00:03:44,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Aren't you going to the aerobics class this morning?

28
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Of Course. Easy. No sweat.

29
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,600
You are not going to be able to move

30
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
after this and the aerobics class.

31
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Are you kidding me?

32
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
It's going to be a piece of cake.

33
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,600
You want to bet?

34
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Yeah. What's the bet?

35
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,600
I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning

36
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
and not feel a thing!

37
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:44,600
The bet is, I win, and you cook dinner for the entire family.

38
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Or you win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

39
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
It's a bet.

40
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Ok. Call my instructor, Jack Davis, right now.

41
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
His number is 555-8842.

42
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
The advanced class starts at 10 o'clock.

43
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Well, it's 8:20 now.

44
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
It only takes eight minutes by bicycle to the aerobics class.

45
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Give him a call.

46
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Davis Aerobics Center for Good Health.

47
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Jack Davis, please.

48
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
This is Jack Davis.

49
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Hello. This is Richard Stewart.

50
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
My wife, Marilyn Stewart, is a member of your program.

51
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,600
I'd like to come to

52
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
the ten o'clock advanced class this morning.

53
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Oh, fine, fine. Be here a few minutes early.

54
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
You need to complete some forms before the class.

55
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Thanks. I'm on my way over.

56
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Good-bye.

57
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Bye-bye. It's all set. I'm going.

58
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Bye.

59
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Bye.

60
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
See you later.

61
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Good luck.

62
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Don't forget about the bet.

63
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Dinner for the entire family.

64
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
And that includes Susan.

65
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Don't you forget.
