1
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Philip... Ellen.

2
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Ah, Judge.

3
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
How are you?

4
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
I think it's time for the wedding to begin.

5
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,600
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

6
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Please take your places.

7
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
The wedding ceremony is about to begin.

8
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
OK, Jane. Start the music.

9
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Dearly beloved,

10
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,600
we are gathered here today

11
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,600
to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.

12
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Do either of you have any reason

13
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,600
why you should not be legally joined in marriage?

14
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Is there anyone present who can show

15
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
any just cause why these two people

16
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,600
should not be legally joined in marriage?

17
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Then, Harry Bennett, do you take Susan Stewart

18
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,600
to be your lawful, wedded wife?

19
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
I do.

20
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,600
And you, Susan Stewart,

21
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
do you take Harry Bennett

22
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
to be your lawful, wedded husband?

23
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,600
I do.

24
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
The rings, please.

25
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,600
I have them, Harry.

26
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:40,600
By the power vested in me by the laws of the State of New York,

27
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,600
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

28
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,600
You may kiss the bride now, Harry.
