Episode 23 - The Community Center

3
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Morning, Grandpa.

4
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Is something the matter, Grandpa?

5
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:10,600
The editorial in this paper has my friend Nat Baker real upset.

6
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Ah! I'll read it to you.

7
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,600
"The old library building on Chestnut Street,

8
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,600
which has been vacant for over a year now,

9
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,600
was supposed to be made into a community center

10
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
to serve the senior citizens

11
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
as well as the younger people of Riverdale.

12
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Due to lack of funds

13
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,600
for the repainting of the interior of the building

14
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
and for the furniture needed,

15
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,600
the plans for the community center

16
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,600
have been postponed indefinitely."

17
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,600
He's coming over to talk about it.

18
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Is it that serious a problem, Grandpa?

19
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
It is.

20
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Nat's not as lucky as I am, Robbie.

21
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
He doesn't have any family with him.

22
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
He lives alone

23
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,600
and depends on places like a community center

24
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,600
to be with people, people his own age.

25
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,600
But there's the old community center on Elm Street.

26
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
It's small,

27
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:16,600
and the problem is that it's set up primarily for kids to play.

28
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Ping-Pong tables, soda machines, and lots of music.

29
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
It's too noisy for some older people like Nat.

30
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
I never realized that.

31
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,600
It's hard for some older people to take all that noise.

32
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,600
That's why the new community center is a good idea.

33
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Part of the building for older people,

34
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
part of the building for younger people.

35
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
I see what you mean.

36
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
That must be Nat.

37
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
It could be Alexandra.

38
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,600
She's coming over this morning to help me with my math.

39
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Hi, Robbie.

40
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Hi, Alexandra. Come on in.

41
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Do you want something cold to drink?

42
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
I'd love some cola, please.

43
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Cola coming up.

44
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,600
I really appreciate you coming over to help me with my math.

45
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
My final exam is next Tuesday.

46
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,600
You're so good in all your other subjects.

47
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
I just can't understand

48
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
why you have so many problems with math.

49
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Hi, Alexandra.

50
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Hi, Mr. Stewart.

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
I thought that was Nat Baker who rang the front doorbell.

52
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Don't let me interrupt you.

53
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
No problem, Grandpa.

54
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
We're just having some cola

55
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
before getting to the tough stuff - math.

56
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,600
He'll do anything to avoid getting down to math lessons,

57
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Mr. Stewart.

58
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,600
I was the same way.

59
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Really, Grandpa?

60
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Really. I didn't like math.

61
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,600
I wasn't good at it, and I didn't like studying it.

62
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
But you had to be good at math.

63
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
You graduated from engineering school.

64
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,600
I was. But not in high school.

65
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,600
For some reason, I couldn't get a handle on it.

66
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Then, in college, I became good at it.

67
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Then there's hope for Robbie.

68
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
I can't wait.

69
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
You think I can just skip it now and get to it at college?

70
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
You'll never get to college to find out, Robbie,

71
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
if you skip it now.

72
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,600
That must be Nat.

73
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Sit down, Robbie. Let's get to work.

74
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:39,600
I'd like you to meet my friend Nat Baker.

75
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
This is Alexandra Pappas, and this is my grandson Robbie,

76
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
whom I think you've met once or twice before.

77
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Nice to meet you, Mr. Baker.

78
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Hi, Mr. Baker. We met before.

79
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Where?

80
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,600
In town. At the hardware store.

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,600
I remember now. Right. Hi.

82
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Hello, Alexandra.

83
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Don't let us keep you from your math tutoring, Robbie.

84
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
I know you want to get to it.

85
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Stay... stay.

86
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,600
I told you. He'll use any excuse to avoid math.

87
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Did you read the story in the paper, Malcolm?

88
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
I did.

89
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,600
It's a serious matter for a lot of us.

90
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
A serious matter.

91
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
It is. Come on out to the patio.

92
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
We'll talk about it out there.

93
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Thanks. Nice to meet you... again.

94
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,600
What's the problem?

95
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Come on! You'll hear about it.

96
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
There is a way, Malcolm.

97
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,600
We get our friends to roll their sleeves up and get to work.

98
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
It's certainly a good idea.

99
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
If I could take a look at the place,

100
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
I could probably tell what it requires to fix it up.

101
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,600
How much paint, how many hours of work...

102
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,600
That's what I came to ask you to do, Malcolm.

103
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,600
If you would supervise the refurbishing,

104
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I'll find the people to help do it.

105
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
I'll help too, Mr. Baker.

106
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,600
I can get some of my friends to go around the neighborhood

107
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
and collect the furniture we need.

108
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
I'll help.

109
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Tomorrow. Yes. We'll meet tomorrow morning, right here.

110
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Can we help?

111
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
I'd really like to.

112
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Sure.

113
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,600
We might need you to come through with your friends, Robbie.

114
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Not just to go around the neighborhood asking for furniture,

115
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
but to help with the paint job.

116
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,600
That's backbreaking work and may be too much for us.

117
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I'll do it. I'll talk to them.

118
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,600
And tomorrow morning we'll all meet here to discuss the plan?

119
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Tomorrow morning it is.

120
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Come in, come in. Please, come in.

121
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:24,600
I'd like you to meet my friend Malcolm Stewart.

122
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Malcolm, this is Joanne Thompson.

123
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Hello, Joanne. Nice to meet you.

124
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
My pleasure, Malcolm.

125
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,600
And this is Abe Lucas. You must remember Abe.

126
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
He ran the drugstore

127
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,600
and used to play drums with the jazz band on weekends.

128
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Oh, sure I do. Hi, Abe.

129
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Hello, Mr. Stewart.

130
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Malcolm, please.

131
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Hello, Malcolm.

132
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Sit down, sit down. Have some coffee.

133
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,600
And I've got some delicious Danish pastry for you.

134
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Where's your grandson Robbie and his friend Alexandra?

135
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Weren't they going to be here this morning?

136
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I thought so, too.

137
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,600
I'm surprised they're not here.

138
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Robbie left early this morning to meet Alexandra.

139
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Frankly, I thought they'd be here, but...

140
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,600
It's OK. I'm sure they meant well,

141
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
but they probably had other things on their minds.

142
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I understand you used to be in the construction business,

143
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Malcolm.

144
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I was, indeed.

145
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,600
I wonder if you would take a look at the old library

146
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,600
and make sure that it is in good condition

147
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
so that we don't have to worry about any structural problems.

148
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,600
When can I do that? I'd be happy to.

149
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
We've got permission to go inside the old building

150
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
during the week -

151
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Tuesday or Wednesday.

152
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,600
That's fine with me. I can do it either day.

153
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
That would be very helpful.

154
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,600
I think the building just needs a good cleaning.

155
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
And a good paint job.

156
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Then we have to furnish it.

157
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,600
I wish Robbie and Alexandra had come to this meeting.

158
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,600
They had some ideas about getting the place fixed up.

159
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Perhaps they'll show up. In the meantime,

160
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,600
let me give you some additional thoughts and ideas I have.

161
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
OK.

162
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Go ahead, Joanne.

163
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,600
As I said, mostly the building just needs a good cleaning.

164
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,600
This place can be developed

165
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,600
with one real intergenerational program.

166
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
That's an idea I like.

167
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
A community center

168
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,600
with the kinds of programs that fit everyone.

169
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,600
And programs that don't leave anyone out.

170
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
It's asking a lot.

171
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,600
But we can't do it without talking to the young people.

172
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Finding out what they want.

173
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
If only Robbie and Alexandra were here.

174
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Don't be upset, Malcolm.

175
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
We'll have a chance to talk to them later.

176
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
It's not like Robbie.

177
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,600
If he says he's going to be here, he's here.

178
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,600
I wonder what the problem is.

179
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Hi, everyone. Sorry I'm late.

180
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,000
But Alexandra and I

181
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
have been busy at work this morning

182
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,400
on the community-center project.

183
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,000
And we brought someone along who can help.

184
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You remember Charles Maxwell, Grandpa?

185
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
He's the editor of the Riverdale paper.

186
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He wrote some nice articles on Mom

187
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
when she was running for the school board.

188
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yes, I remember. You were a great help.

189
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Hi, Mr. Stewart.

190
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Hope to be a bigger help on the new community-center project.

191
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
From what Robbie and Alexandra have told me,

192
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
you people are making one big story.

193
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Let me introduce you, Mr. Maxwell.

194
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
This is Nat Baker,

195
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
who's responsible for this meeting,

196
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,600
and this is Joanne Thompson, and Abe Lucas,

197
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
who used to run the drugstore in town.

198
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Robbie and Alexandra told me

199
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
what you need to fix up the old library.

200
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,600
I am planning to write an editorial that I think will help you.

201
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Let's go. What are your questions?

202
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,600
OK. Now, I have ... first ... a couple of questions here.

203
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Have you talked to the community council?

204
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,600
And have you had an engineer come in to do an inspection?

205
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,600
OK, what do you need most of all?

206
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
People power.

207
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Men and women, young and old, to give us their time.

208
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
To do what?

209
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,600
To help scrub the building interior clean.

210
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
So that we can repaint it.

211
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,600
And you also need bodies to do repainting?

212
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
That's right.

213
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,600
And we'll also need some ladders

214
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
and some brushes and some paint.

215
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
When do you need the volunteers,

216
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
and where do they report?

217
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
I've got the council to agree

218
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,600
to open the building for us on the next four weekends.

219
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
How about furnishings?

220
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Are there any special requirements that I should list in the paper?

221
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Yes.

222
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Here is a copy of all the things we need to start with.

223
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Let's see. Four desks.

224
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Eight straight-back chairs. Thirty folding chairs.

225
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Six table lamps. Three end tables. One piano.

226
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
This is a good start.

227
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,600
These items shouldn't be difficult to come by

228
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
once I print the article in the paper.

229
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
This community has always been very generous.

230
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
I agree, Mr. Maxwell.

231
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,600
What you're saying is, in order for this center to succeed,

232
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
we need to put together volunteers

233
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,600
from the various generations of future users.

234
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
That's right.

235
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,600
And without their energy and stamina,

236
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
there's no way we can complete this project.

237
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,600
I've got it. Now give me some information about

238
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
how you see the building being used.

239
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Oh, here. On the ground floor we have the reception area ...

240
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,600
It's here, Robbie.

241
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Charles Maxwell lived up to his word.

242
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,600
"At the Stewart family home on Linden Street yesterday,

243
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,600
a group of caring Riverdale citizens gathered

244
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,600
to plan the refurbishing of the old library

245
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,600
to transform it into a new community center.

246
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,600
The original plan by the council

247
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,600
was tabled because of lack of funds.

248
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,600
The new plan needs you.

249
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,600
You could call it a community unity plan.

250
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,600
It needs your time, and it needs your energy.

251
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,600
And it needs your contributions of furniture,

252
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,600
paint, brushes, ladders, lamps, et cetera.

253
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,600
A list of these items and a volunteer form

254
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,600
can be picked up at the Riverdale Press offices.

255
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
By working together,

256
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,600
this community can do anything to benefit its citizens,

257
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,600
and we know you will all work together

258
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
towards refurbishing the old library

259
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,600
and making it a new community center.

260
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Charles Maxwell, Editor."
