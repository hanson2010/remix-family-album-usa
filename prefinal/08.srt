Episode 08 - You're Going to Be Fine

3
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Molly, I need your special talent for handling special matters.

4
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Like what special matters?

5
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Well, I have a scheduling problem.

6
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Yes?

7
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,600
I have three tonsillectomies set for Friday with Dr. Earl.

8
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Yes?

9
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,600
I need to fit a fourth operation into his schedule.

10
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,600
And... I know you can do it.

11
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Who's the patient?

12
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Carl Herrera.

13
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
The boy has infected tonsils,

14
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
and we should remove them as soon as possible.

15
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Well, I'll try to arrange the schedule, Dr. Stewart.

16
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
But it's not going to be easy.

17
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,600
I know you'll be able to take care of it.

18
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Well, Mrs. Herrera,

19
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Carl will be perfectly fine after we remove his tonsils.

20
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Thank you for your reassurance, Dr. Stewart.

21
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,600
He's had so many colds and sore throats recently.

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Well, it's a very easy operation, Carl.

23
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
You won't feel a thing.

24
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
But when do they do it?

25
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
This Friday.

26
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
But Saturday's my birthday.

27
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Well, we could reschedule the operation, Mrs. Herrera,

28
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
but I don't want to put it off too long.

29
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
No, I think it's important to do it now.

30
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,600
We can have a birthday party for you, Carl,

31
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
When you come out of the hospital.

32
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
But it won't be on my birthday.

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
But your health is more important, Carl. Believe me.

34
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
I don't want my tonsils out.

35
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Nurse Baker, would you come in, please?

36
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Hello, Mrs. Herrera. Hi, Carl, how you doing?

37
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,600
I don't want my tonsils out.

38
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Come with me, Carl.

39
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
You and I will talk this over.

40
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:50,600
She has a special way with kids.

41
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
She sure does.

42
00:03:51,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Carl, does your throat hurt?

43
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Yes.

44
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
OK. Do you want to get better?

45
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Yes.

46
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
OK. We want you to get better, too.

47
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
You'll have your tonsils out tomorrow,

48
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,600
and you won't get so many colds anymore.

49
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
But if I have my tonsils out tomorrow,

50
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
I'll miss my birthday party on Saturday.

51
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
I know.

52
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
It's a problem, isn't it?

53
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Let me try to work something out.

54
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
What?

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
I have to think about it.

56
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
You're fooling me.

57
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Oh, I'm not, Carl.

58
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Give me a chance to think about it,

59
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
and I'll come up with something.

60
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
A surprise?

61
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Maybe.

62
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
But you just put on your pajamas and robe,

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
and I'll think of a surprise.

64
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Will it hurt?

65
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
No.

66
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
There are other boys and girls here,

67
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
and they're having their tonsils out.

68
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
You'll meet them.

69
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
I don't want to.

70
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Change your clothes, Carl.

71
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Everything will be just fine.

72
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,600
OK.

73
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Do you know how to play charades?

74
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Frank, you've never played charades?

75
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Nope.

76
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Carl, you're sure you've never played?

77
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,600
OK, Betty, Tim, and Frank.

78
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
We're going to play charades.

79
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Frank, you can learn as we go.

80
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
And, Carl, you join in at any time.

81
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,600
OK, let me think.

82
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,600
OK, I've got one.

83
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:48,600
All right.

84
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,600
A movie!

85
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
A movie!

86
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Right.

87
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
A movie.

88
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
OK.

89
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Six words.

90
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
It has six words.

91
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
That's easy.

92
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
I can play.

93
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Good. OK.

94
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
We've got a movie.

95
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
The title...

96
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Six words.

97
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Right.

98
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
First word ...

99
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Sounds like.

100
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Sounds like ...

101
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
You got that part right.

102
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Yes.

103
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Sounds like ...

104
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Sounds like what?

105
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Sounds like no.

106
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Absolutely right, Frank.

107
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Sounds like no.

108
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
OK.

109
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
We've got a movie.

110
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Six words.

111
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
The first word sounds like no.

112
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Row. Row.

113
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Go. Go

114
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Nope.

115
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Show.

116
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
That's it - show.

117
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
No... OK...

118
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Snow.

119
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Absolutely right, Betty.

120
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Sounds like no - snow.

121
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
OK, a movie. Six words.

122
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
The first word is snow.

123
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
This is fun.

124
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Oh, OK.

125
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,600
The fifth word.

126
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Right, fifth word.

127
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Seven?

128
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Absolutely right.

129
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Very good.

130
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
The fifth word is seven.

131
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
OK, we've got a movie.

132
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
The first word is snow.

133
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Fifth word, seven.

134
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
I got it!

135
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
I got it!

136
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

137
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,600
I got it.

138
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
I got it.

139
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Frank, you got it.

140
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Betty, you had it, but you didn't say it.

141
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
I knew it.

142
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Carl, now you know charades.

143
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Why don't you join us?

144
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
I don't like charades.

145
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
It's for babies.

146
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Oh, I like it.

147
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Well, they're babies.

148
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
You're a sore loser.

149
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Yeah.

150
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
No arguing.

151
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Save your voices.

152
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Between now and tomorrow

153
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
you're all going to have your tonsils out.

154
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
And you won't be able to speak for a while.

155
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
So save your voices till then.

156
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Hi, gang. Hi, everybody.

157
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Well, what's going on?

158
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I sure I am glad to see you, Dr. Stewart.

159
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
This is a rough group.

160
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,600
I didn't want to play charades,

161
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
so they're angry at me.

162
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Why don't you want to play?

163
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Because I don't want to be here.

164
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I don't want my tonsils out.

165
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Why not?

166
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Because my birthday is tomorrow.

167
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
My mother promised me a birthday party with a clown.

168
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
But you can have one when you go home, Carl.

169
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,600
But my birthday is tomorrow.

170
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
I'm sorry, Carl.

171
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Carl, you'll have your party when you go home,

172
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
But it won't be on my birthday!

173
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,600
And you promised me a surprise.

174
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,600
It hurts, doesn't it?

175
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,600
You'll feel better tomorrow, Betty, believe me.

176
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Only one day, and it won't hurt as much.

177
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Do you feel like eating?

178
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Having some dinner?

179
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Oh, don't look so sad.

180
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Let me tell you about your dinner.

181
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
It's ice cream.

182
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Ice cream.

183
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
All kinds of flavors.

184
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Chocolate.

185
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Strawberry?

186
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Vanilla?

187
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Vanilla, too?

188
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,600
I see you're feeling better already, Betty.

189
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
So you will have dinner?

190
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,600
OK, honey, we'll see to it

191
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,600
that you have strawberry and vanilla ice cream.

192
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Just rest now.

193
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
You need some rest to help you get better quickly.

194
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Hi, Frank.

195
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,600
How you doing?

196
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Oh, come on now.

197
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
You're a big boy.

198
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
It doesn't hurt that much, does it?

199
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Oh, I'm sorry it hurts so much,

200
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
and you won't be able to have dinner.

201
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
You're just going to have to have ice cream.

202
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Yes, ice cream.

203
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Lots of flavors.

204
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Want to hear them?

205
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Chocolate?

206
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Then chocolate it is.

207
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
One scoop or two?

208
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Three scoops?

209
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Then three it will be.

210
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:15,600
You want three scoops also?

211
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Chocolate, too?

212
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Well, I see you're feeling better.

213
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Well, at least you're acting like you feel better.

214
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Three scoops of chocolate ice cream for Tim coming up.

215
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Hi, Carl.

216
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
How you doing?

217
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,600
I know it hurts.

218
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
But it'll be better tomorrow.

219
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
In the meantime, what would you like?

220
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Surprise.

221
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
A surprise?

222
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,600
I promised you a surprise, didn't I?

223
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
And it wasn't just ice cream, was it?

224
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Your birthday is tomorrow, isn't it?

225
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Well, maybe, just maybe,

226
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
there will be a surprise.

227
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,600
But first you have to smile.

228
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,600
I just want to see one smile from you.

229
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,600
No smile, no surprise.

230
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,600
That's the deal.

231
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
No smile, no surprise.

232
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
If you want a surprise,

233
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
then you've got to smile first.

234
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:48,600
How are you all doing?

235
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Well, I'm glad you're feeling better

236
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,600
because we have a little surprise for you today.

237
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
It's Carl's birthday,

238
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,600
and we have Popo the Clown to entertain you.

239
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
And here he is - Popo the Clown.

240
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Happy birthday, Carl.
Happy birthday.

241
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
All right, everybody.

242
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
OK, Carl.

243
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
It's your birthday.

244
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
What's your wish?

245
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
What would you like?

246
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Hmm?

247
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,600
You want to play charades?
