Episode 09 - It's Up to You

3
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Who is it?

4
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Dad.

5
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Come on in, Dad.

6
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,600
I thought you might be hungry.

7
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,600
I brought you a chicken sandwich and a glass of milk.

8
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
I am hungry.

9
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Thanks, Dad.

10
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,600
What time is it, anyway?

11
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Ten o'clock.

12
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,600
What are you working on?

13
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
I'm writing a story for the high-school paper.

14
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Can't you finish it tomorrow?

15
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,600
No, I have to turn it in in the morning.

16
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
What's it about?

17
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,600
I'm writing an article on the feelings about graduation.

18
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,600
And ... how do you feel?

19
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Me?

20
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
A little scared.

21
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
And excited, too.

22
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,600
I felt the same way.

23
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
The scary part's leaving home and moving to college.

24
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Oh, leaving home is part of growing up.

25
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Well, don't work all night.

26
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
I don't mind.

27
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
I enjoy writing.

28
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Well,

29
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
maybe you should think about becoming a writer.

30
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Maybe I should.

31
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,600
You have lots of time to decide.

32
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
That's the worst part--making decisions.

33
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,600
You'll be OK.

34
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Good night, Son.

35
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Good night, Dad.

36
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:42,600
"Hail to the victors valiant,

37
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Hail to the conquering heroes,

38
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Hail, Hail to Michigan,

39
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
The champions of the West!"

40
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Ah, good morning, Robbie.

41
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Good morning, Dad.

42
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
How's my grandson?

43
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Fine, Grandpa. Fine!

44
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
What's all the cheering about?

45
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Did the University of Michigan win another football game?

46
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Better than that.

47
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Tell him, Philip.

48
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
I just spoke with Charley Rafer.

49
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Who's Charley Rafer?

50
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,600
He's the Dean of Admissions for the University of Michigan.

51
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,600
And it turns out he's a classmate of Philip's.

52
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
We were both on the tennis team.

53
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Great!

54
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
It is great.

55
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
He's going to be in New York tomorrow

56
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
to interview applicants for admission.

57
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,600
And he's agreed to fit you into his schedule.

58
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
But I may not want to go to Michigan.

59
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
It's one of the best schools in the country, Robbie.

60
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
I studied medicine there.

61
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Your grandfather went to the Engineering School there.

62
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
I know that, but...

63
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,600
You said you wanted to be a doctor like your father.

64
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Not exactly.

65
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,600
You couldn't pick a finer medical school than Michigan.

66
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Yes, I know that.

67
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Let's meet with Charley at the university club.

68
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

69
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
It doesn't mean you're going to Michigan.

70
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
It doesn't mean you have to be a doctor.

71
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,600
But the interview will be good experience for you.

72
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
In that case, it's OK.

73
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Dad, growing up means

74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
making my own decisions, doesn't it?

75
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
You're right, Robbie.

76
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,600
But, like your Grandpa suggested,

77
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,600
have the interview.

78
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
And then make your own decision.

79
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
That sounds fine.

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
I know it's sudden, Robbie,

81
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
but this is an important opportunity.

82
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
We'll head down there first thing tomorrow morning.

83
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
OK?

84
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Sure, Dad.

85
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
I want you to know something, Son.

86
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,600
I'm ... very proud of you.

87
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Thanks, Dad.

88
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Well, I've got an appointment at the hospital.

89
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
I'll see you all at dinnertime.

90
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Bye, Dad.

91
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Is something still wrong, Robbie?

92
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,600
I'll be OK.

93
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Going away to college for the first time

94
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,600
always makes one a little nervous.

95
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
I guess so.

96
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,600
I'll be OK. I just need time to think.

97
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Sorry, Robbie.

98
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Sorry to be late this morning,but,

99
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,600
well, we've still got some time for a cup of coffee

100
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
I can't wait to see my old pal Charley Rafer.

101
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Neither can I.

102
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:37,600
So you thought about it, huh?

103
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Yes, I have, Dad.

104
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Well, I'm glad.

105
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
I knew you'd realize

106
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
that this interview could be an important experience for you.

107
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
I came to that conclusion.

108
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
That's very wise, Robbie.

109
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Very wise.

110
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Now let's head off for the city and the university club.

111
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Thanks, Dad.

112
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Thanks... for what?

113
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Thanks for hearing me out. And ...

114
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
And...?

115
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,600
And thanks for being such an understanding father.

116
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Well, thank you, Robbie. Thank you.

117
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Philip Stewart!

118
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
It's great to see you!

119
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Charley Rafer, you look as young as ever.

120
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,600
You must be Robbie.

121
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Hi.

122
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Yes, this is my youngest son Robbie.

123
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Robbie, I want you to meet

124
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,600
one of the best tennis players on the Michigan team -

125
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Charley Rafer.

126
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Nice to meet you, Dean Rafer.

127
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Well, are you as good a tennis player as your dad?

128
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
No, I'm not very good at it.

129
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Frankly, neither was I.

130
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Charley was the star of the team.

131
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Yeah. Thanks.

132
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Well, how're you been, Philip?

133
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Oh, working too hard.

134
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Doesn't show.

135
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
How's Ellen?

136
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Fine, thank you.

137
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
And how's Marge?

138
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,600
She's still giving the toughest English history exams

139
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,600
in the school and loving every minute of it.

140
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
And speaking of minutes,

141
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
I have interviews until noon,

142
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
so why don't we get right to work?

143
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Can you have lunch with us later?

144
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
I'd love to, Philip, but I'm afraid I can't.

145
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
I'm only here two days,

146
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
and I have interviews with twenty-six applicants.

147
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
I understand.

148
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Well, thanks.

149
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
I'll wait outside.

150
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
Good luck, Son.

151
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Did you bring your transcript from high school?

152
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Yes, sir.

153
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Right here.

154
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Thank you.

155
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Please sit down.

156
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,600
I see under "activities" that

157
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
you've been writing for the school paper.

158
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Yes, sir.

159
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
What kinds of articles have you written?

160
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,600
All kinds - sports, editorials, theater reviews.

161
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
You name it, I've written it.

162
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Hmmm.

163
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Well, have you ever thought of becoming a journalist?

164
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
A professional writer?

165
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Not until recently.

166
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Michigan has a fine School of Journalism.

167
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Yes, I know that.

168
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,600
You seem to have some reservations.

169
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
I'm a little uncertain.

170
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,600
It's been very nice talking to you.

171
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Nice talking to you, sir.

172
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
One piece of advice.

173
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,600
The most important thing is for you to decide your own future.

174
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Yes, sir.

175
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Good-bye, Dean Rafer.

176
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Good-bye, Robbie.

177
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Good luck.

178
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,000
I had an interview today, too.

179
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I had a great interview

180
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,600
with Admissions at Columbia University.

181
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Really?

182
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
What did they say?

183
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Will you get into the school?

184
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Well, they didn't say anything for sure.

185
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,600
But I figure that with my grades and with my personality,

186
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
I'll have no problem.

187
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Columbia's a terrific school.

188
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
What are you going to do?

189
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Do? I don't know.

190
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
I also applied to NYU.

191
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
You sound excited about Columbia.

192
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
What's your problem, Mike?

193
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Indecision. Indecision.

194
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
It's not easy,

195
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
and this is an important decision we have to make.

196
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
What about you?

197
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
How was your interview with Michigan?

198
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
The interview was fine.

199
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
It's a great college.

200
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
It is.

201
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
My father would like me to go there.

202
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
He and my Grandpa both went there.

203
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Great medical school, too.

204
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
I know.

205
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
You can follow in your father's footsteps.

206
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Ah! I'd like to follow in my own footsteps, Mike.

207
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
What do you want to study?

208
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
I've been thinking.

209
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I think I want to study journalism

210
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,600
to be a reporter--a newspaperman.

211
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
You do a pretty good job on the Riverdale High School paper.

212
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,600
And I've been thinking about it a lot lately.

213
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Have you discussed it with your parents?

214
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,600
No. But I have to.

215
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
OK. Let's talk.

216
00:16:50,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Hi, Son. Is everything all right?

217
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Hi, Dad. Everything's fine.

218
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,600
I was just waiting for you to get home

219
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
so we could talk.

220
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Anything special you want to talk about?

221
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,600
There is, Dad.

222
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
I'm listening.

223
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Well, I know you and Mom have given up a lot

224
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,600
to save money for my college tuition.

225
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,600
We want you to go to college, Robbie.

226
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
I know. I do.

227
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,600
But?

228
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,600
Well, I've thought a lot about which college,

229
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,600
and one of them is Columbia.

230
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Columbia? Why Columbia?

231
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,600
First, they have an excellent School of Journalism.

232
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,600
They do.

233
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,600
And your friends are planning to go to Columbia?

234
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
That's only part of it.

235
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
It's complicated.

236
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,600
I'll try to explain.

237
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Mike and I had a hamburger this afternoon, and we talked.

238
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Yes?

239
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Well, we talked about a lot of things.

240
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
He applied to Columbia,

241
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
and his interview was very successful.

242
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
He thinks he'll be accepted,

243
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
and he really wants to go there.

244
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Dean Rafer called me today.

245
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,600
He told me he was very impressed with you.

246
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
He's a nice man.

247
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
He was very kind.

248
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,600
He told me

249
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,600
you had some doubts about wanting to go to Michigan.

250
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Yes. I do.

251
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,600
I'm just not sure about what I want to do.

252
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
That's OK.

253
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,600
You understand?

254
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
Let me tell you something, Robbie.

255
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Something that might be surprising to you.

256
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
What? Tell me.

257
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Well, Grandpa wanted me to study engineering, like him.

258
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Well, I wasn't clear about my future,

259
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,600
but I knew engineering was not for me.

260
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,600
What did you tell Grandpa?

261
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
The truth.

262
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Then you're not upset

263
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
about my not wanting to go into medicine?

264
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,600
I'm not upset at all.

265
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,600
I'm just happy that we're able to talk about it.

266
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I am too, Dad.

267
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,600
I suppose you want to apply to Columbia.

268
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Yes, but I also want to apply to several other colleges.

269
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,600
I thought you wanted to go to Columbia.

270
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Well, I might want to go to Columbia.

271
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
But I might not.

272
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,600
I just want to be able to make my own decision.

273
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,600
You're a real Stewart!

274
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,600
And if I think about it long enough, you never know...

275
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Never know what?

276
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
If I make my own decision,

277
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,600
I might choose Michigan.

278
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Robbie, you're something!

279
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,600
You know, when I was your age,

280
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,600
I said exactly the same thing to Grandpa.
