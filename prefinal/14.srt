Episode 14 - Playing Games

3
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,600
You like living in New York, don't you?

4
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Oh, I love it.

5
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
It's so convenient.

6
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
I can take the bus to work...

7
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
or the subway...

8
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
or a taxi.

9
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
And there's so much to do.

10
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Lots of movie houses, and the theater.

11
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
I know what you mean.

12
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
I'd like to live in the city,

13
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
but living in New Jersey and the suburbs

14
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
is better for Michelle.

15
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Trees, grass.

16
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,600
There's a lot of good things about suburban living.

17
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
I grew up in Riverdale, remember?

18
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
So I know.

19
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
But, as a working woman,

20
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,600
I think New York has all the conveniences,

21
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
including the best tomatoes.

22
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,600
The truth is, I'd like to live in the city.

23
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Michelle's the right age. Michelle

24
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
There are lots of things for her here.

25
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
You're right, Harry.

26
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Today is the perfect example.

27
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Michelle and her friends are at the aquarium in Brooklyn.

28
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
They come back here for lunch,

29
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,600
then go uptown to the Museum of Natural History.

30
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
There's so much for young people to see and do.

31
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
It's just incredible!

32
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Not just for young people.

33
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
What about me?

34
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I've never been to the aquarium

35
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
or the Museum of Natural History. Have you?

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Oh yes, Harry.

37
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
My mother and father

38
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
often took us somewhere in the city on the weekends.

39
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Dad was a busy doctor,

40
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
but he usually managed to squeeze a Sunday in

41
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
with Richard, Robbie, and me.

42
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,600
I used to love to go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

43
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
I've been there several times.

44
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Twice with Michelle.

45
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,600
You ought to think about spending more time with Michelle

46
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
at all the great places in the city.

47
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Well, perhaps,

48
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
you'll help me select some of the great places.

49
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
And perhaps, you'll join us?

50
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Perhaps I will.

51
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Well, there we are.

52
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
All set for lunch, Harry.

53
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
It looks inviting.

54
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
I wish Michelle and her friends would get here.

55
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I'm starving, aren't you?

56
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
I can't wait to take a bite of the pumpernickel.

57
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
It smells so delicious.

58
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Coming! Coming!

59
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Who is it?

60
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Michelle.

61
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
It's us, Susan.

62
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Come in, Michelle,

63
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
and bring your friends along.

64
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
We're on the fifth floor.

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Oh, you've been here before.

66
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Susan,

67
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,600
I really appreciate

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
your doing this for Michelle and her friends.

69
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Oh, please, Harry.

70
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
It's nothing.

71
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
I'm not just doing it for Michelle.

72
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
I'm doing it for you.

73
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Thank you.

74
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,600
I'm doing it for us, Harry.

75
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Well,

76
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
it's... it's important for Michelle to see us together more often.

77
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
That's true.

78
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,600
It's important

79
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
for Michelle and me to get to know each other better.

80
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,600
That's important for us.

81
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,600
That makes me feel good.

82
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
What, Harry?

83
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
What makes you feel good?

84
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Well, that you care about Michelle,

85
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
that you care about me, and

86
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
that you care about us.

87
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Well, Harry, that's because I do.

88
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
I do care.

89
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,600
They'll be here any minute.

90
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Susan, I'd like to continue this conversation later.

91
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Of course, Harry.

92
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,600
We'll finish the conversation when they go to the museum.

93
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
I'd like that.

94
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
So would I.

95
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Oh, Daddy!

96
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
We had such a good time at the aquarium.

97
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
I saw a real shark.

98
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
I could almost touch it.

99
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
I'm so glad.

100
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Hi. Michelle,

101
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
why don't you introduce everybody to Susan?

102
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Hi, Susan.

103
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,600
I'd like you to meet Audrey and her mother, Mrs. Cooper.

104
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Hello, Audrey.

105
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Cooper.

106
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
I'm Susan Stewart.

107
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
And this is Shirley and Nicole.

108
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Hi, girls.

109
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Come on in.

110
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Come on in, Mrs. Cooper.

111
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Come on in, everybody.

112
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
The aquarium was so exciting.

113
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I had never been there before.

114
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
The girls learned a great deal.

115
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Frankly, so did I.

116
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Well, please sit down

117
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
and tell us all about it during lunch.

118
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
We prepared some tuna fish

119
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
and cheese sandwiches for lunch.

120
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,600
I love tuna fish.

121
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Don't you, Audrey?

122
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,600
I remember when I used to be a Girl Scout.

123
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
My mother would take us everywhere, too.

124
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Susan, I understand you're in the toy business.

125
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Yes, I am.

126
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,600
My company manufactures toys and games for children.

127
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Susan's vice-president in charge of new toys and games.

128
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
And the marketing of new toys and games.

129
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Can we test a new game for you, Susan?

130
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
That's an excellent idea, Michelle.

131
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
I happen to have

132
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
a game which I brought home to study.

133
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Let us try it!

134
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
Do you want to play?

135
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Nicole? Shirley? Audrey?

136
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,600
We tested it last week on twelve- to fifteen-year-olds,

137
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,600
and they found it to be too easy

138
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
in other words... boring.

139
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,600
We think it might be just right for ten- to twelve-year-olds.

140
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
That's us, Susan.

141
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
First, you shuffle the deck

142
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,600
and lay them face down.

143
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Then you select the leader.

144
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
I'll be the leader.

145
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,600
The leader takes the first ten cards

146
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
and lays them face up on this stand.

147
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:57,600
h-t-e-r-c-z-e-p-e-s.

148
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Everyone gets a turn, going counterclockwise,

149
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
left to right.

150
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,600
You have thirty seconds to make a word,

151
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
using as many letters as possible.

152
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,600
You get one point for each letter,

153
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,600
plus the person with the longest word gets ten extra points.

154
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,600
The first one to get one hundred points wins.

155
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
That's easy.

156
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
OK, let's go around the table.

157
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
You first, Audrey.

158
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Chest - c-h-e-s-t.

159
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Good.

160
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
That's five points.

161
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Next, Nicole.

162
00:10:48,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Three - t-h-r-e-e.

163
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
OK.

164
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
That's five points also.

165
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
It's your turn, Shirley.

166
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Creep - c-r-e-e-p.

167
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Creep.

168
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
That's another five-letter word.

169
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Five points.

170
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
So far, you're all tied.

171
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Sheet - s-h-e-e-t.

172
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Sheet is a five-letter word.

173
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Michelle, your turn.

174
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Cheese - c-h-e-e-s-e.

175
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Terrific!

176
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Michelle wins with a six-letter word,

177
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,600
plus she gets an additional ten points

178
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
for a total of sixteen points.

179
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
How are you enjoying the game so far?

180
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
I think it's too easy.

181
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Too easy?

182
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Michelle!

183
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
It's OK, Harry.

184
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Michelle is quite right.

185
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
She just said it's too easy.

186
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Well, I like the game.

187
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
I enjoyed lunch, Susan.

188
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Thank you so much,

189
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
but we have to get going

190
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
to meet the rest of the troop at two o'clock at the museum.

191
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Oh, it was nice meeting all of you.

192
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,600
I hope you have a wonderful time

193
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
at the Museum of Natural History.

194
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Good-bye, everybody.

195
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Have a good time.

196
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Bye.

197
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
See you in front of the museum at five o'clock.

198
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Oh, OK.

199
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Thanks, Mr. Bennett.

200
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
That'll be fine.

201
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
And thanks again for the lunch and for the game.

202
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Good-bye, Susan.

203
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
It's not a bad game.

204
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
It's just ... slow.

205
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Just slow.

206
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,600
You helped save our company a lot of money.

207
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Bye-bye.

208
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:48,600
You are wonderful with kids.

209
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,600
I am.

210
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Isn't there a conversation that we have to finish?

211
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,600
There's a conversation we have to finish.

212
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
What was it about?

213
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
It was about caring.

214
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Oh?

215
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Yes, caring.

216
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I said that it makes me feel good

217
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
that you care about Michelle.

218
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Well, I do care about Michelle.

219
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,600
And it makes me feel good that you care about me.

220
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
You know I do.

221
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,600
You're a... wonderful friend.

222
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
And it makes me feel good

223
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
that you care about us.

224
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Well ... well,

225
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
I do, Harry.

226
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,600
It's only natural that if I care about Michelle

227
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
and I care about you,

228
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
then I care about us.

229
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
It's OK, Susan.

230
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
We had this part of the conversation

231
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
before Michelle and her friends arrived.

232
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Now comes the good part.

233
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Like what?

234
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Well, assume that if you care about Michelle

235
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
and you care about me

236
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
and you care about us,

237
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
that we can talk about us.

238
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
I mean you and me.

239
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Isn't that right?

240
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,600
What are you trying to say, Harry?

241
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,600
What I'm trying to say ...

242
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,600
since this is so easy...

243
00:17:44,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Here are ten letters that express my feelings for you.

244
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Don't be silly, Harry.

245
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,600
You want a hint?

246
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
It's two words.

247
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
You're making the game harder.

248
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Can't you figure it out?

249
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Seven letters... two words...

250
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,600
that express the feelings that I feel for you in my heart.

251
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Harry, I get it!

252
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Well? Does that mean you'll marry me?

253
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Is that a proposal, or are we just playing a game?

254
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Sit down, Susan.

255
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:08,600
There's something I have to ask you.

256
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Susan, will you marry me? Susan

257
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,600
It's such an important decision.

258
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
There's so many things to talk about.

259
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,600
There are three things that have to be done first, Harry.

260
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Three things?

261
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,600
First, we have to decide where to live.

262
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Well, that's easy.

263
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
We talked about that earlier.

264
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
We'll live in New York.

265
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
All right.

266
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Second,

267
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,600
we have to talk to Michelle together about being married.

268
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
We'll do that immediately.

269
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
What's the third thing?

270
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,600
You have to ask for my father's permission.

271
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Absolutely!

272
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
But first things first.

273
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
We have to go pick up Michelle.

274
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Oh, I'm so happy, Harry!

275
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Not as happy as I am.
