Episode 06 - Thanksgiving

3
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,600
OK, Philip. This is your third cup of coffee.

4
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
We should get to work,

5
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
or we won't be finished by dinnertime.

6
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
I guess we must.

7
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
We must.

8
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:30,600
OK. The beginning of my famous Thanksgiving apple pie.

9
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:37,600
One apple. Two apples. Three apples. Four apples.

10
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Come on, Philip!

11
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Get busy with your famous apple pie.

12
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
There's much more to be done.

13
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Now, the ingredients.

14
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,600
What goes into my apple pie besides apples?

15
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Ah, yes. Flour, sugar, butter.

16
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Butter, nice and cold and hard.

17
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
OK, here are the walnuts.

18
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Last but not least,

19
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,600
the reason my apple pie is famous - cinnamon.

20
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Cinnamon.

21
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Ellen, where's the cinnamon?

22
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
If there is any cinnamon,

23
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
it's in the cabinet with the salt and pepper.

24
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Salt, pepper, dill weed, garlic powder, cinnamon. Ellen?

25
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Yes, Philip.

26
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Is it possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon?

27
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Yes, it is possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon.

28
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Well, how can I make my famous apple pie without cinnamon?

29
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Good morning.

30
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Oh, hi, Robbie. Good morning.

31
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Good morning. Robbie.

32
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Can you do me a favor?

33
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Sure, Dad. What?

34
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Remember my apple pie on Thanksgiving?

35
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
What do you love about it?

36
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
The apples?

37
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
No. The sssss...

38
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Right. We don't have any cinnamon.

39
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
I'll go down to Henry's grocery. He's always open.

40
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
I'll get some for you.

41
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
That's my boy!

42
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Oh, put your heavy jacket on, Robbie.

43
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
It's cold outside.

44
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Alexandra might call.

45
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Tell her I'll call her right back.

46
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
OK.

47
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Thanks, Son.

48
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Uh, why does he always have to slam the door?

49
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Hello... Hello, Alexandra. How are you? Fine.

50
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Robbie just went to the store.

51
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
He'll be back soon.

52
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
He said he'll call you.

53
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Oh, oh, I see... Oh... certainly.

54
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Well, do you have the phone number there?

55
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Oh... I see... Please, I know he wants to talk to you...

56
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Thank you,

57
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,600
and happy Thanksgiving to you and your family, too.

58
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Try to come by later for dessert. Bye.

59
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,600
That was Alexandra.

60
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
She and the Molinas

61
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
are going to spend Thanksgiving with their cousins.

62
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
She doesn't have the phone number.

63
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Oh, Robbie will be disappointed.

64
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
He'll be grouchy.

65
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Maybe she'll call back. She promised.

66
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Here's your cinnamon, Pop.

67
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:09,600
It was a dollar and sixty cents.

68
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,600
You forgot to ask me for the change.

69
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Or did you forget to give it to me?

70
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Thanks, Son.

71
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Alexandra called.

72
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
I'll call her back.

73
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
She said she'll call you later.

74
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
She's not at home.

75
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:48,600
You should have your breakfast, Son.

76
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Make you feel better.

77
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Protein, vitamins.

78
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
She said she'll call back?

79
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Yes, she did.

80
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,600
Good morning, everyone!

81
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Happy Turkey Day!

82
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,600
What's wrong?

83
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

84
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,600
What's gotten into him?

85
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
He missed a phone call.

86
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
From...?

87
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Yes, Alexandra.

88
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:21,600
It's nice to see young love... Oh, to be young again!

89
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Where's the coffee?

90
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,600
I love parades.

91
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,600
The Thanksgiving Day parade is always such great fun.

92
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Look at that Superman balloon!

93
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Wowee! Just floating along high above Central Park West.

94
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Don't you just love it?

95
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Oh, and the bands and the music.

96
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
John Philip Sousa.

97
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
I love his music.

98
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Da dada da da dada da da da da da da dada.

99
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Oh, look at that float, Robbie.

100
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Look at those funny-looking clowns.

101
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
It's for kids.

102
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Maybe so, but parades always make me feel like a kid.

103
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Remember when you and your dad and I

104
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
went to the Thanksgiving Day parade?

105
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,600
You were four or five years old, I think.

106
00:10:50,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Hello, hello... Oh, hi, Susan.

107
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,600
How are you? Here's Mom.

108
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Hello, Susan.

109
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Yes, he missed a phone call from Alexandra.

110
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Yes, I know, but he'll get over it.

111
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Good. Then you'll be here about five?

112
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Oh, fine.

113
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,600
I look forward to seeing you and Harry and Michelle.

114
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Drive carefully.

115
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Good-bye.

116
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Taste Ellen's turkey dressing.

117
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
It's delicious.

118
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
I'm not surprised.

119
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
It's Grandma's recipe.

120
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
It's my favorite part of the meal.

121
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
What about my famous apple pie?

122
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Dad, your apple pie is my favorite dessert.

123
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
How's the parade?

124
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
OK.

125
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Mom! Is it for me?

126
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
No, Robbie.

127
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Who was it?

128
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Wrong number.

129
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Philip, would you join me in the kitchen, please?

130
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
It's getting late.

131
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
We have vegetables to prepare.

132
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Can I help with anything?

133
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
No, honey.

134
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
You just relax with Grandpa.

135
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
I'll get you to help serve later.

136
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Ellen reminds me so much of Grandma.

137
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
What time does the Michigan football game come on?

138
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Four.

139
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Philip!

140
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
I'll be back to see the game.

141
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Grandpa, when did Dad graduate from Michigan?

142
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Let me think.

143
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,600
He graduated from medical school in 1960

144
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
and from the University of Michigan in 1956.

145
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Did you go to Michigan, too, Grandpa?

146
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Yup. I graduated in 1937.

147
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:52,600
I've got to start thinking about college soon.

148
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:45,600
OK, everybody.

149
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,600
I want to welcome Harry and his daughter Michelle

150
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
to Thanksgiving with us.

151
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Thank you, Dr. Stewart.

152
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Call me Philip.

153
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
OK.

154
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
But first, I think we should take a moment

155
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
and remember the meaning of Thanksgiving.

156
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Philip, I took Michelle to a school play Philip

157
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
about the first Thanksgiving.

158
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Well, why don't you tell us about that, Michelle?

159
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Thanksgiving was about the Pilgrims,

160
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
the first settlers in America.

161
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
They shared the first harvest with the Indians

162
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
and gave thanks.

163
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
All right.

164
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Then in that spirit let each of us give thanks.

165
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Each in his own way.

166
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Who wants to begin?

167
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
I will.

168
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,600
I give thanks for being here with my family and for being well,

169
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
so I can enjoy you all.

170
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
All right!

171
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
We love you, Grandpa.

172
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:40,600
I'd like to give thanks for a healthy year, a good job,

173
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,600
and for meeting Harry and Michelle.

174
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
We'd like to give thanks for meeting Susan

175
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
and the Stewart family.

176
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
I love you, Daddy.

177
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Thanks, Harry.

178
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
That was very kind of you.

179
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,600
I'd like to give thanks for Grandpa coming to live with us.

180
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,600
And I'd also like to thank my math teacher

181
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
for giving me a passing grade.

182
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,600
And call me, Alexandra.

183
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Oh, Robbie!

184
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
She'll call.

185
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
You go first, Marilyn.

186
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
I'm thinking.

187
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
You go first.

188
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:17,600
Well, you all know I'm working on my photo album.

189
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
It's not finished yet.

190
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,600
And I'd like to thank Marilyn for being so patient.

191
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Thanks, Richard.

192
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
I should thank you for encouraging me

193
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
to keep working on my fashion designs.

194
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,600
I'm lucky to have a husband with an artistic eye.

195
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Oh, we have a lot to be thankful for.

196
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,600
For the food on this table.

197
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Just like the Pilgrims.

198
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
I'll go along with that, Ellen.

199
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Well, help me serve, Robbie.

200
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,600
It was a wonderful meal, Mrs. Stewart.

201
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Thank you.

202
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
And now to see the end of the football game.

203
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Exactly.

204
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Where are you going, Philip?

205
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Remember, the Michigan football game?

206
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
And Michigan needs a touchdown.

207
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Did you forget something?

208
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Dad, your famous apple pie.

209
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Just let me see the score, Ellen.

210
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Go ahead, Philip.

211
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
We should all take a little break before dessert.

212
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Oh, who could that be?

213
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Oh, it must be Alexandra.

214
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
I invited her to come by for dessert.

215
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
You did?

216
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
I like Ellen.

217
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
You know everyone, Alexandra.

218
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,600
No, she doesn't know Harry Bennett and his daughter Michelle.

219
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Nice to meet you.

220
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Hi.

221
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Hi.

222
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Hello, Alexandra.

223
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Hi, Marilyn.

224
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,000
Hi, Susan.

225
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,600
Happy Thanksgiving.

226
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,600
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie.

227
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Please sit down, Alexandra.

228
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Dad, Richard, Alexandra's here.

229
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Michigan needs a touchdown.

230
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Three minutes to play.

231
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Hi, Alexandra. Welcome.

232
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Hello, Alexandra.

233
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Yes, Michigan needs a touchdown.

234
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,600
One tiny little touchdown, with just three minutes to play.

235
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
You want Michigan to win.

236
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
How'd you guess?

237
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,600
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie.

238
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:25,600
What happened?

239
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,600
We forgot to turn the oven on.

240
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,600
We did?

241
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Philip, why don't you go

242
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
watch the last three minutes of the game.

243
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I will serve coffee and pumpkin pie.

244
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
OK. I'll be back in a few minutes.

245
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Robbie, would you bring the dessert plates.

246
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
And, Marilyn, would you pour coffee, please.

247
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Sure, Ellen.

248
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,600
How was your Thanksgiving dinner, Alexandra?

249
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Just wonderful, Mr. Stewart.

250
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,600
The Molinas are a large family.

251
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,601
I love being with them.

252
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,602
I'm glad you came by, Alexandra.

253
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,603
I am, too.

254
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:11,604
Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!

255
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,605
Great Thanksgiving.

256
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,606
Lots to be thankful for.

257
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,607
Michigan scored a touchdown.

258
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,608
Alexandra came by.

259
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,609
And nobody misses Philip's famous apple pie.

260
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,610
Oh, Grandpa!
