Episode 24 - Parting Friends

3
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Hi, Mom.

4
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Hi, Robbie.

5
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
You're home from school early.

6
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Yeah, they're getting the assembly hall

7
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
ready for the graduation ceremony,

8
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
so we all got to go home early.

9
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Too noisy to study.

10
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Well, now that you're here,

11
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
you can help me with dinner.

12
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I need those potatoes peeled and sliced.

13
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Mom, give me a break.

14
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Alexandra's coming over to help me study for my math final

15
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Well, in that case,

16
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
you can wash the dishes and clean up after dinner.

17
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Can I invite Alexandra to stay for dinner?

18
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Of course.

19
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Thanks, Mom.

20
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,600
You and Alexandra

21
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
have become good friends, haven't you?

22
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Yes. I like her.

23
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
She's a terrific person.

24
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I'm going to miss her

25
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
when she goes back to Greece.

26
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Would you like to give her a little farewell party?

27
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Mom, that would be terrific!

28
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Maybe we could make it a surprise.

29
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Oh, I don't know.

30
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Surprise parties don't always work out.

31
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Well, we could tell her

32
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
it's a graduation party for me.

33
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
When Alexandra arrives,

34
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
we'll surprise her.

35
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Well, I suppose that might work.

36
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,600
I'd like to give her a nice going-away present.

37
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Fine.

38
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
There's only one problem.

39
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
What's that?

40
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I'm broke.

41
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
I should have saved some money.

42
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
I'm sure Alexandra

43
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
would be happy with something simple, Robbie.

44
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
I know.

45
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
But, well,

46
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
I'd like to give her something nice

47
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
to remember me by.

48
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Maybe I could borrow some money from you and Dad.

49
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
It's all right with me

50
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
if it's all right with your dad.

51
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Thanks, Mom.

52
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
I'll talk to him.

53
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Is he still in his office?

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
I think so.

55
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Thanks, Mom.

56
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Robbie! Good luck! Robbie

57
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Here are the X-rays you wanted, Dr. Stewart.

58
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Oh. Thank you, Molly.

59
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Now, let me check them.

60
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
What do you think?

61
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
I don't see any breaks or fractures.

62
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Well, well. Thank you, Molly.

63
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Thank you.

64
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Come in!

65
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Hi, Son.

66
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Hi, Dad. Am I interrupting you?

67
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
No, no, no, no.

68
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
What's up?

69
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Can we talk?

70
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Sure.

71
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
I need some help.

72
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Well, that's what fathers are for.

73
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Well, before I go to college,

74
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
I have the whole summer ...

75
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Yes ...

76
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,500
And I'm planning to get a job for the summer.

77
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
And what sort of job?

78
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
I applied for a job as a lifeguard at the community pool.

79
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Sounds pretty good.

80
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Yes. I'll be earning pretty good money if I get it.

81
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
But right now, I'm kind of short of cash.

82
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Who isn't?

83
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,600
And my friend Alexandra is going back to Greece ...

84
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Nice girl.

85
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
We'll all miss her.

86
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Mom says we can give her a going-away surprise party.

87
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Good idea.

88
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,600
And I'd like to get her a nice gift ...

89
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
What'd you have in mind?

90
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,200
Well, a wristwatch,

91
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,600
so she'll think of me when she looks at the time.

92
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Nothing flashy or expensive.

93
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Something simple--but a good one.

94
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Sounds fine, Robbie.

95
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Well, I saw a nice watch.

96
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
But I'll need a loan.

97
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
If you could lend me the money,

98
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,600
I could pay you back out of my lifeguard salary.

99
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Well, I guess your mother and I can manage it.

100
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,600
When do you need the money?

101
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Would tomorrow be OK?

102
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,600
You've got it.

103
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Thanks, Dad.

104
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
My pleasure, Son.

105
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Oh, and, Robbie ...

106
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Yes?

107
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,600
You'll probably want the family car

108
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,600
so you can drive her home after the party.

109
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Could I?

110
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:19,400
If you drive carefully.

111
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,600
I will. Thanks, Dad.

112
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,600
My pleasure.

113
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
You're OK, Dad.

114
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,600
You're not so bad yourself, Son.

115
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,600
You ready for the next problem?

116
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
You know what?

117
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
I can't look at another number.

118
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
How about a lemonade break?

119
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Sure.

120
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Oh, by the way,

121
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,600
when is your plane reservation for your flight to Athens?

122
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Sunday. Why?

123
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Would you be able to come over Saturday night?

124
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Yes.

125
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
I should be finished packing by then.

126
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,600
My folks are giving me a little graduation party.

127
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Terrific!

128
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,600
I'll pick you up.

129
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
That isn't necessary.

130
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
My dad's letting me borrow the car.

131
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Oh, well, that would be very nice.

132
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
About eight o'clock?

133
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Eight o'clock is fine.

134
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Great! It's a date.

135
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Who's going to be there?

136
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Just my friend Mike and a few kids from school.

137
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,600
I'm going to miss all of you.

138
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
You've been like a second family to me.

139
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
We're going to miss you.

140
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Maybe you could come to visit me in Greece?

141
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
I'm counting on it.

142
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Wonderful!

143
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Are you excited about graduating from high school?

144
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Sure... and a little scared.

145
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Scared? Why?

146
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Aren't you a little scared?

147
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,600
I was when I first came to the United States.

148
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
I'd never been away from home,

149
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,600
and I didn't know what it would be like.

150
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,600
But then I found out that people are the same everywhere

151
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
once you get to know them.

152
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
I'm glad I got to know you.

153
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Thank you.

154
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,600
I'm glad I got to know you, and your family.

155
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Wouldn't it be nice if we could skip the examinations

156
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
and get right to the graduation party?

157
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
It would be very nice.

158
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,600
But that isn't the way it works.

159
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
So... back to work.

160
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Good night, Robbie.

161
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Good night, Mrs. Stewart.

162
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Thank you for dinner.

163
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Good night, Alexandra.

164
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Will you be all right?

165
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Yes. The Molinas are waiting for me.

166
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Good night, Alexandra.

167
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,600
I'll pick you up on Saturday night, OK?

168
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Yes.

169
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,600
I have to run.

170
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Good night, Robbie.

171
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:25,600
She's really a good friend, isn't she?

172
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Yeah.

173
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,600
You are going to miss her.

174
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Am I going to miss her?

175
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
That's what I said!

176
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
You are going to miss her!

177
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,600
I'm going to miss her,

178
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,600
and my math teacher's going to miss her.

179
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Well, you can write to her.

180
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
It's not the same.

181
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
How does that look, Rob?

182
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Great! Pass me the hammer.

183
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
You got it!

184
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,600
You're sure Alexandra's going to be surprised?

185
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Absolutely.

186
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,600
She has no idea that the party is in her honor.

187
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Millie, did you bring the tapes for dancing?

188
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
They're in my bag.

189
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
What did you bring?

190
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Some rock 'n' roll.

191
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Perfect! Alexandra will love it!

192
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,600
I can't wait to see her face when she walks in here tonight.

193
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
What about the cake?

194
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
My mom's decorating it right now.

195
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Robbie, there's a phone call for you.

196
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
It's Alexandra.

197
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
She sounds upset.

198
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
OK.

199
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
I'll take it in there.

200
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:48,600
Hi, Alexandra.

201
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,600
What? You what?

202
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Oh no!

203
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
How about some music?

204
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,600
No, let's wait till Robbie gets back from the airport.

205
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Did she say why she had to leave today?

206
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
She told Robbie that her flight tomorrow was canceled,

207
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
so she had to take an earlier flight today.

208
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
This is terrible.

209
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Well, that must be him.

210
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Why is he blowing his horn like that?

211
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
I don't know.

212
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Maybe he's angry.

213
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Do you think we should take down the decorations?

214
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
They'll just make him sad.

215
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Too late now.

216
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
We should have done it sooner.

217
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Oh, here he comes.

218
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Hi.

219
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
How'd it go?

220
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,600
OK, I guess.

221
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Especially when Alexandra gave me a surprise...

222
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Yeah? What was it?

223
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
This!

224
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Alexandra!

225
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Hi! What happened?

226
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,600
I called my parents from the airport.

227
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
When I told them

228
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
my friends were giving me a party,

229
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
they insisted that I stay.

230
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,600
So now I'm taking a flight on Monday instead.

231
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
That's great! Terrific!

232
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
But how did you know the party was for you?

233
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Well, Robbie told me when he gave me this.

234
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Oh, it's so pretty!

235
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
It's lovely, Robbie.

236
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
All right!

237
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Now we can really start the party!

238
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
No. Would you mind?

239
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
I'd like to say something first.

240
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Hear, hear!

241
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,600
I would just like to thank all of you,

242
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
my friends,

243
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,600
who have made my stay in the United States so wonderful.

244
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,600
And to Robbie and the Stewart family

245
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
for opening their home to me.

246
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,600
We should thank you.

247
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
You're a real friend!

248
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,600
And I also have a little surprise for you, Robbie.

249
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,600
A little going-away present.

250
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Thank you.

251
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Open it, please.

252
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
I think you might be amused.

253
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,600
OK. I can't believe it!

254
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,600
I guess we were thinking the same thought.

255
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
You had it engraved!

256
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Read it, Robbie.

257
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,600
"In friendship, always. Alexandra."

258
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
I knew we thought alike,

259
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
but this is too much!

260
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Thank you.

261
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
All right!

262
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Let's have some music!

263
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Miss Pappas?

264
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Mr. Stewart...

265
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Mrs. Stewart, may I have this dance?

266
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
My pleasure, Doctor.
