Episode 04 - A Piece of Cake

3
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
I am exhausted. My new exercise class is so hard.

4
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Your new exercise class?

5
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Yeah. My new advanced exercise class.

6
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Why advanced?

7
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,600
My instructor thought that

8
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
the beginner's class was too easy for me.

9
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Too easy for you?

10
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Don't laugh. In the beginner's class,

11
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,600
they give you a chance to rest between exercises.

12
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
So?

13
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
The advanced class is nonstop.

14
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,600
I lift weights every morning for sixty minutes

15
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
without stopping.

16
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
No problem.

17
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Listen, Richard,

18
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,600
doing aerobics for an hour is a lot different than lifting weights.

19
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Yeah. Quite a bit different.

20
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
I think aerobics is easy.

21
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
I could work out in your class with no problem.

22
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,600
You think so?

23
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Oh, without a doubt.

24
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
When's the next class?

25
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock. Try it.

26
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Tomorrow morning after lifting weights,

27
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
I'll try aerobics.

28
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
It's a nap. Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.

29
00:03:44,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Aren't you going to the aerobics class this morning?

30
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Of Course. Easy. No sweat.

31
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,600
You are not going to be able to move

32
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
after this and the aerobics class.

33
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Are you kidding me?

34
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
It's going to be a piece of cake.

35
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,600
You want to bet?

36
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Yeah. What's the bet?

37
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,600
I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning

38
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
and not feel a thing!

39
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:44,600
The bet is, I win, and you cook dinner for the entire family.

40
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Or you win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

41
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
It's a bet.

42
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Ok. Call my instructor, Jack Davis, right now.

43
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
His number is 555-8842.

44
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
The advanced class starts at 10 o'clock.

45
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Well, it's 8:20 now.

46
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
It only takes eight minutes by bicycle to the aerobics class.

47
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Give him a call.

48
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Davis Aerobics Center for Good Health.

49
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Jack Davis, please.

50
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
This is Jack Davis.

51
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Hello. This is Richard Stewart.

52
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
My wife, Marilyn Stewart, is a member of your program.

53
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,600
I'd like to come to

54
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
the ten o'clock advanced class this morning.

55
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Oh, fine, fine. Be here a few minutes early.

56
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
You need to complete some forms before the class.

57
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Thanks. I'm on my way over.

58
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Good-bye.

59
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Bye-bye. It's all set. I'm going.

60
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Bye.

61
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Bye.

62
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
See you later.

63
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Good luck.

64
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Don't forget about the bet.

65
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Dinner for the entire family.

66
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
And that includes Susan.

67
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Don't you forget.

68
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,600
OK, Richard. That's terrific.

69
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Your pressure is 120 over 75, and that's fine.

70
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Now stand up, please.

71
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Good, it's 122 over 80.

72
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
You can sit down now.

73
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,600
When was your last complete physical?

74
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Six months ago.

75
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Good. Do you have any back or knee problems?

76
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Nope. I am in perfect health.

77
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
What do you do for a living, Mr. Stewart?

78
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
I'm a photographer.

79
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Interesting. What do you photograph?

80
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Everything. The American scene. People, places, events.

81
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Did you ever think of photographing an aerobics class?

82
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,600
No... I can't remember taking pictures of people exercising.

83
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,600
But don't you think it'd be a good subject?

84
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Sure.

85
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,600
I need some good photos for my advertising, Mr. Stewart.

86
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Maybe you can photogragh a class,

87
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
and I can give you and Mrs. Stewart

88
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
a month of classes ree.

89
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
When can I photograph a class?

90
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Anytime.

91
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
How about today?

92
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Terrific!

93
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Hi.

94
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Oh, hi.

95
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Oh, hi.

96
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Are we ready to go?

97
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Yeah. Yeah. Let's get in our lines.

98
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,600
We're going to take it slow first.

99
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Stretch up ... and we're going to go left first...

100
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:11,600
2, 3, 4... now switch.

101
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
OK, hold to the right.

102
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Sunrises. Stretch it out. Flat back.

103
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Bring it up... and twists... and side... 2, 3...

104
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:44,600
and left... push... push... turn... hit the floor.

105
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Take it side again... OK, and switch. Stretch it out.

106
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,600
And we're going to warm down with a tango.

107
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Left, right. Enjoy it.

108
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Richard, did you go to the Davis Aerobics class today?

109
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Yes, I went to the aerobics class today.

110
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
What is wrong with you?

111
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Nothing. I am in excellent health.

112
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,600
I have ideal blood pressure. A perfect heart.

113
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,600
In other words, I'm in wonderful condition.

114
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Richard, did you go to the aerobics class, really?

115
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
And don't forget to invite Susan for dinner.

116
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,600
And your legs don't hurt?

117
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Hurt? What do you mean?

118
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,600
What about your arms? Lift your arms up like this.

119
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,600
And they don't hurt not even a little?

120
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Nope.

121
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:13,600
You are in great condition. I can't believe it!

122
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Grandpa, Ellen, Philip, Robbie, you and me.

123
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
That's six steaks.

124
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Don't forget Susan.

125
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Seven steaks.

126
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Cooking dinner for the entire family is not so easy.

127
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,600
The shopping: the salad:

128
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,600
tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, and onions.

129
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,600
The main course: steak and potatoes.

130
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Richard, how much broccoli do I need for seven people?

131
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Marilyn, I have to tell you something.

132
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,600
At today's exercise class...

133
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Yes, Richard.

134
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Well, I didn't really exercise.

135
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
I knew it!

136
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,600
I wanted to, but Jack Davis needed a photographer.

137
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
I'm sorry, Marilyn.

138
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,600
I don't understand. Did you exercise or not?

139
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,600
No. Instead of exercising, I photographed the class.

140
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
And you didn't exercise?

141
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
No.

142
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:10,600
There's another advanced class today at four o'clock.

143
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
We'll go together.

144
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
What about the bet?

145
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Oh, the bet is still on, but you shop for the groceries.

146
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:27,600
Remember, you win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

147
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,600
You win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

148
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
Including Susan.

149
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Four o'clock at the advanced exercise class. With me.

150
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Don't forget to breathe.

151
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Skip, hop, front.

152
00:17:52,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Twist... again... OK, now... scissors.

153
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:15,600
This is fun. It's a piece of cake.

154
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Yeah. Just wait.

155
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:26,600
5, 6, 7, go right, 1, 2, back,

156
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,600
2, 3 , 1, 2, 3, pony, pony...

157
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:36,600
1, 2, 3, kick... 1, 2, 3, kick... pony.

158
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:42,600
And twist, twist.

159
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
OK. Let's pick up the pace.

160
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
How are you doing, Richard?

161
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
I can barely move.

162
00:18:46,600 --> 00:19:00,600
2, 3, 4, front. Now we're going to run it off.

163
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Front... knees up, knees up.

164
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
OK. Finish off by jogging in place.

165
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,600
OK. Keep those knees up.

166
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
All right. That's it for today.

167
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Thank you, everyone. See you next week.

168
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Thank you, Jack, but no thank you.

169
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,600
The advanced exercise class is not so easy, huh?

170
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:26,600
No, no, you were right. I was wrong.

171
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Come on, Richard. Get up. Let's go.

172
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,600
You have to cook dinner for the entire family.

173
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Marilyn, I'm exhausted. I can't move.

174
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Oh, you'll do it. It's a piece of cake.

175
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Excuse me, Richard, Marilyn.

176
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,600
You are a terrific instructor, Jack.

177
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Thanks. But I have a question.

178
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Is this your very first advanced aerobics class?

179
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Yes, it is.

180
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
You are in great shape, Richard.

Very few people last in this class

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,600
for the full hour the very first time.

00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,600
It's true. You are in great shape.

184
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Thanks!

00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,600
