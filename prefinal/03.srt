Episode 03 - Grandpa's Trunk

3
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Marilyn, you want coffee or tea?

4
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Coffee, please.

5
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:10,600
I am so excited!

6
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
At this time tomorrow morning,

7
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Grandpa will be sitting in the kitchen with us.

8
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,600
When does he arrive?

9
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
At six o'clock this evening.

10
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
By plane?

11
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
No, by train.

12
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Are we picking him up at the station?

13
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Not Grandpa.

14
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
He doesn't want anybody picking him up.

15
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
He likes to be independent.

16
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Oh, let's go upstairs and prepare Grandpa's room.

17
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Great! Let's do it!

18
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Good morning, Mom.

19
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Morning.

20
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Well, hi, fellas.

21
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,000
Hello.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,600
Hi, honey.

23
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Morning, Marilyn.

24
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
We are going upstairs to set up Grandpa's room.

25
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
There's coffee ready.

26
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,600
I'm really excited about seeing Grandpa.

27
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Me, too. Milk, please.

28
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
He's so funny.

29
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
He always makes me laugh.

30
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I hope Grandpa's going to like living with us.

31
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I think he will.

32
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
It just takes time to feel comfortable in a new place.

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Won't he miss being in Florida?

34
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Well, he will.

35
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
But I think he'll like being here with the family.

36
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Are you sure about that?

37
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
It's crazy here most of the time.

38
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
But it's fun.

39
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
That's for sure.

40
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
You know,

41
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
maybe I'll put together some photos of Grandpa

42
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
as a "welcome" present.

43
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
That's a neat idea.

44
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
What can I do?

45
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
I've got it!

46
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,600
I have a picture of Grandpa and Dad and me in my wallet.

47
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,600
It's from the Fathers and Sons' Breakfast

48
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
at my junior high school graduation.

49
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Oh, I remember this picture.

50
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,600
I'd really like to pick up Grandpa at the railroad station.

51
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Railroad stations or airports--

52
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Grandpa always tells us he'll get here by himself.

53
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
He's something!

54
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Is this all Grandpa's stuff?

55
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
That's it.

56
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,600
But I'm sure he has a few bags with him on the train.

57
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
What's inside?

58
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,600
I don't know. It's locked.

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Hi.

60
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Oh, hi, darling.

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Morning, Philip.

62
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
I want to put some of my good hangers in Grandpa's closet.

63
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
You know I'm very excited about his arrival.

64
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
We are, too.

65
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Susan called early this morning.

66
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
She's unhappy

67
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
because she's had to go to Chicago on a business trip

68
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
and can't leave till tonight.

69
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
She wants to be here for Grandpa.

70
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Well, Grandpa will be disappointed, too.

71
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
He loves Susan.

72
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
She always reminds him of Grandma. Susan.

73
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Well, how's everything here?

74
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Fine. We were just wondering about this trunk.

75
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,600
It's locked.

76
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Oh. I have the key. Grandpa sent it to me.

77
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

78
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
No, it's not taken.

79
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Oh, thank you.

80
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Oh, let me help you with this.

81
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Oh, thank you.

82
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Do you want to sit by the window?

83
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
No, no, no. I like the aisle seat better.

84
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Please, you sit by the window.

85
00:07:51,600 --> 00:08:00,600
My name is Stewart... Malcolm Stewart.

86
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Pleased to meet you.

87
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
I'm Elsa Tobin. How do you do?

88
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Do you live in New York?

89
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
No, no. I'm from Florida.

90
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,600
I am, too. But didn't you just get on?

91
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,600
No, no. I just changed my seat.

92
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
A man next to me was smoking,

93
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,600
and smoke really bothers me.

94
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Where are you from in Florida?

95
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Titusville. It's near Orlando.

96
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Small world. I'm from Titusville, too.

97
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Really? What part?

98
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
My husband and I live near Spaceport.

99
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
I know that area.

100
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,600
My house is only a few miles from Spaceport.

101
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Do you still live there?

102
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Oh yes, yes. My husband's there now.

103
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,600
He couldn't take time off to come to New York with me.

104
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Do you still live there?

105
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,600
No. I sold the house and the furniture,

106
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,600
put a few personal things in an old trunk,

107
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,600
and shipped it to my children in New York.

108
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
That's my destination.

109
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Are you married?

110
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,600
My wife died four years ago.

111
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,600
She was a wonderful woman. A real friend.

112
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,600
I'm sorry. Really, I'm sorry.

113
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Lots of wonderful memories.

114
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,600
We were married almost fifty years.

115
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Well, forty-seven, to be exact.

116
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,600
John and I celebrate our fortieth anniversary next month.

117
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Oh, congratulations! That's nice.

118
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,600
What does John do?

119
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
He's an aerospace engineer

120
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
and works for Orlando Aircraft Corporation.

121
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,600
He started with them almost forty years ago.

122
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
What do you do?

123
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,600
I just retired. Had my own company.

124
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,600
A construction company. Roads, bridges, big stuff.

125
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,600
But I just sold it and retired.

126
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Excuse me, ma'am. Ticket, please.

127
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Would you kindly hold these keys, please?

128
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,600
I have a ticket, I know.

129
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
I was in the smoking section.

130
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
It's OK, lady. Take your time.

131
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,600
I'm sure it's in your purse, Mrs. Tobin.

132
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Oh, here it is.

133
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,600
And here are your keys.

134
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Thank you.

135
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Do you have family in New York?

136
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,600
No, no. But I do have very close friends in New York City.

137
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,600
We like to go to the theater together.

138
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,600
You said you have family in New York.

139
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Yes, indeed.

140
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,600
A son and his wife and their three children -

141
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
my grandchildren.

142
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
You must be excited.

143
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,600
I can't wait, to see them!

144
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Are you going to live with them?

145
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Yes.

146
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Permanently?

147
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Well... they want me to,

148
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,600
but it's too early to know for sure.

149
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I'm pretty independent.

150
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,600
I tried to teach my kids the importance of independence,

151
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,600
but I'm not sure I want to be alone.

152
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Some people don't mind being alone. I do.

153
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I understand. But tell me.

154
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Why did you stop working?

155
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:07,600
I retired because... I wanted to be with my family.

156
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,600
I didn't want to be alone anymore!

157
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

158
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Amtrak is happy to announce our arrival in New York City.

159
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,600
The train will be stopping in five minutes.

160
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Please check to be sure you have your belongings.

161
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
And have a good stay in the Big Apple.

162
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Thank you.

163
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Well, here we are.

164
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,600
It was so nice meeting you, Mr. Stewart.

165
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,600
And nice meeting you, too, Mrs. Tobin.

166
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Please look us up.

167
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
We're in the phone book.

168
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Dr. Philip Stewart, in Riverdale.

169
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Your son?

170
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,600
That's right. And have a good time in New York.

171
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,600
And don't be so independent.

172
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,600
You're very lucky to have a caring family.

173
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:55,600
When can we go fishing?

174
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Robbie, we'll go fishing soon,

175
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
and we'll take your dad with us.

176
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,600
I'm ready, Grandpa. You name the day.

177
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
That's a great idea, Grandpa!

178
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Philip needs a day off.

179
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Let's give him our presents now.

180
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Good idea.

181
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Presents, for me?

182
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,600
From me and Marilyn.

183
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
And this one's from me.

184
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,600
I looked all over the house to find it.

185
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Richard, these are terrific pictures.

186
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:53,600
This one really brings back memories.

187
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,600
You remember that day, Robbie?

188
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
I sure do. It was fun.

189
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Oh, I'm sorry Susan isn't here.

190
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
I miss her very much.

191
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,600
She feels bad, too, Grandpa.

192
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,600
She called to say the plane was delayed.

193
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
You know airports.

194
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
I can't wait to see her.

195
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,600
She looks just like Grandma at that age.

196
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,600
I'd better unpack.

197
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,600
I started traveling twenty-four hours ago.

198
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,600
I'm not so young anymore.

199
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Don't you want something to eat?

200
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
No, thanks.

201
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
After a good night's sleep, I'll enjoy breakfast even more.

202
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Well, come on, Dad.

203
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Ellen and I'll take you to your room.

204
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
I'm sure glad you're here, Grandpa.

205
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Good night, Grandpa.

206
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Pleasant dreams.

207
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Philip, do you have the key to the trunk?

208
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,600
I have the key, but it doesn't work.

209
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:26,600
I sent the wrong key.

210
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:42,600
I have something for you. I made it myself.

211
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
I think you'll enjoy it.

212
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,600
I researched it for over a year.

213
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
It's our family tree.

214
00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Oh, Grandpa! How exciting!

215
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Fabulous!

216
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Why, I didn't know that your grandfather was born in Germany.

217
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Lots of interesting information about our family.

218
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
A gift from me.

219
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Thank you so much.

220
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Grandpa! Grandpa!

221
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Oh, Grandpa, I'm so happy to see you!

222
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Oh, you look so beautiful, Susan. My granddaughter.

223
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Like I always said, you look just like Grandma.

224
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,600
I think you're going to be very happy here with us.

225
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I know you will.

226
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:55,600
I don't feel alone anymore.
