Episode 05 - The Right Magic

3
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Hi, Grandpa.

4
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Hi, Robbie.

5
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Can I help?

6
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Yes, indeed.

7
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Hand me two eggs from the refrigerator,

8
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,600
and I'll make you two fried eggs.

9
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,600
How about some bacon?

10
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I made enough for an army.

11
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,600
You going to the baseball game today?

12
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,600
It's a perfect day for it, a little cloudy but nice and warm.

13
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Dad and I were planning to go to the game,

14
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
but he has to work today,

15
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
and my friends don't want to go.

16
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
It's not an important game, anyway.

17
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Do you have any other plans for the day?

18
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
I'll work on my computer.

19
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,600
I have a new math program, and I want to learn how to use it.

20
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Maybe you can teach me

21
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
how to work on a computer someday.

22
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Anytime. It's really easy, but, like anything,

23
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
you need to work at it, Grandpa.

24
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,600
This bacon is great.

25
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I love crispy bacon.

26
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Oh, what are you doing tomorrow?

27
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Nothing much.

28
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Well, maybe your dad and I could take you fishing with us.

29
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
I'd like that, but...

30
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
But what?

31
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
But Dad is always so busy.

32
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Well, can you come fishing with me tomorrow?

33
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Sure, I can.

34
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Robbie says you can't take him to the game today.

35
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
I really feel bad about it,

36
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
but they need me at the hospital today,

37
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
in the children's ward.

38
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
I understand.

39
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Maybe we can spend some time together next weekend.

40
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Definitely.

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
We should.

42
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
You and Robbie and me.

43
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Remember our first fishing trip?

44
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
I sure do...

45
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Well, I've got to run, Dad.

46
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
See you later.

47
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Going fishing?

48
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
I'm thinking about it...

49
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,600
So, how's work?

50
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Oh, the usual problems.

51
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
You're working pretty hard these days.

52
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
I guess I am.

53
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,600
When did you last go fishing with Robbie?

54
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
I remember exactly.

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
It was on his birthday, June second, two years ago.

56
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,600
We didn't catch anything.

57
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Remember our fishing trips?

58
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Yes. I loved them.

59
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Remember catching your first fish?

60
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,600
How can I forget?

61
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
I fell out of the boat!

62
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,600
We had some good times together.

63
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Yes, we did.

64
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Maybe we should do it again.

65
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
How about tomorrow?

66
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Don't you have to work?

67
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
My paper work will wait.

68
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Oh, Robbie will be thrilled.

69
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
I am, too, Son.

70
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
I want to spend more time with Robbie.

71
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Tomorrow.

72
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
It'll be like old times for you and me.

73
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
And Robbie will love it.

74
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Well, what's the weather going to be like?

75
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Radio says sunny and mild.

76
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Well, I'll tell Robbie.

77
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,600
And thanks, Dad.

78
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Don't thank me.

79
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
I'm just being a grandfather.

80
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,600
This is really neat!

81
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,600
When do we eat?

82
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,600
First, we have to catch some fish.

83
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,600
In order to catch fish, you have to do this.

84
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Here we go.

85
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
That's it.

86
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Then drop it into the water.

87
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,600
All of this comes before eating. OK?

88
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,600
How do you know so much about fishing?

89
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Grandpa taught me.

90
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
We spent a lot of time fishing together.

91
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Now, the important thing is to get the hook close to the fish.

92
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
All right?

93
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Like this.

94
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:54,600
I think I see some fish right under us, Dad.

95
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Oh, not a chance!

96
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
I just saw a big one!

97
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Hi, there!

98
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Hi.

99
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
What's your name?

100
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Albert.

101
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Are you all alone?

102
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Yes, sir.

103
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,600
How old are you, Albert?

104
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
I'm ten.

105
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Where's your father?

106
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
He's up there at the lodge.

107
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Does he know you're here?

108
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Yes, sir.

109
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,600
OK, Robbie, maybe you should watch him.

110
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
The water's pretty deep here.

111
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
I'll watch him, Dad.

112
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:36,600
What time is it?

113
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,600
It's almost lunchtime, and no fish yet.

114
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I can go up to the lodge for some hot dogs and drinks.

115
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
No way!

116
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
We're here to catch our lunch.

117
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,600
To catch fish, you need the right magic.

118
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
That's right.

119
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
I forgot!

120
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
The right magic.

121
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Do it for Robbie, Dad.

122
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
You remember?

123
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Sure. Come on.

124
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Well, first, you have to turn your hat around like this.

125
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Then you close your eyes and say the magic words.

126
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Fish, fish, send me a fish.

127
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Fish, fish, send me a fish... I got one!

128
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
See, it works!

129
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
It's a big one!

130
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Well, it always worked for me, too.

131
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Grandpa, get the net, please!

132
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Dad, you got one, too!

133
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
You bet I have!

134
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Easy, Philip, easy.

135
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Sorry, Dad.

136
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Well, one more and I've got a pair of boots.

137
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,600
You didn't say the magic words.

138
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Robbie's right.

139
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Yes, but you did, and we've got our lunch.

140
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Let's build a fire and cook it!

141
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Come on, Albert, you can help us!

142
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
I want to stay here and fish.

143
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,600
All right, but be careful.

144
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:23,600
Is it finished yet?

145
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
I think so.

146
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
I hope you like your fish well done.

147
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Burned, you mean.

148
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Hey, I'm a doctor, not a chef.

149
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Help! Help! I can't swim!

150
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Dad! Grandpa! He fell in!

151
00:12:48,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Easy does it, Robbie.

152
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
That a boy.

153
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
That's it.

154
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
He's not breathing, Philip!

155
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Robbie, run to the car!

156
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Bring a blanket and my medical bag.

157
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Yes, Dad.

158
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Now, come on, son. Come on, son.

159
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Breathe, Albert!

160
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Here's the bag.

161
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Will he be OK, Dad?

162
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
I hope so.

163
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,600
That's it.

164
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
That's the way.

165
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
That's it. There.

166
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Oh, it's going to be all right.

167
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
That's it.

168
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Wrap him in the blanket, Dad!

169
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
That's it. That's it.

170
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
It's all right, Albert.

171
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
You're going to be OK.

172
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,600
I want my daddy!

173
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
We'll take you to him.

174
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,600
Easy now. Easy does it. That's it.

175
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Your dad is quite a guy.

176
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
I know, Grandpa.

177
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
How is he, Philip?

178
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
He's asleep.

179
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
He's going to be fine.

180
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
How can I thank all of you?

181
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Thank my son Robbie.

182
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
He pulled him out of the water.

183
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
I'm very grateful, Robbie.

184
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Dad saved him, not me.

185
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
I'm so thankful to all of you.

186
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,600
So long.

187
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,600
He's a lucky boy.

188
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Well, what do you say we get back to our fishing?

189
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
That's a great idea.

190
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Uh-oh. It's probably the hospital.

191
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
I have to get to a phone.

192
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,600
It probably means we can't stay.

193
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
That's OK.

194
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:39,600
One of my patients has a high fever,

195
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
and I have to go to the hospital.

196
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
I'm sorry, Robbie.

197
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
I guess I ruined your day.

198
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
You didn't ruin my day, Dad.

199
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,600
I understand. I really do.

200
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Why are you back so early?

201
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Philip had to go back to the hospital.

202
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
He had an emergency.

203
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Oh, that's too bad, Robbie.

204
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Did it spoil your fun?

205
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
No, Mom. We had a great time.

206
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Well, did you do any fishing?

207
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Yeah, we caught lots of them. Look!

208
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,600
They had a special on frozen fish down at the supermarket.

209
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Oh, you really had a bad day.

210
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
We had a good day.

211
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Robbie pulled a boy out of the water.

212
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
And Dad saved his life.

213
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
He's a terrific doctor, Mom.

214
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
I know.

215
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Hi, Pop. Hi, Son.

216
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Hello, Dad.

217
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
What a day!

218
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
How about a cup of coffee, Son?

219
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,600
I'd love a cup of coffee.

220
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:29,600
How was the patient?

221
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
She'll be fine.

222
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Was it serious?

223
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
No.

224
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Until today, I was never really interested in medicine.

225
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Well, it's hard work.

226
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Now I know.

227
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,600
I had a good time today, Robbie.

228
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Me, too.

229
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Why don't we do it again?

230
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Can we? When?

231
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
How about next Saturday?

232
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Won't you be busy?

233
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,600
I'm changing my schedule.

234
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Well, do we have a date?

235
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
We sure do, Dad.

236
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Grandpa, can you come?

237
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
I have other plans, Robbie.

238
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,600
But I think you two can have a good time together without me.

239
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,600
No, Dad, and certainly not without the right magic.
