Episode 01 - 46 Linden Street

3
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,000
Excuse me.

4
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
My name is Richard Stewart.

5
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm a photographer.

6
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
May I take a picture of you and your little boy?

7
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,500
What's it for?

8
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,600
It's for a book.

9
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
You're writing a book?

10
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
It's a book of pictures.

11
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
I call it Family Album, U.S.A.

12
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Oh, that's a nice idea.

13
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Well, it's fine if you take our picture.

14
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
I'm Martha Vann.

15
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Thank you. I appreciate your help.

16
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm Richard. What's your name?

17
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Gerald. Gerald

18
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
How old are you, Gerald?

19
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Five.

20
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
And where do you live?

21
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
We live in California.

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Well, welcome to New York.

23
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
OK, just a second.

24
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I'm almost ready here.

25
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Can I help you?

26
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Oh, please.

27
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Hold Gerald's hand, please.

28
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Great!

29
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Now point to the buildings.

30
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Terrific!

31
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Give Mommy a kiss, Gerald.

32
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Nice!

33
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Thank you, Gerald.

34
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,600
And thank you, Mrs. Vann.

35
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Oh, my pleasure.

36
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
We'll be looking for your book.

37
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Thank you. Good-bye. Bye, Gerald.

38
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Thanks again.

39
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Oh, you're welcome.

40
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Hey, let me take your picture!

41
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Wonderful. Please.

42
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Are you from New York?

43
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
No, I'm from Greece.

44
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
I'm an exchange student.

45
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
When did you come here?

46
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Three months ago.

47
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Your English is very good.

48
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Thanks.

49
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
I studied English in school.

50
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Would you like some coffee?

51
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
No, thank you.

52
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Tell me about your book.

53
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Oh, it's not finished yet,

54
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
but I have some of the pictures.

55
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Would you like to see them?

56
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Yes. I'd like that.

57
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Here they are.

58
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Family Album, U.S.A.

59
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
It's an album of pictures of the United States:

60
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
the cities, the special places, and the people.

61
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
And these are pictures of people working:

62
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:47,600
steelworkers, bankers, police, street vendors,

63
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:55,600
ambulance drivers, doctors...

64
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Oh, this is my father. He's a doctor.

65
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,600
This is my mother.

66
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
What's her name?

67
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Ellen.

68
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,600
My younger brother, Robbie.

69
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
He goes to high school.

70
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
This is my sister Susan.

71
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,600
She works for a toy company.

72
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Here's my grandfather.

73
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
He lives in Florida.

74
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
And this is my wife Marilyn.

75
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Oh, she's very pretty.

76
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Thanks. And what about your family?

77
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
They are in Thessaloniki.

78
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,600
That's a large city in northern Greece.

79
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
But now I'm living in the Bronx.

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
With a Greek-American family?

81
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
No. Hispanic.

82
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Oh no! It's five thirty.

83
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Will you excuse me?

84
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
I have to meet my wife.

85
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
It was nice meeting you.

86
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
It was a pleasure meeting you, too.

87
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Thanks for your help.

88
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,600
And good luck! I've got to go.

89
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
By the way, I'm Richard.

90
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
What's your name?

91
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Alexandra.

92
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Bye-bye, Alexandra. Thanks.

93
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Bye-bye.

94
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Richard! Richard!

95
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
You left your bag!

96
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Excuse me, officer. Can you help me?

97
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,200
Sure.

98
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
Can you tell me how to get to Linden Street in Riverdale?

99
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Richard Stewart, 46 Linden Street, Riverdale, New York.

100
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You should take the number 1 subway.

101
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Is there a station near here?

102
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yes. The station's that way.

103
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You should take the number 1 train to Van Cortlandt Park.

104
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Number 1 train to Van Cortlandt Park. Thank you.

105
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Anytime. Good luck.

106
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Remember, the number 1 train. The uptown platform.

107
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Thank you.

108
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You're welcome.

109
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,000
Is this pink too bright for me?

110
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Mmm-hmm. It is a very bright pink.

111
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Try this. It's size eight.

112
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But I wear size ten.

113
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
How about green? It's size ten.

114
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Let me try it on.

115
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm taking too much of your time.

116
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's six o'clock.

117
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Where's my husband?

118
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,300
Where's my husband?

119
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,000
I was expecting him here at five forty-five.

120
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Don't worry. The traffic is very heavy at this hour.

121
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I know. But we're going to be late for dinner.

122
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'll take this green sweater.

123
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I like the color on me, don't you?

124
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I think it looks terrific on you.

125
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm sorry I'm so late.

126
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I had a really bad day.

127
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's ten after six. We're late.

128
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Robbie's cooking tonight, and dinner's at six thirty.

129
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I know. I know. I'm really sorry.

130
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I left my bag of film on the ferry.

131
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I went back for it, but the ferry was gone.

132
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I lost a whole day's work.

133
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'll call the Staten Island Ferry lost-and-found office.

134
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I didn't think of that. Thanks.

135
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,000
Hello.

136
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yes. The number, please,

137
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
of the Staten Island Ferry lost-and-found office.

138
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Five five five... zero eight zero eight.

139
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Thank you.

140
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I really appreciate it, Marilyn.

141
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I really appreciate it, Marilyn.

142
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Hello.

143
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Did anyone find a camera bag this afternoon,

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
a small canvas bag,

145
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
on the J. F. Kennedy Ferry? No?

146
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Maybe someone will find it.

147
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The name is Stewart, Richard Stewart.

148
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And the telephone number is five five five...

149
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
three oh nine oh. Thank you.

150
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Sorry, Richard. They don't have it.

151
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Thanks, anyway.

152
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
There was a girl on the ferry.

153
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Now maybe...

154
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Tell me about it on the way home.

155
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And give her a teaspoon of the medicine after every meal.

156
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

157
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You're welcome. Good-bye.

158
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:27,000
How are you?

159
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm tired and hungry.

160
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Well, Marilyn and Richard called.

161
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They'll be here soon, and then we'll eat.

162
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
All right. Is... is Susan coming?

163
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Well, she'll be here later.

164
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
She has to work late tonight.

165
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And what's Robbie cooking for dinner?

166
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's a surprise.

167
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I hope it's pasta.

168
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Robbie, the dinner was terrific.

169
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yes, it was delicious.

170
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What's for dessert?

171
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh, I forgot dessert.

172
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Robbie!

173
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Don't worry.

174
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We've got lots of ice cream.

175
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh, I'd love some ice cream.

176
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Well, there's chocolate and coffee and a little vanilla.

177
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'll have vanilla.

178
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Is that all right with everyone?

179
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'll have chocolate.

180
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Me, too.

181
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Uh, one scoop of coffee

182
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and one scoop of chocolate for me.

183
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Robbie, will you help me serve?

184
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:43,000
I keep thinking about that bag of film. Eight rolls.

185
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
A whole day's work.

186
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And good stuff, too.

187
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Don't worry, Richard.

188
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Someone will find it.

189
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'll get it. Hello.

190
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Hello.

191
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Does Richard Stewart live here?

192
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yes, he's my brother.

193
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm Robbie... Robbie Stewart.

194
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm Alexandra Pappas.

195
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
How do you do?

196
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Your brother left his bag of film on the ferryboat.

197
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I found it.

198
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm really glad to see you.

199
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I mean... my brother'll be really glad to see you!

200
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Robbie! Who is it?

201
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's Richard's film!

202
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I mean, Alexandra Pappas.

203
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Come in, please.

204
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Alexandra!

205
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Hello, Richard. I found your bag!

206
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

207
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Um... Alexandra, let me introduce you.

208
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
This is my wife Marilyn.

209
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Richard showed me your photo.

210
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
How do you do?

211
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Oh yes.

212
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Richard told us all about you.

213
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's nice to meet you.

214
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And this is my mother, Ellen Stewart.

215
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How do you do?

216
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And my father, Dr. Philip Stewart.

217
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Nice to meet you, Alexandra.

218
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And... ah... you met Robbie.

219
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yes. And you must be Susan. Hi.

220
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Hi. Welcome.

221
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm so glad you found the bag

222
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and took the time and trouble to return it.

223
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh, it was no trouble.

224
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I just took the wrong train.

225
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Would you like something to eat?

226
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Thank you, no.

227
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm late for dinner at my house.

228
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I really have to go.

229
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Would you like to call home?

230
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'd appreciate that.

231
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Please, use the phone.

232
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Thanks. Excuse me.

233
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Alexandra is a high-school exchange student from Greece.

234
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Where does she live?

235
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
With a family in the Bronx.

236
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh, that's not too far from here!

237
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Take it easy, Robbie.

238
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Thank you.

239
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I can only stay a few minutes.

240
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Have some iced tea.

241
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Thanks, Mrs. Stewart.

242
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Please sit down, Alexandra.

243
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So, you're an exchange student.

244
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Where do you go to school?

245
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
At the Bronx High School of Science.

246
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Oh, that's a very good school.

247
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
What are your favorite subjects?

248
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Biology and mathematics.

249
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Richard tells me you're a doctor.

250
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yes, a pediatrician.

251
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And what does your father do?

252
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
He's a lawyer, in Thessaloniki.

253
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Would you like some pasta?

254
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I made it myself.

255
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It might be a little cold.

256
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Thanks, no. I do have to go.

257
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It was nice meeting you all.

258
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Well, maybe you'll come for lunch some Sunday,

259
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
so we can really thank you

260
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
for bringing Richard's bag back.

261
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Maybe.

262
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You're welcome anytime.

263
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Good-bye.

264
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Can I drive you home?

265
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
No, thanks.

266
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
The train is just up the street.

267
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It won't take me long at all.

268
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Well, you really saved the day for me, Alexandra.

269
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Bye.

270
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Bye-bye.

271
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Good night.

272
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:13,000
She's a smart young lady, and very nice.

273
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Very! Hey, she forgot her bag!

274
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I guess we'll be seeing Alexandra again.

275
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Right, Robbie?
