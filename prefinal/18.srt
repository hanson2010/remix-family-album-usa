Episode 18 - Making a Difference

3
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,600
I don't believe it!

4
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
What's wrong?

5
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Carter Boswell!

6
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Who's Carter Boswell?

7
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
He's running for the school board.

8
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
The election's next month.

9
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
What's wrong with wanting to be on the school board?

10
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Nothing.

11
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
But he wants to cut the school budget!

12
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Maybe it needs cutting.

13
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Cutting the budget is fine,

14
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
but he wants to do it

15
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
by cutting all the cultural programs.

16
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
No music, no dance,

17
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
no concert, no stage presentations.

18
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Why does he want to do that?

19
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,600
He says it's to save the taxpayers' money,

20
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
and I think he believes

21
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
that the taxpayers will vote for him

22
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
if he spends less on the cultural programs.

23
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
He's probably right.

24
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Lots of people want their taxes

25
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
used for new books

26
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
and a new paint job in the schoolrooms.

27
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Maybe some of us would like to pay a little bit more

28
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
and keep the cultural programs for our kids.

29
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Well, I'm not sure. Ellen.

30
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,600
I hear it from my patients.

31
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Lots of people are tired of higher taxes.

32
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
I know,

33
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
but if Boswell wins

34
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
he'll be an important decision-maker

35
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
on the school board,

36
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
and he doesn't know anything

37
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
about our children's education.

38
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Who's running against him?

39
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Nobody. That's the problem.

40
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Well, it sounds to me like Carter Boswell

41
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
is going to win this seat on the board.

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Oh, not if I can stop him!

43
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
And how are you going to stop him?

44
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
I don't know.

45
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Maybe I'll run against him.

46
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Well, you've got my vote.

47
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,600
I'm serious, Philip.

48
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Why shouldn't I run?

49
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Why shouldn't you run for what, Mom?

50
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Your mother is thinking of

51
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
running for the school board.

52
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Hey, that's terrific, Mom!

53
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Against Carter Boswell?

54
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Great!

55
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Well, if I run for office,

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
the voters will have a clear choice.

57
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,600
I stand for everything Boswell doesn't.

58
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
I think a lot of people will vote for you

59
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
against Boswell, Ellen.

60
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
I'll vote for you.

61
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Will you help me if I do run?

62
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Absolutely.

63
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
The trouble is

64
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
it takes a little bit of money to run a campaign.

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,600
I think you can make a difference, Ellen.

66
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
And in a short campaign

67
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
you wouldn't need as much money.

68
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
You know something, Ellen?

69
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Why not give the people of Riverdale a clear choice?

70
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
I'm with you.

71
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
You can make a difference.

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Come in.

73
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Mr. Maxwell?

74
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Yes, Charles Maxwell.

75
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
My name is Ellen Stewart.

76
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Hello.

77
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Please, sit down.

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,600
You asked to see me.

79
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
What would you like to see me about?

80
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,600
I'd like your help.

81
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Well,

82
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,600
I'm editor of the most influential newspaper in Riverdale.

83
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Actually, it's the only newspaper.

84
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
A lot of people would like my help.

85
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Do you have a story?

86
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
I'm planning to run for the school board.

87
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Against Carter Boswell?

88
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Yes.

89
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Well, that is news.

90
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Will you announce that I'm running?

91
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Sure.

92
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
But I need some information.

93
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Of course.

94
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Why will the voters vote for you against Boswell,

95
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Mrs. Stewart? Stewart

96
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Because I care.

97
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,600
"Vote for Ellen Stewart. She cares."

98
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Not a bad slogan.

99
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,600
But what do you care about?

100
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Well, I care about the children of our town.

101
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
I don't want them to grow up

102
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
without cultural programs in our school.

103
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Do you have a plan?

104
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,600
I want our children to learn

105
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
more than reading, writing, and arithmetic.

106
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,600
I want to keep the after-school programs -

107
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
the music, the concerts.

108
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,600
It's not a bad plan.

109
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
But who's going to pay for all of this?

110
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
We are.

111
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,600
The citizens of Riverdale, of course.

112
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
I plan to get help

113
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
from the businessmen and the corporations of Riverdale.

114
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
That's fair enough.

115
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Exactly what do you want from me, Mrs. Stewart?

116
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,600
You don't know me.

117
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,600
I can't expect you to take my side against Boswell.

118
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
But I do need some publicity

119
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
so that the people of our town

120
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
know that I'm running for office

121
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
and that I care about our children.

122
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Fair enough.

123
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,600
I certainly can print the news.

124
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
And you are now making news.

125
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Here are the fliers, hot off the press!

126
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Looks good.

127
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Simple.

128
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Right over here, Grandpa.

129
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
You fold the fliers.

130
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Richard and I will put them into the envelopes.

131
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
We finished addressing over three hundred envelopes.

132
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Need another box?

133
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Good work, gang.

134
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Hi, this is Mike Johnson.

135
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs. Anderson?

136
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Mr. Nelson.

137
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Hi. This is Robbie Stewart.

138
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Did you know

139
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
my mother is running for the school board?

140
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Yes, Miss Kim, Ellen Stewart.

141
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
"She cares."

142
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Oh, see you at the polls.

143
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Certainly.

144
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
I'll give her your best wishes,

145
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Mr. Nelson. Nelson

146
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Hi, this is Mike Johnson.

147
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs. Burns?

148
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Thank you.

149
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
We have done so much

150
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
in such a short amount of time.

151
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
I can't believe it!

152
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Wait till Philip comes home and sees our progress.

153
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Everyone saw the story in the Riverdale newspaper.

154
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Mr. Maxwell was very kind

155
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
to print my announcement.

156
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
It helps enormously.

157
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Everybody in Riverdale reads his paper.

158
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Your photo in it helped, too.

159
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Thanks to you, Richard,

160
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
it's a good picture.

161
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Well, hi, all.

162
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Hi, Dad.

163
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Hello, darling.

164
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
May I... may I help?

165
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Licking envelopes.

166
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I fold the fliers.

167
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
We stuff them.

168
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,600
And I lick the envelopes.

169
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Hey, everybody,

170
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Mrs. Greenberg is on the phone.

171
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
She says Carter Boswell is on the TV right now -

172
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
doing a commercial.

173
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
What channel?

174
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Five.

175
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,600
And if you ask what I care about, I'll tell you.

176
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,600
I care about the school buildings in need of paint.

177
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
I care about more lockers for the teachers.

178
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,600
I care about new fixtures in the hallways,

179
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
not music or dancing or entertainment.

180
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,600
I care about the practical things.

181
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,600
If you do, vote for me, Carter Boswell.

182
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,600
A lot of people will agree with him.

183
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,600
I told you.

184
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Too bad kids can't vote.

185
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
It's our school, but we can't vote.

186
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,600
There are people in favor of the cultural programs, Mom.

187
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
There are, Ellen.

188
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Don't be upset by Boswell's commercial.

189
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,600
You have to go on television, too.

190
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Boswell's a powerful speaker.

191
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,600
You can be, too.

192
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Your ideas are good ones.

193
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,600
I don't know.

194
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,600
I'm not sure I'm up to it.

195
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,600
My slogan is "I care".

196
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,600
I care about people, not things.

197
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Vote for me, Ellen Stewart.

198
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
I care.

199
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,600
How was it?

200
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
You were terrific!

201
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Can I see it?

202
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Sure.

203
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Hello. My name is Ellen Stewart,

204
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,600
and I'm running for the open seat on the school board.

205
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,600
My slogan is "I care".

206
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,600
What does the word care mean?

207
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,600
I care about people, not things.

208
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Vote for me, Ellen Stewart.

209
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I care.

210
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,600
I like it,

211
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
but now what?

212
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,600
How can we possibly get it on so Riverdale

213
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
will see it and hear it?

214
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Leave it to me.

215
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,600
I mean that when I say "I care",

216
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,600
I care about people, not things.

217
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Vote for me, Ellen Stewart.

218
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
I care.

219
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
What happened?

220
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Mom is now on television

221
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
in every appliance store in Riverdale,

222
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
except Hamlin's.

223
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
He's a Boswell voter.

224
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
That's a brilliant idea, Richard!

225
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
You inherited your father's brains.

226
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,600
We got our brains from you, Dad.

227
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
And guess what?

228
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
I called channel five.

229
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
I called channel five.

230
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Their TV news is going to cover it.

231
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,600
"Housewife campaigns in appliance stores."

232
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
And I'll bet

233
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
some magazine will pick up the story, too.

234
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Mom, you're going to win!

235
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
I know it!

236
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Hold it, Robbie!

237
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Just cool down.

238
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
I know we're getting some attention now,

239
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
but in the end the voters will have to decide.

240
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,600
You're gonna win.

241
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Trust me!

242
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,600
In the hotly contested race

243
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,600
for the one seat on the Riverdale School Board,

244
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Mrs. Ellen Stewart has taken an early lead.

245
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
She's winning!

246
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Mom, you're winning!

247
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Now returning to other local news...

248
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
Riverdale High School Riverdale

249
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
beat its rival Horace Mann in baseball today It's too soon to know for certain.

250
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
It's too soon to know for certain.

251
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
You're ahead.

252
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
That's better than being behind.

253
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
More sports after this.

254
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
It's not over yet.

255
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Let's just all calm down,

256
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
and wait for the final results.

257
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Ellen, why don't you go out to the backyard

258
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
and get some fresh air?

259
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Thank you, Grandpa.

260
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
I need some.

261
00:17:46,600 --> 00:18:08,600
What happened?

262
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:15,600
You came very close, Ellen.

263
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,600
You lost by only a hundred and twenty-one votes.

264
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:28,600
I lost.

265
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
You tried, Mom.

266
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,600
You lost by a very small number of votes.

267
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Only one hundred and twenty-one votes!

268
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
I'm sorry, Mom.

269
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,600
There just wasn't enough time.

270
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Look,

271
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
you've made a very strong impression

272
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
on our community.

273
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,600
You'll have another chance next election.

274
00:18:50,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Hello.

275
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Oh, yes, yes, Mr. Maxwell.

276
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Hello, Mr. Maxwell.

277
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
How are you?

278
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
I just called to tell you

279
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
that you are very impressive.

280
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
You lost the election,

281
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
but you won the attention of the residents of Riverdale,

282
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
of Boswell, and of me.

283
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Well, thank you, Mr. Maxwell.

284
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
I appreciate your kind words.

285
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
I needed that.

286
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
I hear Boswell

287
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
wants to appoint you to a special arts committee.

288
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I'm sending over a reporter

289
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
in the morning to interview you.

290
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
You are?

291
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,600
I'm gonna do an article

292
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
on "Ellen Stewart, she cares".

293
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Maybe we'll all care now.

294
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Good-bye.

295
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Thank you,

296
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
and good-bye.

297
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:07,600
What was that about?

298
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
You were right, Philip.

299
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,600
I did make a difference in town.

300
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
And in this family.
