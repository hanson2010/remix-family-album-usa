1
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,600
There's your teddy bear, Max.

2
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,600
He just loves that teddy bear

3
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
that Grandpa Philip bought for him.

4
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,600
I took him to Philip's office yesterday for a checkup.

5
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,600
You should have seen the look on his face

6
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,600
when Molly gave him the injection. Molly

7
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Oh, did he cry?

8
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
No.

9
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,600
My dear little boy just looked up at me as if to say,

10
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,600
"Mama, what are they doing to me? Help!"

11
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
How did you feel?

12
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Tell the truth.

13
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Didn't you feel terrible?

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
I sure did.

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,600
I held him closely.

16
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,600
I kissed the top of his dear little head.

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,600
He looked up at me.

18
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
He tried to smile.

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Being with him helped.

20
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Helped him?

21
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Or helped you?

22
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Being a mother is not easy,

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
if that's what you mean.

24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Speaking of being a mother,

25
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,600
I've been meaning to ask you

26
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,600
what you were thinking about regarding going back to work.

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
I know Rita Mae called.

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
I can imagine what is going through your head.

29
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
I'm sure you can, Ellen.

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
There are so many things to consider.

31
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,600
One thing that makes it easier for you

32
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
is that you have us.

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Max will always have a family member to watch over him

34
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
while you're at work.

35
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I didn't have that when Richard and Susan were born.

36
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
What did you do?

37
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,600
I chose to continue with my career as a music teacher.

38
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,600
We hired a woman to watch Richard and then Susan,

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,600
and I continued with my career.

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Do you think you made the right decision?

41
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
I think I did.

42
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
But when Robbie was born,

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
I decided to give full-time attention to raising Robbie.

44
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
I felt differently at that time.

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
And you gave up your career as a music teacher?

46
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Not exactly.

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
I continued to teach piano lessons at home.

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,600
How did you feel about being away

49
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,600
when Susan and Richard were babies?

50
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
I think I did the right thing

51
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,600
for them and for myself and for Philip.

52
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
We needed the money.

53
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Well, we do too, Ellen.

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Everything I earn helps us towards getting that house

55
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
we want and need.

56
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,600
I can't wait till he's just a little older.

57
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Our toy company makes the most wonderful toys for kids.

58
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Max thanks you.

59
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I thank you.

60
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
And Richard thanks you.

61
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Now may I please say hello?

62
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Hello.

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Hello.

64
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,600
I miss Max and think about him all week long.

65
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,600
We talk about him at dinnertime.

66
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Will you please try to relax?

67
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I've never seen you so wound up.

68
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,600
You seem to be enjoying the pressure.

69
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
The truth is, I am.

70
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
My job is not an easy one,

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
but I really enjoy it.

72
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,600
That is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, Susan.

73
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
What's the problem?

74
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Marilyn's career.

75
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Well, my choice of careers.

76
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Choice?

77
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,600
My career as a fashion designer

78
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
versus my career as a mother.

79
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Why does it have to be one or the other?

80
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
That's what I said.

81
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
How's that?

82
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Why can't you do both?

83
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
She's right.

84
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Both?

85
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Well, that's what I do.

86
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
I have a job, and I have Michelle.

87
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
I take care of both to the best of my ability.

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,600
It's not easy, but what is?

89
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
And that's what I did.

90
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,600
I did both with Richard and Susan,

91
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
and I did both with Robbie.

92
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
I thought you stayed home with Robbie?

93
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
I did.

94
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,600
But I was lucky enough to have a career as a music teacher

95
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
which I could continue at home.

96
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Why can't you work at home, Marilyn?

97
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
You're very talented.

98
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Designing dresses is a career

99
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
you could establish out of your home,

100
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
couldn't you?

101
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,600
I don't know why I didn't think of it.

102
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,600
It seems so simple now.

103
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,600
For a year or two

104
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,600
I could stay at home with Max and do my dress designs.

105
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,600
And you could make your dresses at home.

106
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Sounds like a great way to solve the problem.

107
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,600
That could solve your problem, Marilyn.

108
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm going to call Rita Mae at home

109
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
and ask her to come by and talk about it.

110
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,600
She wants to see Max, anyway.

111
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
I think that really answers your questions, Marilyn.

112
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
You can do it.

113
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Do your designs at home - here.

114
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,600
And let Rita Mae do the selling at the boutique.

115
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,600
And you can both benefit financially.

116
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
I'm going to call Rita Mae right now.

117
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Oh, Susan, thank you so much

118
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,600
for coming all this way from the city to talk to me about it.

119
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
I hope you don't mind

120
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
having taken so much time away from your busy schedule.

121
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Are you kidding?

122
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
I don't mind at all.

123
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
As a matter of fact,

124
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,600
I came to spend some time with my favorite nephew.

125
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
I think you should call Rita Mae right now.

126
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,600
I think your idea of working at home is perfect.

127
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
I don't know what I would do without you.

128
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,600
I'm lucky to have you all.

129
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
We are lucky to have you, Marilyn.

130
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,600
And so is Max.
