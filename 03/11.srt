1
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,600
OK, Richard. That's terrific.

2
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,600
Your pressure is 120 over 75, and that's fine.

3
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Now stand up, please.

4
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Good, it's 122 over 80.

5
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
You can sit down now.

6
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,600
When was your last complete physical?

7
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Six months ago.

8
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Good. Do you have any back or knee problems?

9
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Nope. I am in perfect health.

10
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
What do you do for a living, Mr. Stewart?

11
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
I'm a photographer.

12
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Interesting. What do you photograph?

13
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Everything. The American scene. People, places, events.

14
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Did you ever think of photographing an aerobics class?

15
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,600
No...I can't remember taking pictures of people exercising.

16
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,600
But don't you think it'd be a good subject?

17
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Sure.

18
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,600
I need some good photos for my advertising, Mr. Stewart.

19
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Maybe you can photogragh a class,

20
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
and I can give you and Mrs. Stewart

21
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
a month of classes ree.

22
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
When can I photograph a class?

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Anytime.

24
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
How about today?

25
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Terrific!

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Hi.

27
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Oh, hi.

28
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Oh, hi.

29
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Are we ready to go?

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Yeah. Yeah. Let's get in our lines.

31
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
We're going to take it slow first.

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Stretch up...and we're going to go left first ...

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:54,600
2,3,4 ... now switch. ... 2 3 4

34
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
OK, hold to the right.

35
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Sunrises. Stretch it out. Flat back.

36
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Bring it up ... and twists ... and side ... 2, 3 ...

37
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:27,600
and left ... push ... push ... turn ... hit the floor.

38
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Take it side again .... OK, and switch. Stretch it out.

39
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
And we're going to warm down with a tango.

40
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Left, right. Enjoy it.

41
00:03:50,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Richard, did you go to the Davis Aerobics class today? Richard

42
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Yes, I went to the aerobics class today.

43
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,600
What is wrong with you?

44
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Nothing. I am in excellent health.

45
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
I have ideal blood pressure. A perfect heart.

46
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,600
In other words, I'm in wonderful condition.

47
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Richard, did you go to the aerobics class, really? Richard

48
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
And don't forget to invite Susan for dinner.

49
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
And your legs don't hurt?

50
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Hurt? What do you mean?

51
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,600
What about your arms? Lift your arms up like this.

52
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,600
And they don't hurt not even a little?

53
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Nope.

54
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:56,600
You are in great condition. I can't believe it!
