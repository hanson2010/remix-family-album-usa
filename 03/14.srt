1
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,600
This is really neat!

2
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
When do we eat?

3
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,600
First, we have to catch some fish.

4
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,600
In order to catch fish, you have to do this.

5
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Here we go.

6
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,600
That's it.

7
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,600
Then drop it into the water.

8
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,600
All of this comes before eating. OK?

9
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,600
How do you know so much about fishing?

10
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Grandpa taught me.

11
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
We spent a lot of time fishing together.

12
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Now, the important thing is to get the hook close to the fish.

13
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
All right?

14
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Like this.

15
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:51,600
I think I see some fish right under us, Dad.

16
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Oh, not a chance!

17
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,600
I just saw a big one!

18
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Hi, there!

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Hi.

20
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
What's your name?

21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Albert. Albert

22
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Are you all alone?

23
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
How old are you, Albert?

25
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
I'm ten.

26
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Where's your father?

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
He's up there at the lodge.

28
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Does he know you're here?

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Yes, sir.

30
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,600
OK, Robbie, maybe you should watch him. Robbie

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
The water's pretty deep here.

32
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
I'll watch him, Dad.

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:33,600
What time is it?

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,600
It's almost lunchtime, and no fish yet.

35
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,600
I can go up to the lodge for some hot dogs and drinks.

36
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
No way!

37
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
We're here to catch our lunch.

38
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,600
To catch fish, you need the right magic.

39
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
That's right.

40
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
I forgot!

41
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
The right magic.

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Do it for Robbie, Dad.

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
You remember?

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Sure. Come on.

45
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Well, first, you have to turn your hat around like this.

46
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Then you close your eyes and say the magic words.

47
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Fish, fish, send me a fish.

48
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Fish, fish, send me a fish.... I got one!

49
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
See, it works!

50
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
It's a big one!

51
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Well, it always worked for me, too.

52
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Grandpa, get the net, please!

53
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Dad, you got one, too!

54
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
You bet I have!

55
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Easy, Philip, easy.

56
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Sorry, Dad.

57
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Well, one more and I've got a pair of boots.

58
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,600
You didn't say the magic words.

59
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Robbie's right. Robbie

60
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Yes, but you did, and we've got our lunch.

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Let's build a fire and cook it!

62
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Come on, Albert, you can help us!

63
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
I want to stay here and fish.

64
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,600
All right, but be careful.

65
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Is it finished yet?

66
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
I think so.

67
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
I hope you like your fish well done.

68
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Burned, you mean.

69
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Hey, I'm a doctor, not a chef.

70
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Help! Help! I can't swim!

71
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Dad! Grandpa! He fell in!

72
00:04:45,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Easy does it, Robbie.

73
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
That a boy.

74
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
That's it.

75
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
He's not breathing, Philip!

76
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Robbie, run to the car! Robbie

77
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Bring a blanket and my medical bag.

78
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Yes, Dad.

79
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Now, come on, son. Come on, son.

80
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Breathe, Albert!
