1
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,600
Here are the fliers, hot off the press!

2
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,600
Looks good.

3
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,600
Simple.

4
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,600
Right over here, Grandpa.

5
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
You fold the fliers.

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,600
Richard and I will put them into the envelopes.

7
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
We finished addressing over three hundred envelopes.

8
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
Need another box?

9
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Good work, gang.

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Hi, this is Mike Johnson.

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs. Anderson?

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Mr. Nelson.

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,600
Hi. This is Robbie Stewart.

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Did you know

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,600
my mother is running for the school board?

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Yes, Miss Kim, Ellen Stewart.

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,600
"She cares."

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Oh, see you at the polls.

19
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
Certainly.

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,600
I'll give her your best wishes,

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
Mr. Nelson. Nelson

22
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Hi, this is Mike Johnson.

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs. Burns?

24
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Thank you.

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,600
We have done so much

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,600
in such a short amount of time.

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
I can't believe it!

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Wait till Philip comes home and sees our progress.

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Everyone saw the story in the Riverdale newspaper.

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
Mr. Maxwell was very kind

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
to print my announcement.

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,600
It helps enormously.

33
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Everybody in Riverdale reads his paper.

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Your photo in it helped, too.

35
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Thanks to you, Richard,

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
it's a good picture.

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Well, hi, all.

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Hi, Dad.

39
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Hello, darling.

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
May I... may I help?

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Licking envelopes.

42
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
I fold the fliers.

43
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
We stuff them.

44
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,600
And I lick the envelopes.

45
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Hey, everybody,

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Mrs. Greenberg is on the phone.

47
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
She says Carter Boswell is on the TV right now -

48
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
doing a commercial.

49
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
What channel?

50
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Five.

51
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:22,600
And if you ask what I care about, I'll tell you.

52
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,600
I care about the school buildings in need of paint.

53
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
I care about more lockers for the teachers.

54
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,600
I care about new fixtures in the hallways,

55
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
not music or dancing or entertainment.

56
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,600
I care about the practical things.

57
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,600
If you do, vote for me, Carter Boswell.

58
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,600
A lot of people will agree with him.

59
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,600
I told you.

60
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Too bad kids can't vote.

61
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
It's our school, but we can't vote.

62
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,600
There are people in favor of the cultural programs, Mom.

63
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
There are, Ellen.

64
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Don't be upset by Boswell's commercial.

65
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,600
You have to go on television, too.

66
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Boswell's a powerful speaker.

67
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,600
You can be, too.

68
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Your ideas are good ones.

69
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,600
I don't know.

70
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,600
I'm not sure I'm up to it.
