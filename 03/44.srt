1
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,600
Right this way, Mr. and Mrs. Stewart.

2
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Well, it's small, but clean.

3
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,600
Clean? You call this clean?

4
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Have a nice stay.

5
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,600
Thank you. I don't believe this.

6
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Well, it isn't the Watermill Inn,

7
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,600
but let's get a look at the view.

8
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:40,600
How is the view?

9
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Great,

10
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,600
if you enjoy looking at a parking lot.

11
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Well, maybe we'll see the view in the morning.

12
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Right now, we should clean up this room.

13
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Sorry, Marilyn.

14
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Why should you be sorry?

15
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Well, the rain, the room, the view of the parking lot.

16
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,600
It isn't the way I hoped it would be.

17
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Stop blaming yourself.

18
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,600
After all, we're here, we're alone, we're together.

19
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,600
And I love you. Isn't that enough?

20
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
It is for me,

21
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
but I wanted this weekend to be special for you.

22
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:47,600
It is special. Happy anniversary.

23
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:55,600
It's still raining. I want to play tennis.

24
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
I want some breakfast.

25
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Let's call room service and order a nice breakfast,

26
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
and then we'll figure out what to do today.

27
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Right. Would you give me room service, please?

28
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:18,600
I beg your pardon? Oh, I see.

29
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:25,600
They don't have room service at Old Country Inn. Old Country Inn

30
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Well, let's go down to the coffee shop.

31
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,600
They don't have a coffee shop.

32
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,600
We can get our meals at Mrs. Montefiore's down the road.

33
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,600
That's OK, honey.

34
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,600
I love walking in the rain.

35
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Oh, you're being a really good sport about this, Marilyn,

36
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
but I think we should face the truth.

37
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
What's that?

38
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,600
This is not the way to spend our fifth anniversary.

39
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Well, what do you want to do?

40
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Why don't we get in the car and drive home?

41
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Oh, Richard, it really isn't that bad.

42
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Do you want to stick it out for the whole weekend?

43
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Well, I'll admit the room is uncomfortable.

44
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Uh-hum.

45
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,600
And I do feel bad about your mother

46
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
having to take care of the baby all weekend.

47
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Why don't we just check out?

48
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
OK.

49
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Hello? Yes. Yes, this is she.

50
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Oh, hello! How nice of you to remember us!

51
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Yes, my husband did call.

52
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:45,600
You do? Really? It won't be any trouble?

53
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Oh, yes, I think we'd like that very much.

54
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Fifteen minutes! Thank you. Good-bye.

55
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,600
You will never guess.

56
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Uh ... I give up.

57
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Mrs. Montefiore from the Watermill Inn.

58
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
What is she calling about?

59
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
They have an opening.

60
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Someone just checked out.

61
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,600
and Mrs. Montefiore has reserved the honeymoon suite for us.

62
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
You're kidding!

63
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
No. Isn't it wonderful?

64
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
It's fantastic!

65
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Oh. Now all it has to do is stop raining.

66
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Let's go.
