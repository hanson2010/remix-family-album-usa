1
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
There is a way, Malcolm.

2
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,600
We get our friends to roll their sleeves up and get to work.

3
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
It's certainly a good idea.

4
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
If I could take a look at the place,

5
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,600
I could probably tell what it requires to fix it up.

6
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,600
How much paint, how many hours of work...

7
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,600
That's what I came to ask you to do, Malcolm.

8
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,600
If you would supervise the refurbishing,

9
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,600
I'll find the people to help do it.

10
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
I'll help too, Mr. Baker.

11
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,600
I can get some of my friends to go around the neighborhood

12
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,600
and collect the furniture we need.

13
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,600
I'll help.

14
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Tomorrow. Yes. We'll meet tomorrow morning, right here.

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Can we help?

16
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
I'd really like to.

17
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Sure.

18
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
We might need you to come through with your friends, Robbie.

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Not just to go around the neighborhood asking for furniture,

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
but to help with the paint job.

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,600
That's backbreaking work and may be too much for us.

22
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,600
I'll do it. I'll talk to them.

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,600
And tomorrow morning we'll all meet here to discuss the plan?

24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Tomorrow morning it is.

25
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Come in, come in. Please, come in.

26
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:36,600
I'd like you to meet my friend Malcolm Stewart.

27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Malcolm, this is Joanne Thompson.

28
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Hello, Joanne. Nice to meet you.

29
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
My pleasure, Malcolm.

30
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,600
And this is Abe Lucas. You must remember Abe.

31
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
He ran the drugstore

32
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,600
and used to play drums with the jazz band on weekends.

33
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Oh, sure I do. Hi, Abe.

34
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Hello, Mr. Stewart.

35
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Malcolm, please.

36
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Hello, Malcolm.

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Sit down, sit down. Have some coffee.

38
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,600
And I've got some delicious Danish pastry for you.

39
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Where's your grandson Robbie and his friend Alexandra?

40
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Weren't they going to be here this morning?

41
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
I thought so, too.

42
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I'm surprised they're not here.

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Robbie left early this morning to meet Alexandra.

44
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Frankly, I thought they'd be here, but...

45
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
It's OK. I'm sure they meant well,

46
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
but they probably had other things on their minds.

47
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,600
I understand you used to be in the construction business,

48
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Malcolm.

49
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
I was, indeed.

50
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,600
I wonder if you would take a look at the old library

51
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,600
and make sure that it is in good condition

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,600
so that we don't have to worry about any structural problems.

53
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
When can I do that? I'd be happy to.

54
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
We've got permission to go inside the old building

55
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
during the week -

56
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Tuesday or Wednesday.

57
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,600
That's fine with me. I can do it either day.

58
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
That would be very helpful.

59
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,600
I think the building just needs a good cleaning.

60
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
And a good paint job.

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Then we have to furnish it.

62
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,600
I wish Robbie and Alexandra had come to this meeting.

63
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,600
They had some ideas about getting the place fixed up.

64
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Perhaps they'll show up. In the meantime,

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
let me give you some additional thoughts and ideas I have.

66
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
OK.

67
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Go ahead, Joanne.

68
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,600
As I said, mostly the building just needs a good cleaning.

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
This place can be developed

70
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,600
with one real intergenerational program.

71
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
That's an idea I like.

72
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
A community center

73
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,600
with the kinds of programs that fit everyone.

74
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
And programs that don't leave anyone out.

75
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
It's asking a lot.

76
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,600
But we can't do it without talking to the young people.

77
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Finding out what they want.

78
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,600
If only Robbie and Alexandra were here.

79
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Don't be upset, Malcolm.

80
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
We'll have a chance to talk to them later.

81
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
It's not like Robbie.

82
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,600
If he says he's going to be here, he's here.

83
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,600
I wonder what the problem is.
