1
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,000
I had an interview today, too.

2
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I had a great interview

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,600
with Admissions at Columbia University.

4
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
Really?

5
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
What did they say?

6
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
Will you get into the school?

7
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Well, they didn't say anything for sure.

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,600
But I figure that with my grades and with my personality,

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,600
I'll have no problem.

10
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Columbia's a terrific school. Columbia

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,600
What are you going to do?

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Do? I don't know.

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
I also applied to NYU.

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,600
You sound excited about Columbia.

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,600
What's your problem, Mike?

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,600
Indecision. Indecision.

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,600
It's not easy,

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
and this is an important decision we have to make.

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
What about you?

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
How was your interview with Michigan?

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
The interview was fine.

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
It's a great college.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
It is.

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
My father would like me to go there.

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
He and my Grandpa both went there.

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
Great medical school, too.

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
I know.

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
You can follow in your father's footsteps.

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Ah! I'd like to follow in my own footsteps, Mike.

30
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
What do you want to study?

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
I've been thinking.

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
I think I want to study journalism

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,600
to be a reporter--a newspaperman.

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,600
You do a pretty good job on the Riverdale High School paper.

35
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,600
And I've been thinking about it a lot lately.

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Have you discussed it with your parents?

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,600
No. But I have to.

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
OK. Let's talk.

39
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Hi, Son. Is everything all right?

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Hi, Dad. Everything's fine.

41
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,600
I was just waiting for you to get home

42
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
so we could talk.

43
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Anything special you want to talk about?

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
There is, Dad.

45
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
I'm listening.

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Well, I know you and Mom have given up a lot

47
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,600
to save money for my college tuition.

48
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
We want you to go to college, Robbie.

49
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
I know. I do.

50
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
But?

51
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Well, I've thought a lot about which college,

52
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,600
and one of them is Columbia.

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Columbia? Why Columbia? Columbia

54
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,600
First, they have an excellent School of Journalism.

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,600
They do.

56
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,600
And your friends are planning to go to Columbia?

57
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
That's only part of it.

58
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,600
It's complicated.

59
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,600
I'll try to explain.

60
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Mike and I had a hamburger this afternoon, and we talked.

61
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Yes?

62
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Well, we talked about a lot of things.

63
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
He applied to Columbia,

64
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
and his interview was very successful.

65
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
He thinks he'll be accepted,

66
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
and he really wants to go there.

67
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Dean Rafer called me today. Rafer

68
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,600
He told me he was very impressed with you.

69
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
He's a nice man.

70
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
He was very kind.

71
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
He told me

72
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,600
you had some doubts about wanting to go to Michigan.

73
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Yes. I do.

74
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,600
I'm just not sure about what I want to do.

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
That's OK.

76
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,600
You understand?

77
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Let me tell you something, Robbie.

78
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Something that might be surprising to you.

79
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
What? Tell me.

80
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Well, Grandpa wanted me to study engineering, like him.

81
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Well, I wasn't clear about my future,

82
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,600
but I knew engineering was not for me.

83
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,600
What did you tell Grandpa?

84
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
The truth.

85
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Then you're not upset

86
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
about my not wanting to go into medicine?

87
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,600
I'm not upset at all.

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,600
I'm just happy that we're able to talk about it.

89
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
I am too, Dad.

90
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,600
I suppose you want to apply to Columbia.

91
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Yes, but I also want to apply to several other colleges.

92
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,600
I thought you wanted to go to Columbia.

93
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Well, I might want to go to Columbia.

94
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
But I might not.

95
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,600
I just want to be able to make my own decision.

96
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,600
You're a real Stewart!

97
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,600
And if I think about it long enough, you never know ...

98
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Never know what?

99
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
If I make my own decision,

100
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,600
I might choose Michigan.

101
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Robbie, you're something! Robbie

102
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,600
You know, when I was your age,

103
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,600
I said exactly the same thing to Grandpa.
