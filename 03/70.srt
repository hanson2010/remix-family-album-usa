1
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Hi, Mom.

2
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Hi, Robbie.

3
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
You're home from school early.

4
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Yeah, they're getting the assembly hall

5
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
ready for the graduation ceremony,

6
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
so we all got to go home early.

7
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Too noisy to study.

8
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Well, now that you're here,

9
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
you can help me with dinner.

10
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I need those potatoes peeled and sliced.

11
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Mom, give me a break.

12
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Alexandra's coming over to help me study for my math final

13
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Well, in that case,

14
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
you can wash the dishes and clean up after dinner.

15
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Can I invite Alexandra to stay for dinner?

16
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Of course.

17
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Thanks, Mom.

18
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,600
You and Alexandra

19
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
have become good friends, haven't you?

20
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Yes. I like her.

21
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
She's a terrific person.

22
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I'm going to miss her

23
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
when she goes back to Greece.

24
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Would you like to give her a little farewell party?

25
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Mom, that would be terrific!

26
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Maybe we could make it a surprise.

27
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Oh, I don't know.

28
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Surprise parties don't always work out.

29
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Well, we could tell her

30
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
it's a graduation party for me.

31
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
When Alexandra arrives,

32
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
we'll surprise her.

33
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Well, I suppose that might work.

34
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,600
I'd like to give her a nice going-away present.

35
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Fine.

36
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
There's only one problem.

37
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
What's that?

38
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I'm broke.

39
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
I should have saved some money.

40
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
I'm sure Alexandra

41
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
would be happy with something simple, Robbie.

42
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
I know.

43
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
But, well,

44
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
I'd like to give her something nice

45
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
to remember me by.

46
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Maybe I could borrow some money from you and Dad.

47
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
It's all right with me

48
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
if it's all right with your dad.

49
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Thanks, Mom.

50
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
I'll talk to him.

51
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Is he still in his office?

52
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
I think so.

53
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Thanks, Mom.

54
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Robbie! Good luck! Robbie

55
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Here are the X-rays you wanted, Dr. Stewart.

56
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Oh. Thank you, Molly.

57
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Now, let me check them.

58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
What do you think?

59
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
I don't see any breaks or fractures.

60
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Well, well. Thank you, Molly.

61
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Thank you.

62
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Come in!

63
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Hi, Son.

64
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Hi, Dad. Am I interrupting you?

65
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
No, no, no, no.

66
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
What's up?

67
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Can we talk?

68
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Sure.

69
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
I need some help.

70
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Well, that's what fathers are for.

71
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Well, before I go to college,

72
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
I have the whole summer ...

73
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Yes ...

74
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,500
And I'm planning to get a job for the summer.

75
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
And what sort of job?

76
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
I applied for a job as a lifeguard at the community pool.

77
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Sounds pretty good.

78
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Yes. I'll be earning pretty good money if I get it.

79
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
But right now, I'm kind of short of cash.

80
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Who isn't?

81
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,600
And my friend Alexandra is going back to Greece ...

82
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Nice girl.

83
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
We'll all miss her.

84
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Mom says we can give her a going-away surprise party.

85
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Good idea.

86
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,600
And I'd like to get her a nice gift ...

87
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
What'd you have in mind?

88
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,200
Well, a wristwatch,

89
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,600
so she'll think of me when she looks at the time.

90
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Nothing flashy or expensive.

91
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Something simple--but a good one.

92
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Sounds fine, Robbie.

93
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Well, I saw a nice watch.

94
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
But I'll need a loan.

95
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
If you could lend me the money,

96
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,600
I could pay you back out of my lifeguard salary.

97
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Well, I guess your mother and I can manage it.

98
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,600
When do you need the money?

99
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Would tomorrow be OK?

100
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,600
You've got it.

101
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Thanks, Dad.

102
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
My pleasure, Son.

103
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Oh, and, Robbie ...

104
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Yes?

105
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,600
You'll probably want the family car

106
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,600
so you can drive her home after the party.

107
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Could I?

108
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:19,400
If you drive carefully.

109
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,600
I will. Thanks, Dad.

110
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,600
My pleasure.

111
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
You're OK, Dad.

112
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,600
You're not so bad yourself, Son.
