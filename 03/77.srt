1
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Do you like the dress?

2
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
I love it.

3
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,600
I designed it myself.

4
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,600
It's beautiful.

5
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
Are you ready?

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
We're supposed to be there

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
before the guests arrive.

8
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
I know. I know.

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Help me with this tie, will you?

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
Honey, I'm scared to death.

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,600
But this is what you've been working for all these years.

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
No, no.

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
I worked to put together a book of photographs.

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
This is show business.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,600
Well, it's all part of the same job.

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Just relax and enjoy it.

17
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,600
You're right.

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,600
I earned this, and I'm going to enjoy it.

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,600
As soon as I recover from my nervous breakdown.

20
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,600
What are you afraid of?

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
Everything.

22
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
A critic was there this morning.

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
He probably hates my work.

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,600
I have to sign copies of my book for a lot of people

25
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
I never met before.

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,600
My new shoes hurt my feet...

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:58,600
You're going to be a great success.

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Are you ready?

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
As soon as I get these cuff links on.

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Let me help.

31
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Mom and Dad are already on their way down to the gallery.

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:20,600
There! You look very attractive.

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Thank you.

34
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Well, I suppose I've run out of excuses.

35
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Mm-hmm. Let's go...

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Oh, one minute.

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Before we go to the gallery,

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
I just want to tell you

39
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
that I never could have done this book

40
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
without your help and your love.

41
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
I appreciate it.

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Thanks.

43
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Now, no more stalling.

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
What is it?

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
There's nobody here!

46
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Of course not, Richard.

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Your show doesn't begin until eight thirty.

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Oh. Right.

49
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Richard! Welcome! Good luck tonight!

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Well, thanks.

51
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
This is my publisher, Harvey Carlson.

52
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
You've met my wife Marilyn...

53
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Charmed.

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
My mother, Ellen Stewart.

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Harvey Carlson.

56
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
It's good to meet you.

57
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
This is my father, Dr. Philip Stewart...

58
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Nice to meet you, Mr. Carlson.

59
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
My brother Robbie...

60
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Hi.

61
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Hi.

62
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,600
And this is my sister Susan and her husband Harry Bennett

63
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
and his daughter Michelle.

64
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
It's nice to meet you.

65
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,600
And this gentleman is my grandfather, Malcolm Stewart.

66
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Welcome, Mr. Stewart.

67
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Well, make yourselves comfortable.

68
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
There are hors d'oeuvres at the table, fruit punch at the bar.

69
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Help yourselves.

70
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Can I get you something, Mr. Stewart?

71
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
No, thank you.

72
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
You can feel very proud of your grandson, Mr. Stewart.

73
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I do.

74
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
I'm proud of all my grandchildren, Mr. Carlson.

75
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Of course.

76
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Feel free to look around.

77
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
If you need anything, just ask.

78
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Thank you.

79
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Harvey? Harvey

80
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Yes?

81
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Did Mitchell Johnson's review come out yet?

82
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Not yet.

83
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
The newspapers don't come out till about ten o'clock.

84
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
When they come out, we'll get it.

85
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Thanks.

86
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Ready?

87
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Yes. Have the people arrived?

88
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
The guests are waiting.

89
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Tom's about to open the doors.

90
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Good luck! And stop worrying!

91
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
They're going to love it.
