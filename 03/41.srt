1
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,600
Oh, Daddy!

2
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,600
We had such a good time at the aquarium.

3
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
I saw a real shark.

4
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,600
I could almost touch it.

5
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,600
I'm so glad.

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,600
Hi. Michelle,

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
why don't you introduce everybody to Susan?

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
Hi, Susan.

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,600
I'd like you to meet Audrey and her mother, Mrs. Cooper.

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
Hello, Audrey.

11
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Cooper.

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
I'm Susan Stewart.

13
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,600
And this is Shirley and Nicole.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Hi, girls.

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Come on in.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Come on in, Mrs. Cooper.

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Come on in, everybody.

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
The aquarium was so exciting.

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
I had never been there before.

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
The girls learned a great deal.

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,600
Frankly, so did I.

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Well, please sit down

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,600
and tell us all about it during lunch.

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,600
We prepared some tuna fish

25
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,600
and cheese sandwiches for lunch.

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,600
I love tuna fish.

27
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Don't you, Audrey?

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,600
I remember when I used to be a Girl Scout.

29
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
My mother would take us everywhere, too.

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,600
Susan, I understand you're in the toy business.

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
Yes, I am.

32
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,600
My company manufactures toys and games for children.

33
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Susan's vice-president in charge of new toys and games.

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
And the marketing of new toys and games.

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Can we test a new game for you, Susan?

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
That's an excellent idea, Michelle.

37
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
I happen to have

38
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
a game which I brought home to study.

39
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Let us try it!

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Do you want to play?

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Nicole? Shirley? Audrey?

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,600
We tested it last week on twelve- to fifteen-year-olds,

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,600
and they found it to be too easy

44
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
in other words... boring.

45
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,600
We think it might be just right for ten- to twelve-year-olds.

46
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
That's us, Susan.

47
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
First, you shuffle the deck

48
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,600
and lay them face down.

49
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Then you select the leader.

50
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
I'll be the leader.

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,600
The leader takes the first ten cards

52
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
and lays them face up on this stand.

53
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:50,600
h-t-e-r-c-z-e-p-e-s.

54
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Everyone gets a turn, going counterclockwise,

55
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
left to right.

56
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,600
You have thirty seconds to make a word,

57
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
using as many letters as possible.

58
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,600
You get one point for each letter,

59
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,600
plus the person with the longest word gets ten extra points.

60
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,600
The first one to get one hundred points wins.

61
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
That's easy.

62
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
OK, let's go around the table.

63
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
You first, Audrey.

64
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Chest - c-h-e-s-t.

65
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Good.

66
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
That's five points.

67
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Next, Nicole.

68
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Three - t-h-r-e-e.

69
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
OK.

70
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
That's five points also.

71
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
It's your turn, Shirley.

72
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Creep - c-r-e-e-p.

73
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Creep.

74
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
That's another five-letter word.

75
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Five points.

76
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
So far, you're all tied.

77
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Sheet - s-h-e-e-t.

78
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Sheet is a five-letter word.

79
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Michelle, your turn.

80
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Cheese - c-h-e-e-s-e.

81
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Terrific!

82
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Michelle wins with a six-letter word,

83
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
plus she gets an additional ten points

84
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
for a total of sixteen points.

85
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
How are you enjoying the game so far?

86
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
I think it's too easy.

87
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Too easy?

88
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Michelle!

89
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
It's OK, Harry.

90
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Michelle is quite right.

91
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
She just said it's too easy.

92
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Well, I like the game.

93
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
I enjoyed lunch, Susan.

94
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Thank you so much,

95
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
but we have to get going

96
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
to meet the rest of the troop at two o'clock at the museum.

97
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Oh, it was nice meeting all of you.

98
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,600
I hope you have a wonderful time

99
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
at the Museum of Natural History.

100
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Good-bye, everybody.

101
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Have a good time.

102
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Bye.

103
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
See you in front of the museum at five o'clock.

104
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Oh, OK.

105
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Thanks, Mr. Bennett.

106
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
That'll be fine.

107
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
And thanks again for the lunch and for the game.

108
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Good-bye, Susan.

109
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
It's not a bad game.

110
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
It's just ... slow.

111
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Just slow.

112
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,600
You helped save our company a lot of money.

113
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Bye-bye.

114
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:41,600
You are wonderful with kids.

115
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
I am.

116
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Isn't there a conversation that we have to finish?
