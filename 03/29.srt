00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,600
Hi, Michelle.

2
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,600
Hello, Harry.

3
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
It's nice to see you again.

4
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Hello.

5
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
Hi, Susan.

6
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,600
We have both been excited about seeing you

7
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
and having lunch with you today.

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Michelle picked these flowers out for you.

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Daddy, can we go soon?

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,600
We're going to go to lunch in a few minutes, honey.

11
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,600
But I'm thirsty.

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,600
OK. You go out and get a drink of water at the fountain.

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
The fountain is over there, Michelle.

14
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Near the Exit sign.

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Thank you.

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Michelle is a little shy.

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,600
I used to be that way when I was her age.

18
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Harry, if Michelle doesn't want to go,

19
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
we don't have to.

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
She'll be fine.

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Remember,

22
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,600
I haven't dated any one else since her mother died.

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,600
This is a little difficult for her.

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Are you ready to go?

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Yes. But could you wait one minute?

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
I have a call to make.

27
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Would you excuse me?

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Sam, get Mr. Levine at Toytown Stores

29
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
on the telephone for me, please.

30
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Right.

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Hello. Susan Stewart calling Mr. Levine, please.

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
He's on the phone.

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Mr. Levine, Susan Stewart.

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,600
I find myself in an embarrassing situation.

35
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,600
I made another lunch date for today

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
and forgot to enter it in my appointment book.

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Can you and I meet for drinks tomorrow?

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,600
I'd really appreciate it... Yes... Thank you...

39
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Tomorrow at five o'clock at the Biltmore.

40
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
I'll see you then.

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Thank you, Mr. Levine.

42
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Welcome to the South Street restaurant, folks.

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
What'll it be?

44
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
What do you recommend?

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Well, the crab salad's always a big hit.

46
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Susan, would you like the crab salad?

47
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
I'd love the crab salad.

48
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Michelle, would you like to try the crab salad, too?

49
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
OK, Daddy.

50
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
We'll have three crab salads

51
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
and a pitcher of lemonade.

52
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Help yourself to celery and carrots and other vegetables.

53
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
We used to catch crabs.

54
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Where was that?

55
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
We had a summer house on Fire Island.

56
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Do you remember, Michelle?

57
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Sure.

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
You and Mommy used to take me on the ferryboat.

59
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Sometimes, at night,

60
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
we would go down to the beach and catch crabs,

61
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
remember?

62
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
With a piece of meat on a string!

63
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Right.

64
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Well, I think I'm going to go get us all some vegetables.

65
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
There you go.

66
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Thank you.

67
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:16,600
And some ice-cold lemonade.

68
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Thank you.

69
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Enjoy it.

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Michelle, can I help you with the lemonade?

71
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
No, thank you.

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
I'll wait for my father.

73
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Michelle, can we have a talk?

74
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Sure.

75
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
I know you miss your mother.

76
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
You do?

77
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Yes. And I'm not trying to take her place.

78
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Then why are you and Daddy

79
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
spending so much time together?

80
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Because we like each other.

81
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,600
And right now, he needs a friend.

82
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
I'm his friend.

83
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
I know you are.

84
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Sometimes he's very sad.

85
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,600
And so are you, I think.

86
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Sometimes.

87
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
I'd like to be your friend, too.

88
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Will you let me be your friend, Michelle?

89
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:20,600
So, what were you two talking about?

90
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Just girl talk, Daddy.

91
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
It's too hard to explain.

92
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
You're probably right.

93
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Well, let's get started.
