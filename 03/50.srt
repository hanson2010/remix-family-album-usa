1
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Good morning.

2
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,600
Good morning. My name is Richard Stewart.

3
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,600
I'm here to see Mr. Carlson.

4
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,600
Please sit down, Mr. Stewart.

5
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,600
Mr. Carlson will be with you shortly.

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,600
Thank you.

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,600
Excuse me, Mr. Carlson,

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
but Richard Stewart is here

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
for his ten o'clock appointment with you.

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
OK. Thank you.

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
Like I said, he'll be with you shortly.

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Thank you.

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Yes, Mr. Carlson. Yes, sir.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,600
He's ready for you, Mr. Stewart.

15
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Thank you. In there?

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Yes. In there. Good luck.

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Come in, come in.

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,600
This is a crazy morning. Hello, Richard.

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Hello, Mr. Carlson.

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Sit down, sit down.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
I hope you've brought your pictures along.

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
I see that you have. Let's get right to it.

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,600
We need a new coffee-table book,

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,600
and a book of photos about the United States still feels right.

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
OK, let's take a look.

27
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Good. Very good. Family Album, U.S.A.

28
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
It's an excellent title.

29
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,600
If you had to describe the book in one sentence,

30
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
how would you do it?

31
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Well, I'd describe it as a book which is a...

32
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,600
a portrait of the United States -

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,600
the places, the people, mostly the people.

34
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,600
The things they do, the ways they live,

35
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
the places they visit, and the landmarks.

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
A photographic journey.

37
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
These are wonderful.

38
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,600
These photos in your performing arts section.

39
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center.

40
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
I'm glad you like them.

41
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
I do, but...

42
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
But?

43
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,600
There's something missing. You've got a good eye, Richard.

44
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
You're a terrific photographer.

45
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
But before I can publish your work,

46
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I need to meet with my marketing department,

47
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
and you've got to do one more thing.

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,600
What's that, Mr. Carlson?

49
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
In the section on culture,

50
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
you've included performing arts centers,

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
but you've left out street performance.

52
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:30,600
The mimes.

53
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Richard, if you go out

54
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
and photograph street performances in the city,

55
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
you'll have it.

56
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,600
That is a great idea.

57
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,600
The performing arts centers and the street performances.

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I'll do it.

59
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
If you do it, I'll publish your work.

60
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Are you serious?

61
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
I've never been more serious.

62
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
When do you think you can return with street performances?

63
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,600
A couple of weeks.

64
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,600
If they're as good as the rest of these pictures, it's a deal.

65
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,600
You won't be disappointed, Mr. Carlson. Thanks.

66
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Good-bye, Richard, and good luck. See you in two weeks.

67
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Good-bye, Mr. Carlson. Thanks.

68
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:21,600
So if you like the street-performance photos,

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
you'll really publish Family Album, U.S.A.?

70
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,600
When I say something, I mean it.

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Go to work. Good-bye.

72
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Good-bye.
