1
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,600
What are you doing?

2
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,600
I think I've got them.

3
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,600
You think you've got what?

4
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Performing arts... performing arts centers.

5
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
I think I've got them all, but I'm not sure.

6
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I think you have got it, Richard.

7
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Lincoln Center, home of the Metropolitan Opera,

8
00:02:51,600 --> 00:03:02,600
the New York City Ballet, the New York Philharmonic.

9
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Shubert Alley, center of the theater on Broadway.

10
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
And Carnegie Hall.

11
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,600
And the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.

12
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,600
And the Music Center in Los Angeles.

13
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:32,600
And the others. I do have it all.

14
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:40,600
You have been working on this for some time, Richard.

15
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I'm glad you feel you've finally put it all together.

16
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
What now?

17
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Now for the hard part.

18
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Oh, you think you're going to have a hard time

19
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
getting the album published?

20
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Well, it won't be easy.

21
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,600
So, what do you think you're going to do?

22
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Does the name Harvey Carlson ring a bell?

23
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Oh, yes! Harvey Carlson! I remember.

24
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
He said I should call him.

25
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,600
He's the publisher of the Carlson Publishing Company.

26
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
He said they need a new book of photographs,

27
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
and he really liked my concept.

28
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
So, why don't you call him in the morning?

29
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Do you think I have enough to show him?

30
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,600
I've been through every section with you, Richard.

31
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
It's quite complete.

32
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
And now that you're satisfied with the performing arts section,

33
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
I think you should show it to Mr. Carlson.

34
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,600
You're right. My Family Album, U.S.A. feels right.

35
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,600
I'll call in the morning and set up an appointment to see him.

36
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,600
He's going to love your work.

37
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Come on. Let's get some sleep.

38
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Is it too early to call Mr. Carlson?

39
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Seven after nine? No. I'm sure he's in his office.

40
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,600
His number is five, five, five, seven, five, three, two.

41
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Five, five, five, seven, five, three, two.

42
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Hello. Mr. Carlson, please.

43
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Mr. Carlson is busy at the moment. May I help you?

44
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,600
I'd like to make an appointment with him.

45
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
And your name is...?

46
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
My name is Richard Stewart.

47
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
He told me to call him about my project,

48
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Family Album, U.S.A.

49
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
One moment, please.

50
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:55,600
What's going on?

51
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,600
I guess they're trying to set up an appointment for me.

52
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Mr. Stewart, I just spoke to Mr. Carlson. Stewart.

53
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
He would like to see you.

54
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
But the only time he's available this week

55
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
is tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.

56
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Thanks. Thanks a lot. Good-bye.

57
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Well, it's done. Tomorrow morning at a publisher's office.

58
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Oh, it's so exciting, isn't it, Richard?

59
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Well, finally a publisher will see my work.
