00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,600
Ah! Miss Stewart! Welcome!

2
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
How are you?

3
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Fine, Somsak. And you?

4
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Fine, thank you.

5
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
This is my friend Harry Bennett.

6
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,600
Pleased to meet you.

7
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Very nice to meet you.

8
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,600
Any friend of Miss Stewart's is welcome at Somsak's.

9
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Follow me, please.

10
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,600
I like it here.

11
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,600
I do, too. I come here often.

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,600
A special place for special people.

13
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Thank you, Somsak.

14
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Well! Nice restaurant.

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,600
Would you like something to drink?

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Yes, I'd like a glass of ginger ale with ice.

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Harry, what would you like?

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Do you have a dry white wine?

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
How about a California chablis?

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Chablis is fine.

21
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
What would you like to eat?

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,600
I'd like the mee krob.

23
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Harry, would you like to see a menu?

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
No, it's Ok.

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,600
I'll have the mee krob also.

26
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,600
What is it?

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Crispy fried noodles. I love them.

28
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
May I bring you a salad?

29
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Oh yes.

30
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
What do you recommend today?

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
I recommend rose-petal salad.

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Special for new friends.

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Rose-petal salad?

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Why not?

35
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
I'll take care of everything.

36
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,600
I hope you're hungry.

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,600
What? Oh, yes. Starving. Well, I...

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Well, I...

39
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,600
What do you do at Universe Toy Company?

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I'm the vice-president of new toy development.

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Terrific!

42
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,600
I know you're a CPA.

43
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
That's true. Harry Bennett,

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
certified public accountant.

45
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
I love numbers.

46
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
I do some work for Smith and Dale,

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Your company's accounting firm.

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
And so...

49
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Here we are.

50
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Yes.

51
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
I have a daughter.

52
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I know. How old is she?

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
She's nine years old.

54
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
That's a nice age. What's her name?

55
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Michelle.

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Do you have a picture of her?

57
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:25,600
She's very pretty.

58
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Thank you.

59
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Rose-petal salad.

60
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,600
And there's a phone call for you, Mr. Bennett.

61
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Excuse me, Susan.

62
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I hope nothing is wrong.

63
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
I'll get the rest of the dinner.

64
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Excuse me.

65
00:03:47,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Please forgive me, Susan, but...

66
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
I have to leave. I feel terrible, but...

67
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
What's the matter?

68
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
My daughter isn't feeling well.

69
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Oh no! Is it serious?

70
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
I don't know. The baby-sitter says she has a stomachache,

71
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
and she's crying.

72
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
I'll have to go home.

73
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Will you forgive me?

74
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Of course. I'm so sorry for Michelle.

75
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,600
And you didn't have a chance to eat.

76
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Oh, it's OK.

77
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Let me take you home first.

78
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
No, no. Please, go ahead.

79
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
It's our first date.

80
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
We'll make another.

81
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Please don't worry.

82
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
I'll phone you.

83
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I hope your daughter is all right. Good-bye.

84
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Good-bye.
