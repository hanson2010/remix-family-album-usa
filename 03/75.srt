1
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,600
I'm so glad everyone is asleep.

2
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,600
I thought Max would be crying, and everybody would be awake.

3
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
What did I tell you?

4
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
Nothing to worry about.

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
I'm sure everything is fine.

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
My mother knows all there is to know

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
about taking care of babies, I assure you.

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
Let's put some of this stuff away and then take off.

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
We've got a forty-minute drive into the city.

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Welcome home,

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,600
and I do mean welcome home.

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,600
Something wrong?

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Oh, nothing's wrong, Richard.

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Believe me, Max is fine.

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,600
But his teeth hurt, and he just can't get to sleep, poor dear.

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,600
Neither can you.

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Oh, I feel so bad.

18
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Oh, I'm fine.

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
How was your weekend?

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,600
We had a great time, Mom.

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
It was wonderful.

22
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
The weather couldn't have been better.

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,600
It was nice here, too.

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Did you get a chance to get outside at all?

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Oh, yes.

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Grandpa helped me yesterday afternoon.

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
I went to the supermarket to get a few things,

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,600
and I stayed out an extra half hour.

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
The village was filled with people. The weather was so nice.

30
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Harry's a professional camper, Mom.

31
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
He knows all there is to know,

32
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
and he made the weekend very easy for us to enjoy.

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Come on. You all helped.

34
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
You were wonderful, Harry!

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Why don't you go to your room, Mom, and get some sleep.

36
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Oh, I'm fine.

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Tell me more about your weekend.

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Did you do anything special?

39
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Lots of special country things.

40
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
We picked flowers.

41
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
And we brought some home for you.

42
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,600
It was so nice to be out in the country.

43
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,600
They smell wonderful.

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Everything smelled so special.

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
It would have been great if we had been able to bottle the smells.

46
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
It would be a great business if you could do that.

47
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Oh!

48
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Uh, we're home now, Ellen.

49
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
We'll take care of it.

50
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
I'll take care of it.

51
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Let's see if it works.

52
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
What's that?

53
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,600
A little special country music.

54
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
I think we'd better head home.

55
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
It's getting late, and we have a bit of a drive.

56
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Well, all your things are inside.

57
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
There's your sleeping bag.

58
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Oh, thanks, Harry.

59
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Say good-bye to Richard.

60
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
We'll call you all tomorrow night.

61
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Good-bye.

62
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Bye, Mom.

63
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:24,600
I'm so tired I think I'm overtired.

64
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,600
I don't know if I can get to sleep.

65
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Max has stopped crying.

66
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Yes. It works!

67
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
It works!

68
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
What works?

69
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
This.

70
00:03:50,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Oh. Oh, where did you get that?

71
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,600
It sounds so nice.

72
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:15,600
I think I'm falling asleep.

73
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Like Max did.

74
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Good night.

75
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Sounds of the country.

76
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
The soothing sounds of the country.
