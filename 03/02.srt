1
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Excuse me, officer. Can you help me?

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,200
Sure.

3
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,000
Can you tell me how to get to Linden Street in Riverdale?

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Richard Stewart, 46 Linden Street, Riverdale, New York.

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You should take the number 1 subway.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Is there a station near here?

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes. The station's that way.

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You should take the number 1 train to Van Cortlandt Park.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Number 1 train to Van Cortlandt Park. Thank you.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Anytime. Good luck.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Remember, the number 1 train. The uptown platform.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Thank you.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You're welcome.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Is this pink too bright for me?

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Mmm-hmm. It is a very bright pink.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Try this. It's size eight.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But I wear size ten.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
How about green? It's size ten.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Let me try it on.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm taking too much of your time.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's six o'clock.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Where's my husband?

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,300
Where's my husband?

24
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,000
I was expecting him here at five forty-five.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Don't worry. The traffic is very heavy at this hour.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I know. But we're going to be late for dinner.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll take this green sweater.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I like the color on me, don't you?

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I think it looks terrific on you.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm sorry I'm so late.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I had a really bad day.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's ten after six. We're late.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Robbie's cooking tonight, and dinner's at six thirty.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I know. I know. I'm really sorry.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I left my bag of film on the ferry.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I went back for it, but the ferry was gone.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I lost a whole day's work.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll call the Staten Island Ferry lost-and-found office.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I didn't think of that. Thanks.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Hello.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes. The number, please,

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
of the Staten Island Ferry lost-and-found office. Staten

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Five five five...zero eight zero eight. 555-

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Thank you.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I really appreciate it, Marilyn.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I really appreciate it, Marilyn.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Hello.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Did anyone find a camera bag this afternoon,

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
a small canvas bag,

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
on the J. F. Kennedy Ferry?...No?

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Maybe someone will find it.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The name is Stewart, Richard Stewart.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And the telephone number is five five five...

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
three oh nine oh. Thank you.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Sorry, Richard. They don't have it.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Thanks, anyway.

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
There was a girl on the ferry.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Now maybe...

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Tell me about it on the way home.
