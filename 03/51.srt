1
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Two weeks. I said I could do it in two weeks, and I did it.

2
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
The pictures you've taken are fabulous, Richard.

3
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Mr. Carlson will love them.

4
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Monday morning.

5
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,600
I'm going to show him the photos on Monday morning.

6
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I can't wait!

7
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:13,600
I'm very proud of you. You really did a beautiful job.

8
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,600
I know he will love the new photographs for your book.

9
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Yeah. I really did do a good job, didn't I?

10
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Hey, you know? There's still some film left on this roll,

11
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
and there's one person I haven't photographed in a long time.

12
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Who?

13
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
You.

14
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Richard! I haven't brushed my hair.

15
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
You look great!

16
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
It's not fair, Richard. I'm not even ready.

17
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Oh, that's wonderful! That's wonderful!

18
00:03:46,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Wonderful!

19
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Thanks.

20
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Fabulous!

21
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Thanks.

22
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Terrific!

23
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Thanks.

24
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
They get better and better.

25
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Thanks a lot.

26
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,600
This is sensational!

27
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Yeah. Thanks.

28
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,600
What a job! Good work, Richard!

29
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
I'm so glad you like them so much.

30
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Like them? They represent your best work.

31
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Really?

32
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Absolutely.

33
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Well... what do you think? Do I have my book?

34
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:59,600
You do. You do. There's a book here.

35
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,600
I'll have a contract

36
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
and an advance payment waiting for you

37
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
first thing in the morning.

38
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Thank you.

39
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
And while you're here,

40
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
I would like to introduce you to your editor.

41
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
And I want you to meet the people in the art department.

42
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
I'll set up an appointment with the marketing people.

43
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
When do you think we'll be through?

44
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,600
In about half an hour. Why?

45
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
I can't wait to tell Marilyn!
