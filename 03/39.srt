1
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,600
Thanks, Michelle.

2
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
I hope you like it.

3
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:52,600
Isn't this baby outfit adorable?

4
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,600
With his name on it - "Max".

5
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Thanks so much, Harry and Michelle.

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,600
We really appreciate it.

7
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
I'm glad you like it.

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Michelle picked it out.

9
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
Yes, I told Daddy to pick blue ones.

10
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Blue is for boys, and pink is for girls.

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,600
And Max is some boy.

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,600
He's a real Stewart.

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Right.

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,600
That was so thoughtful of you, Michelle.

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Especially to pick it out in blue.

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,600
Would you like to see baby Max, Michelle?

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Could she? Could we?

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Could I?

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Take them upstairs, Susan.

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Harry and Michelle can watch Max sleeping.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Let's go.

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Come on, Michelle.

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Before Max wakes up.

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Will you please take this upstairs, Susan?

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Uh-huh.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Thank you.

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Michelle is very grown up for a ten-year-old, huh?

28
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,600
She's smart and sensitive for her age.

29
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Growing up without a mother is difficult.

30
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,600
You mature quickly.

31
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Susan's like a mother to Michelle.

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
They have a good relationship.

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Do you think Susan and Harry will get married?

34
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Yeah. You can count on it.

35
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,600
I think so. Yes. They get along so well.

36
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
I like him. He's good for Susan.

37
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,600
He's a little quiet.

38
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,600
It's hard to do anything but listen in this family.

39
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,600
How can anybody get a word in around here?

40
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
You're right, Ellen.

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Oh, really?

42
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
It's the way it should be.

43
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
The Stewarts are the Stewarts!

44
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
They always were,

45
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
and they always will be.

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Right!

47
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
They've always got an opinion.

48
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Always got something to say.

49
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
And now there's Max Stewart.

50
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
and if he talks as loudly as he cries,

51
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
we're all in for trouble.

52
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
He's quiet now.

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Mmm-hmm. That's because he's sleeping.

54
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:10,600
He's really cute.

55
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,600
It's not necessary to whisper, Harry.

56
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
A baby gets used to voices.

57
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
I remember now.

58
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
We always whispered when Michelle was born.

59
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,600
And I didn't sleep well, Daddy told me.

60
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
I never slept.

61
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
And when I did,

62
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
I woke up when I heard someone speak.

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
I bet you were cute.

64
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
She sure was.

65
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Not as cute as Max.

66
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,600
He's like a little doll.

67
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Oh, good.

68
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Now I can help diaper him.

69
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Let's get Marilyn.

70
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,600
What do you do when he cries like that?

71
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
You pick him up.

72
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,600
He's so little... so new.

73
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Let's call Marilyn.

74
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Time for a feeding and time for a diapering.

75
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
You're a real Stewart.
