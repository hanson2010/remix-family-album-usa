00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Hello. What can I do for you?

2
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Hi. Fill 'er up.

3
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
I need a full tank.

4
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,600
Check the hood?

5
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
No, thanks.

6
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Whereabouts are you headed?

7
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,600
Pete Waters's farm, near Chesterton.

8
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
I know it well.

9
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Pete Waters's lived around here almost as long as I have.

10
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,600
How long is it going to take for me to get there?

11
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
About fifteen minutes.

12
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
There's a shortcut - if you know it.

13
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
No, I don't.

14
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Could you tell me how to use the shortcut?

15
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Sure. You take the next left turn.

16
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
You'll see a stop sign.

17
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Make a right at the stop sign.

18
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Stay on that road, and you'll cross a blue bridge.

19
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Then you'll see a big old red barn.

20
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
That's the back of Pete Waters's place.

21
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,600
That's quite a difference from the directions that Pete sent me.

22
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Now, if you take that route, it's probably a lot simpler,

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
but it'll take you ten minutes longer.

24
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,600
OK. Let me repeat it.

25
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,600
I take the next left turn to the stop sign.

26
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Then a right across a blue bridge,

27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
and then a big red barn.

28
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Can't miss it.

29
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,600
How much do I owe you?

30
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Well, that'll be eighteen dollars and seventy cents.

31
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
No charge for the cleanup.

32
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
It's on the house.

33
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Well, here's a twenty.

34
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Ah. OK. That's a dollar and thirty cents change.

35
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,600
There we go... will make twenty. Thanks.

36
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Thank you.

37
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
And thanks for the directions.

38
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
This must be Pete's barn.

39
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Turn right to the house.

40
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Hi.

41
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Hi. What can I do for you?

42
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Is this the Pete Waters farm?

43
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
It is.

44
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
I'm a friend of Pete's.

45
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
I'm looking for the house.

46
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
It's just over yonder.

47
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Keep along this road

48
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
till you get to the end of the fence.

49
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
You'll see the chicken house.

50
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
His house is on the left.

51
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Well, thanks.

52
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
"Have gone to the railroad station.

53
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Back soon with a surprise.

54
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Make yourself at home.

55
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Have a look around. Pete."

56
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Same old Pete Waters.

57
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Always full of surprises.
