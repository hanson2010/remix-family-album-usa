1
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Hot dogs. I love hot dogs.

2
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,600
There is nothing better than a hot dog in the country.

3
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Hot dogs and mustard.

4
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Cooked outdoors over an open fire.

5
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
I wish I had one now.

6
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Do you remember when Daddy and I used to take you

7
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,600
and Susan and Robbie to Jones Beach?

8
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Oh, I sure do.

9
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
We'd wait until dark and make a fire,

10
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
and we'd cook the hot dogs.

11
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Oh, don't forget the mustard.

12
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
And, oh, does anybody want ketchup?

13
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I might as well take it along.

14
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,600
And now to make sure we've got the hamburger patties.

15
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:45,600
I have to remember to put them in the bag

16
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
tomorrow morning before we leave.

17
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
I'll remind you, Richard.

18
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Mom,

19
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
we really appreciate your taking care of Max for the weekend

20
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
and giving up your free time.

21
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
I love doing it.

22
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Susan and Harry have a sitter for Michelle in the city,

23
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,600
and I'm taking care of Max.

24
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
It's no big deal.

25
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
I am happy to do it for you.

26
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
I guess Max is asleep by now.

27
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
He's not crying anymore.

28
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Oh, poor baby. He's teething.

29
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Well, he's asleep, finally.

30
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
I feel so bad for him.

31
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,600
It hurts so much when a baby gets his first teeth.

32
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,600
He'll be fine, Marilyn.

33
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Well, he wakes up several times during the night,

34
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
and the pain is so bad.

35
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
I'm really concerned about going away for the weekend, Ellen,

36
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,600
and leaving you with the full responsibility of taking care of Max.

37
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Especially with his teething.

38
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
I wish he felt better.

39
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Please don't worry, Marilyn.

40
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Remember your father-in-law's a pediatrician.

41
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
We have a live-in doctor if there's a problem I can't handle.

42
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
I agree, Marilyn.

43
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
We really don't have to be overly concerned.

44
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,600
I'll go upstairs and stay with him until he falls asleep again.

45
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Thanks, Richard.

46
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Try putting him across your lap on his stomach.

47
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
He likes that.

48
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
I'll try it.

49
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
When are Susan and Harry picking you up, Marilyn?

50
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
They're coming by at six tomorrow morning,

51
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
so we can get an early start.

52
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
That's nice.

53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
And you'll have a full day in the country.

54
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
And a full night.

55
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Tomorrow night we'll be camping out in tents.

56
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
And coming home on Sunday?

57
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
We'll be heading back late in the afternoon.

58
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,600
You're going to have the time of your lives.

59
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Camping out is such great fun.

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
We'll have a great time camping out, I'm sure.

61
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
But I'm still a little worried about you, Ellen.

62
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
It will be my great pleasure, Marilyn.

63
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Remember, it's only one night.

64
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
He's asleep.

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
I think he'll sleep through the night now.

66
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Thanks, honey.

67
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,600
I hope he's good when we're away.

68
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Well, so do I.

69
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Now, to check the list of things we need for the camping trip.

70
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,600
We need to bring a flashlight.

71
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,600
It's in the right-hand drawer, next to the bottle openers.

72
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Do we have a bottle opener on the list, Marilyn?

73
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,600
No. No bottle opener.

74
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Is that one of the things Susan and Harry are bringing?

75
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
No.

76
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
And we're bringing the ketchup, mustard, relish, all that stuff.

77
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
And cooking utensils.

78
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Well, here's the bottle opener, and here's the flashlight.

79
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Matches.

80
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Matches.

81
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Yes, of course.

82
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
For when we build our campfire.

83
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
I can't build a fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together.

84
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
And don't forget your camera and film, Richard.

85
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
All packed and ready.

86
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
And let's not forget our cassette player and some tapes.

87
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Some music tapes and some blank tapes

88
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,600
so that we can record our thoughts about the trip.

89
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Oh, that's a nice idea.

90
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
An audio diary.

91
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
That's what I thought.

92
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Got it!

93
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
The cassette player and the tapes.
