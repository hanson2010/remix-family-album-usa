1
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,600
Sam, would you come in, please?

2
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,600
You sound like something's bothering you, Susan.

3
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,600
The sketches for the cover of the new doll book?

4
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,600
That's not it.

5
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Please sit down.

6
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Sure.

7
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:16,600
I need your advice on a personsal matter,

8
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,600
but it's not about me.

9
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,600
You need my advice on a personal matter,

10
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,600
and it's not about you.

11
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,600
It's about my grandfather.

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
What's the problem?

13
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,600
It won't sound like a big deal,

14
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
but it is.

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
I had dinner with him Saturday,

16
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
and he's very unhappy about not working.

17
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,600
I thought he was retired

18
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
and pleased to be living with the family.

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
He is,

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
but there's so much energy and talent in the man,

21
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
and he doesn't get to use it.

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
But what can I do?

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
What kind of advice are you looking for?

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Simply this.

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,600
John Marchetta runs this company.

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
He founded this company.

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Right.

28
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,600
John Marchetta gave me my start here six years ago,

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,600
When I first graduated from college.

30
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
He gave me the chance to use my talents

31
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
and made me feel more confident.

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Right.

33
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Maybe he can do the same thing for your grandfather.

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Or at least give him some advice.

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Right.

36
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Then I've solved your problem.

37
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,600
I can always depend on you, Sam.

38
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
I'm glad to help.

39
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Shall I call Mr. Marchetta for you?

40
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,600
No, no. I'll do that.

41
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Thanks.

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Now, how's the Stewart family?

43
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Fine, thank you, Mr. Mrarchetta.

44
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Except for my grandfather.

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
What's wrong, Susan?

46
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
What's wrong with him?

47
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
He needs to work.

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,600
In fact, that is the reason why I'm here to see you.

49
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,600
I know you're building a new factory,

50
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,600
and I thought ... maybe ...

51
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,600
my grandfather is

52
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
so experienced in the construction trade,

53
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,600
he could be so valuable.

54
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Tell him to come and see me

55
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

56
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
I have an idea that may solve the problem for him

57
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
and help a lot of other people.

58
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Really, Mr. Marchetta?

59
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Can I tell him that?

60
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Sure can.

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Ten o'clock in the morning. Here.

62
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Oh, thank you!
