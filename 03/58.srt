1
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Where's Mom?

2
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
She went to a school-board meeting.

3
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,600
I don't know how she does it.

4
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
She sure keeps busy.

5
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
It's important to her.

6
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,600
There are lots of places to go,

7
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
lots of things to do.

8
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,600
She can't sit around and do nothing.

9
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Philip works late.

10
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
I guess you're right.

11
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,600
I wish I had her energy.

12
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Anybody home?

13
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
We're in here, Dad.

14
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Oh. Hi, gang.

15
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Hello, Philip.

16
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
How was your day?

17
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
My day was just fine.

18
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
So was my night.

19
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
It's almost ten o'clock.

20
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Mmm. I'm starving.

21
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Um... where's Mom?

22
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
She went to a school-board meeting.

23
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,600
There's a note for you on the refrigerator.

24
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Oh?

25
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Did you have dinner, Robbie?

26
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Yeah.

27
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Mike and I had a hamburger at the diner.

28
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
I came home a little while ago.

29
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
You've been working late

30
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
almost every night this week, Dad.

31
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Aren't you exhausted?

32
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,600
I don't have time to be exhausted.

33
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,600
You and Mom haven't had dinner together with us

34
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
in almost a full week.

35
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Yeah,

36
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
I feel bad

37
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
about us not having dinner with the family,

38
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
but our schedules are so different.

39
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Either I'm at the hospital doing paperwork,

40
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
or Mom is at a committee meeting.

41
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
I frankly don't know what to do about it.

42
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,600
I'm worried about you and Mom.

43
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
You really have been working too hard.

44
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Well,

45
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
I think I've had enough of that sandwich.

46
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
You didn't finish it.

47
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,600
It's not good to eat before going to bed.

48
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
A cookie can't hurt, though.

49
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Well,

50
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
I'm heading off for bed

51
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
and a good night's sleep.

52
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Well, good night.

53
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Good night, Son.

54
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Good night, Dad.

55
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
I'm going to bed.

56
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Good night, Philip.

57
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Haven't you finished balancing that checkbook?

58
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,600
I found another mistake.

59
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I'll be off to bed myself in a minute.

60
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
OK. Good night.

61
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:53,600
I'm really concerned about them,

62
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Grandpa.

63
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Concerned about whom?

64
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
About Mom and Dad.

65
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
They hardly ever see each other.

66
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Dad often works late,

67
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
and Mom has all these committees she's on.

68
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,600
What do you propose to do about it?

69
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
You have that look in your eye.

70
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
I don't know,

71
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
but there must be a way

72
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
of getting them to spend more time together.

73
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Quality time.
