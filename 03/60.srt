1
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Good morning.

2
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
What a wonderful morning!

3
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
Don't the flowers smell wonderful?

4
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Good morning, Ellen.

5
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Yes, they do.

6
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,600
That's why I'm reading my paper and having my coffee

7
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
on the patio this morning.

8
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Ah, it does smell sweet.

9
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,600
How was your school-board meeting last night?

10
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,600
You must've come home very late.

11
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Did you find the sandwich I made for you?

12
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Thanks, dear.

13
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,600
I was so tired

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
I didn't even finish it.

15
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,600
Philip, I've been working on this special project

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
with the school board,

17
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,600
and I'd like your opinion about it.

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,600
What is it?

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,600
I've been trying to find

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
a way to encourage reading.

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Good luck!

22
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Well, I think I may have found a way to do it.

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Tell me about it.

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,600
I work with families every day, Ellen.

25
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
I see how people spend their leisure time,

26
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
young and old.

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Mostly watching television.

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Well, that would be OK

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
if, and I repeat,

30
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
if people took the time to read.

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
I couldn't agree with you more.

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
The question is,

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
how do we get them to read more?

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
I think

35
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,600
you're going to give me the answer to that question.

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
You have that look in your eye.

37
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
I do have an answer, Philip.

38
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Or at least I think I do.

39
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Well, tell me about it.

40
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
The plan is a simple one.

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Involve the entire family in a reading project.

42
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
In the home?

43
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Yes, in the home.

44
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
But first in the school-rooms.

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Hmm, interesting.

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,600
But how do you plan to do that?

47
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,600
By arranging with the public schools

48
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
to schedule one hour a week to start with.

49
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
During that time

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
parents are invited to attend--

51
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,600
and to read along with the children - their children.

52
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,600
It can go beyond the school system, Ellen.

53
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Really?

54
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,600
I guarantee you it would go very well in the hospitals.

55
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
My patients, mostly kids,

56
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
would love to read and be read to.

57
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
You think so?

58
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
I know so.

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Maybe we can experiment with your patients

60
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
and see how the plan works.

61
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
I love the idea.

62
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Would you work with me on it?

63
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
I would love to, Philip.

64
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,600
And that way,

65
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
we'll spend more time together, Ellen.

66
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,600
We just don't see each other anymore.

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
You and I are very busy these days.

68
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
This is true.

69
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
We need to find time to be together more,

70
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
to do things together more, you and I.

71
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
This would be a wonderful way to accomplish that.

72
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
I have a question.

73
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Yes?

74
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,600
What do we read?

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
To the patients in the ward?

76
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Yes.

77
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Well,

78
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
let you and I talk about it.

79
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
What would you like to read to them?

80
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Mrs. Stewart and I Stewart

81
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
will read a poem by Robert Frost.

82
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
It's called

83
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening".

84
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Would you begin, Ellen?

85
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
All right.

86
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,600
"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"

87
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,600
by Robert Frost.

88
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Whose woods these are I think I know.

89
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
His house is in the village though;

90
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,600
He will not see me stopping here

91
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
To watch his woods fill up with snow.

92
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
My little horse must think it queer

93
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
To stop without a farmhouse near

94
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Between the woods and frozen lake

95
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
The darkest evening of the year.

96
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
He gives his harness bells a shake

97
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
To ask if there is some mistake.

98
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
The only other sound's the sweep

99
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Of easy wind and downy flake.

100
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,600
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,

101
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
But I have promises to keep,

102
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,600
And miles to go before I sleep,

103
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,600
And miles to go before I sleep.

104
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:48,600
You two belong on stage! That was wonderful!

105
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Grandpa!

106
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Dad... Robbie. When did you come?

107
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
We've been listening to you both.

108
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
These are lucky kids.

109
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Do you enjoy reading together?

110
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Well, we may read together aloud at home.

111
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
You were right, Robbie.

112
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
I know.
