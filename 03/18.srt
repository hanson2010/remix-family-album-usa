1
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:46,600
OK, everybody.

2
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,600
I want to welcome Harry and his daughter Michelle

3
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,600
to Thanksgiving with us.

4
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
Thank you, Dr. Stewart.

5
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
Call me Philip.

6
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
OK.

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
But first, I think we should take a moment

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
and remember the meaning of Thanksgiving.

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,600
Philip, I took Michelle to a school play Philip

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,600
about the first Thanksgiving.

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Well, why don't you tell us about that, Michelle?

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Thanksgiving was about the Pilgrims,

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,600
the first settlers in America.

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
They shared the first harvest with the Indians

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
and gave thanks.

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,600
All right.

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,600
Then in that spirit let each of us give thanks.

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,600
Each in his own way.

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,600
Who wants to begin?

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
I will.

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,600
I give thanks for being here with my family and for being well,

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
so I can enjoy you all.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
All rihgt!

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
We love you, Grandpa.

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,600
I'd like to give thanks for a healthy year, a good job,

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,600
and for meeting Harry and Michelle.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
We'd like to give thanks for meeting Susan

28
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
and the Stewart family.

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
I love you, Daddy.

30
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Thanks, Harry.

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
That was very kind of you.

32
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
I'd like to give thanks for Grandpa coming to live with us.

33
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
And I'd also like to thank my math teacher

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
for giving me a passing grade.

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,600
And call me, Alexandra.

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Oh, Robbie!

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
She'll call.

38
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
You go first, Marilyn.

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
I'm thinking.

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
You go first.

41
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Well, you all know I'm working on my photo album.

42
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
It's not finished yet.

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,600
And I'd like to thank Marilyn for being so patient.

44
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Thanks, Richard.

45
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
I should thank you for encouraging me

46
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
to keep working on my fashion designs.

47
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,600
I'm lucky to have a husband with an artistic eye.

48
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Oh, we have a lot to be thankful for.

49
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
For the food on this table.

50
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Just like the Pilgrims.

51
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,600
I'll go along with that, Ellen.

52
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Well, help me serve, Robbie.

53
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,600
It was a wonderful meal, Mrs. Stewart.

54
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Thank you.

55
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
And now to see the end of the football game.

56
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Exactly.

57
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Where are you going, Philip?

58
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Remember, the Michigan football game?

59
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
And Michigan needs a touchdown. Michigan

60
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Did you forget something?

61
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Dad, your famous apple pie.

62
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Just let me see the score, Ellen.

63
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Go ahead, Philip.

64
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
We should all take a little break before dessert.

65
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Oh, who could that be?

66
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Oh, it must be Alexandra.

67
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
I invited her to come by for dessert.

68
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
You did?

69
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
I like Ellen.

70
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
You know everyone, Alexandra.

71
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
No, she doesn't know Harry Bennett and his daughter Michelle.

72
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Nice to meet you.

73
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Hi.

74
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Hi.

75
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Hello, Alexandra.

76
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Hi, Marilyn.

77
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,000
Hi, Susan.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,600
Happy Thanksgiving.

79
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,600
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie. Alexandra

80
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Please sit down, Alexandra.

81
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Dad, Richard--Alexandra's here.

82
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Michigan needs a touchdown. Michigan

83
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Three minutes to play.

84
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Hi, Alexandra. Welcome.

85
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Hello, Alexandra.

86
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Yes, Michigan needs a touchdown.

87
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,600
One tiny little touchdown, with just three minutes to play.

88
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
You want Michigan to win.

89
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
How'd you guess?

90
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie. Alexandra

91
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:26,600
What happened?

92
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,600
We forgot to turn the oven on.

93
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
We did?

94
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Philip, why don't you go Philip

95
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
watch the last three minutes of the game.

96
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
I will serve coffee and pumpkin pie.

97
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
OK. I'll be back in a few minutes.

98
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Robbie, would you bring the dessert plates. Robbie

99
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
And, Marilyn, would you pour coffee, please. Marilyn

100
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Sure, Ellen.

101
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,600
How was your Thanksgiving dinner, Alexandra?

102
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Just wonderful, Mr. Stewart.

103
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,600
The Molinas are a large family. Molina

104
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,601
I love being with them.

105
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,602
I'm glad you came by, Alexandra.

106
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,603
I am, too.

107
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:12,604
Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!

108
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,605
Great Thanksgiving.

109
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,606
Lots to be thankful for.

110
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,607
Michigan scored a touchdown. Michigan

111
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,608
Alexandra came by. Alexandra

112
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,609
And nobody misses Philip's famous apple pie.

113
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,610
Oh, Grandpa!
