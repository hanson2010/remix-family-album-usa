1
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,600
I love my school. I have so many good friends there now.

2
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,600
I wouldn't miss a day even if I were really sick.

3
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,600
Come and sit down for a minute, Michelle.

4
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,600
I'd like to talk to you about something.

5
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Something important.

6
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
What's wrong, Susan?

7
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Oh, there's nothing wrong, Michelle.

8
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,600
But your daddy and I are talking about something

9
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,600
that I'd like your opinion about.

10
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,600
I know. I heard you talking about it

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
the other night when I was trying on my new clothes.

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,600
It's about moving to Los Angeles.

13
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,600
You're right. How do you feel about it?

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Well, I really wouldn't want to move, but...

15
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,600
But?

16
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,600
But if you and Daddy wanted to,

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,600
I guess you know what's best for the family and for me.

18
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,600
That's very considerate of you, Michelle.

19
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
But what about your friends?

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
I'd miss them a lot,

21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,600
but I know what it feels like to miss someone.

22
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Honey, we don't have to move

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
if you're not going to be happy about it.

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Does Daddy want to move?

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,600
I think so. He's going to tell us tonight about the job offer.

26
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Well, how was everybody's day today?

27
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Michelle was chosen to do Michelle

28
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
the school poster for the play this year.

29
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Congratulations, Michelle! That's something!

30
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,600
And how was your day, Susan?

31
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
I see you're in a good mood.

32
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Why don't you tell us about your day.

33
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
I met with Bill York.

34
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
It's OK to talk about it, Harry.

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Michelle knows all about it. Michelle

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Really?

37
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Really, Harry.

38
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Michelle and I have all kinds of feelings

39
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
about leaving New York, the family, and friends.

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,600
But if you think you should take the job, we're behind you.

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
What about Michelle's school?

42
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
We'll move after the school term.

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
What about her new friends?

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,600
I'll make new friends wherever we are as long as we're together.

45
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,600
We're a family, Harry.

46
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Whatever you think is right for you is right for us.

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I am so touched. The two of you are really something.

48
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
We love you, Daddy.

49
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
And I love you.

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,600
OK. Now, tell us about your talk with Mr. York.

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Did you take the job?

52
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Nope.

53
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
What?

54
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
No? You didn't take it?

55
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
No, I did not take the job.

56
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
But, Daddy, I thought ...

57
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Harry, you didn't turn it down because of me... Harry

58
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Or me?

59
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
No, no. I turned it down because of me.

60
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
How's that?

61
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Well, I began to think about you and about Michelle,

62
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
and then I asked myself,

63
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
do I really want to work for the biggest company in the country?

64
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
And?

65
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
And I don't.

66
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
I went into business for myself

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
because I like being my own boss.

68
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,600
I run my own company. I'm a big fish in a little pond.

69
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,600
I'm not really sure I want to be a little fish in a big pond.

70
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Oh, Daddy, does that mean we don't have to move?

71
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
That's right, sweetheart.

72
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Are you sure?

73
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
I couldn't be more sure, Susan.

74
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,600
I'm glad if you are, Harry.

75
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
And besides,

76
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
how could I live in Los Angeles

77
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
when all my favorite people live here?

78
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Your favorite people?

79
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Who's that?

80
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,600
The Stewart family, of course.
