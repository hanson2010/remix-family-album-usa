1
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, it's a quarter to four,

2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,600
and I have a production meeting at four.

3
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
I planned to take you for a ride in Central Park

4
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
in a horse and carriage.

5
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Harry, I'd love to,

6
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
but I have work to do.

7
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,600
OK. We'll walk back to your office with you.

8
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,600
It's so nice out.

9
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,600
I decided to forget about my accounting problems

10
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,600
and just enjoy this beautiful spring day.

11
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Take the time, Susan.

12
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
I know I should,

13
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,600
but ... well, there are too many things to do.

14
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
I understand.

15
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
I'll go for a ride with Michelle.

16
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Right.

17
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Well, I had a really nice time.

18
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
So did I.

19
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
So did I.

20
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
I'm sorry you can't come with us, Susan.

21
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
So am I.

22
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Bye-bye.

23
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Harry! Michelle!

24
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Can you wait till I make a phone call?

25
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Sure.

26
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Susan Stewart's office.

27
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Sam, this is Susan. Sam

28
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Hi. How was lunch?

29
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Fine.

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
You're late.

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,600
The production department's waiting in the conference room.

32
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
I know.

33
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Ask Paul Smith to fill in for me.

34
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
He knows everything about the production schedule,

35
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
and he can answer any questions.

36
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Right.

37
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Don't tell any one,

38
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
but I'm taking a little time to smell the flowers.

39
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Good for you.

40
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
It'll be our secret.

41
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
But schedule another production meeting for tomorrow.

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
I'll be back

43
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
for my six o'clock appointment with Mr. Ozawa.

44
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
OK, Susan.

45
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
And have a nice afternoon.

46
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Thanks.

47
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
She likes you.

48
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
I know. I like her.

49
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
How'd you do it?

50
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
We had a talk.

51
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
About what?

52
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Life.

53
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
And what did you decide?

54
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
That's a secret... between us women.
