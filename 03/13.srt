00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Hi, Grandpa.

2
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Hi, Robbie.

3
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Can I help?

4
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Yes, indeed.

5
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Hand me two eggs from the refrigerator,

6
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
and I'll make you two fried eggs.

7
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,600
How about some bacon?

8
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
I made enough for an army.

9
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
You going to the baseball game today?

10
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,600
It's a perfect day for it--a little cloudy but nice and warm.

11
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Dad and I were planning to go to the game,

12
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
but he has to work today,

13
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
and my friends don't want to go.

14
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
It's not an important game, anyway.

15
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Do you have any other plans for the day?

16
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
I'll work on my computer.

17
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,600
I have a new math program, and I want to learn how to use it.

18
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Maybe you can teach me

19
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
how to work on a computer someday.

20
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Anytime. It's really easy, but, like anything,

21
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
you need to work at it, Grandpa.

22
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,600
This bacon is great.

23
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I love crispy bacon.

24
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Oh, what are you doing tomorrow?

25
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Nothing much.

26
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Well, maybe your dad and I could take you fishing with us.

27
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
I'd like that, but ...

28
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
But what?

29
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
But Dad is always so busy.

30
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Well, can you come fishing with me tomorrow?

31
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Sure, I can.

32
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Robbie says you can't take him to the game today. Robbie

33
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I really feel bad about it,

34
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
but they need me at the hospital today,

35
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
in the children's ward.

36
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
I understand.

37
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Maybe we can spend some time together next weekend.

38
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Definitely.

39
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
We should.

40
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
You and Robbie and me.

41
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Remember our first fishing trip?

42
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I sure do....

43
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Well, I've got to run, Dad.

44
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
See you later.

45
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Going fishing?

46
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
I'm thinking about it....

47
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
So, how's work?

48
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Oh, the usual problems.

49
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
You're working pretty hard these days.

50
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
I guess I am.

51
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,600
When did you last go fishing with Robbie?

52
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
I remember exactly.

53
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
It was on his birthday, June second, two years ago.

54
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,600
We didn't catch anything.

55
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Remember our fishing trips?

56
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Yes. I loved them.

57
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Remember catching your first fish?

58
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
How can I forget?

59
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
I fell out of the boat!

60
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,600
We had some good times together.

61
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Yes, we did.

62
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Maybe we should do it again.

63
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,600
How about tomorrow?

64
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Don't you have to work?

65
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
My paper work will wait.

66
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Oh, Robbie will be thrilled.

67
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
I am, too, Son.

68
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
I want to spend more time with Robbie.

69
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Tomorrow.

70
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
It'll be like old times for you and me.

71
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
And Robbie will love it. Robbie

72
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Well, what's the weather going to be like?

73
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Radio says sunny and mild.

74
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Well, I'll tell Robbie.

75
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,600
And thanks, Dad.

76
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Don't thank me.

77
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm just being a grandfather.
