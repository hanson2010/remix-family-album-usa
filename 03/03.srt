1
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And give her a teaspoon of the medicine after every meal.

2
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

3
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're welcome. Good-bye.

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:12,000
How are you?

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm tired and hungry.

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, Marilyn and Richard called.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
They'll be here soon, and then we'll eat.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
All right. Is...is Susan coming?

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, she'll be here later.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
She has to work late tonight.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And what's Robbie cooking for dinner? Robbie

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's a surprise.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I hope it's pasta.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Robbie, the dinner was terrific. Robbie

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes, it was delicious.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What's for dessert?

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh, I forgot dessert.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Robbie! Robbie

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Don't worry.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We've got lots of ice cream.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh, I'd love some ice cream.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Well, there's chocolate and coffee and a little vanilla.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll have vanilla.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Is that all right with everyone?

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll have chocolate.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Me, too.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Uh, one scoop of coffee

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and one scoop of chocolate for me.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Robbie, will you help me serve? Robbie

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I keep thinking about that bag of film. Eight rolls.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
A whole day's work.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And good stuff, too.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Don't worry, Richard.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Somenoe will find it.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll get it. Hello.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hello.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Does Richard Stewart live here? Richard Stewart

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes, he's my brother.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm Robbie...Robbie Stewart.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm Alexandra Pappas.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How do you do?

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Your brother left his bag of film on the ferryboat.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I found it.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm really glad to see you.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I mean...my brother'll be really glad to see you!

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Robbie! Who is it? Robbie

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's Richard's film! Richard

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I mean, Alexandra Pappas.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Come in, please.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Alexandra! Alexandra

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hello, Richard. I found your bag!

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Um...Alexandra, let me introduce you.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This is my wife Marilyn.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Richard showed me your photo. Richard

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
How do you do?

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh yes.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Richard told us all about you. Richard

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's nice to meet you.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And this is my mother, Ellen Stewart.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
How do you do?

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And my father, Dr. Philip Stewart.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Nice to meet you, Alexandra.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And...ah...you met Robbie.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes. And you must be Susan. Hi.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Hi. Welcome.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm so glad you found the bag

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and took the time and trouble to return it.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh, it was no trouble.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I just took the wrong train.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Would you like something to eat?

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Thank you, no.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm late for dinner at my house.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I really have to go.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Would you like to call home?

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'd appreciate that.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Please, use the phone.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Thanks. Excuse me.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Alexandra's a high-school exchange student from Greece. Alexandra

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Where does she live?

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
With a family in the Bronx.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh, that's not too far from here!

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Take it easy, Robbie.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Thank you.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I can only stay a few minutes.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Have some iced tea.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Thanks, Mrs. Stewart.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Please sit down, Alexandra.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So, you're an exchange student.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Where do you go to school?

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
At the Bronx High School of Science.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, that's a very good school.

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What are your favorite subjects?

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Biology and mathematics.

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Richard tells me you're a doctor. Richard

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes, a pediatrician.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And what does your father do?

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He's a lawyer, in Thessaloniki.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Would you like some pasta?

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I made it myself.

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It might be a little cold.

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Thanks, no. I do have to go.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It was nice meeting you all.

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Well, maybe you'll come for lunch some Sunday,

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
so we can really thank you

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
for bringing Richard's bag back.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Maybe.

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're welcome anytime.

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Good-bye.

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Can I drive you home?

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
No, thanks.

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The train is just up the street.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It won't take me long at all.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Well, you really saved the day for me, Alexandra.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Bye.

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Bye-bye.

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Good night.

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:58,000
She's a smart young lady, and very nice.

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Very! Hey, she forgot her bag!

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I guess we'll be seeing Alexandra again.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Right, Robbie?
