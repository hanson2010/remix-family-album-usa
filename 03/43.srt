1
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
What's this for?

2
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Just because. How's the baby?

3
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Fast asleep.

4
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,600
I'm sorry I missed him.

5
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
I had to work late.

6
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,600
What are the flowers for, Richard?

7
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Five years of happiness. Happy anniversary.

8
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
But our anniversary isn't until Saturday.

9
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
I couldn't wait.

10
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Besides, we are not going to be here Saturday.

11
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
We're not?

12
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Uh-uh.

13
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Where are we going to be?

14
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,600
If you had your choice of all the places in the world.

15
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
where would you choose to spend our anniversary?

16
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,600
The Watermill Inn.

17
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
I loved that place when we went on our honeymoon.

18
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Perfect! You picked the right place.

19
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
I don't understand.

20
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
You and I, Mrs. Stewart, Stewart

21
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
are going to spend a second honeymoon at the Watermill Inn.

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Oh, Richard! That's wonderful, but--

23
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
No buts.

24
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
What about the baby?

25
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Aren't we taking the baby on our honeymoon?

26
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Absolutely not.

27
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
The world's greatest grandmother, Mrs. Ellen Stewart,

28
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
has agreed to take care of him for the weekend.

29
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Richard, isn't that too much to ask of your mother?

30
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Too much? She loves taking care of Max.

31
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,600
But... I'll miss him.

32
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Well, we'll phone every hour,

33
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
and you can listen to him over the phone.

34
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Come on, Mar.

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,600
It's time you and I had a romantic weekend alone together.

36
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,600
We've earned it. What do you say?

37
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,600
It does sound tempting.

38
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,600
You're right. We've earned it.

39
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Great! I'll make a reservation right now.

40
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Remember that wonderful little balcony

41
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
where we had our meals ...

42
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
with a view of the Hudson River?

43
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
How could I forget?

44
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Hello. Is Mrs. Montefiore there?

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Ah. She's out.

46
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Yes. This is Richard Stewart.

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
My wife and I spent our honeymoon at the inn.

48
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,600
No, we didn't leave anything in the room.

49
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
It's five years ago.

50
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
We'd like to make a reservation for this weekend.

51
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Yes, a double room, please.

52
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
What?

53
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Are you sure? But... OK.

54
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Nothing available.

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Wait! Don't hang up!

56
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Can you recommend someplace nice - someplace nearby?

57
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Uh, hold it. Old Country Inn?

58
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Right. And the phone number?

59
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:59,600
555-2420. Thank you. 555 2420

60
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,600
He says there's another inn

61
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
just half a mile down the road from the Watermill.

62
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,600
It won't be the same, but what do you say?

63
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Well...

64
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
My mom is available to baby-sit this weekend.

65
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Well, OK. See if they have a room.

66
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Right!

67
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Hello. Is this the Old Country Inn?

68
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Yes. This is Richard Stewart.

69
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,600
The desk clerk at the Watemill suggested your inn.

70
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Would you happen to have a room for two availbale

71
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
this weekend?

72
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Something really nice.

73
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
My wife and I are celebrating our fifth anniversary.

74
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Yes. I'll hold. He's checking. You do?

75
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Great! What is the daily rate?

76
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,600
That's fine. Thank you.

77
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Yes, we'll be arriving by car about ten o'clock Friday night.

78
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Stewart. S-t-e-w-a-r-t. Thank you.

79
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Done! You and I, Mrs. Stewart.

80
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
are going to have a wonderful, romantic weekend!

81
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Richard, that's the baby.
