1
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,600
"Rock-a-bye, baby, on the tree top,

2
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,600
When the wind blows,

3
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,600
The cradle will rock.

4
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
When the bough breaks,

5
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,600
The cradle will fall,

6
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,600
And down will come baby,

7
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Cradle and all."

8
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Hi, Marilyn,

9
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
What are you doing?

10
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Just sketching.

11
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I've been thinking a lot about our responsibilities

12
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
in the past few weeks.

13
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
I never stop thinking about them.

14
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
I've been wrestling

15
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,600
with the question of whether I go back to work or not.

16
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I see.

17
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
And I'm torn.

18
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
I really want to go back to work,

19
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
use my talents,

20
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
and pursue my career in fashion design

21
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
like we always thought I would.

22
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
But now...

23
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
I want to be with Max as a full-time mother,

24
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
especially when he's a baby.

25
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
I really understand, Marilyn.

26
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
But you never have to worry about Max.

27
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
There's Mother and Grandpa...

28
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
and I can always arrange my photo schedule

29
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
around your schedule,

30
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
if that will help.

31
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,600
It's not the same, Richard.

32
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Have you discussed going back to work with your boss?

33
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Rita Mae called yesterday. Rita Mae

34
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Ah! That's what's got you thinking, isn't it?

35
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
She wants to know

36
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
when I think I'll be returning to the boutique.

37
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
And you said...?

38
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
I said I'd give her an answer in a few days ...

39
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,600
that I wasn't sure.

40
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I'm sure Rita Mae will understand

41
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
and wait until you're ready to go back to work.

42
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, maybe she will, and maybe she won't.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Who knows?

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,600
If I don't accept her offer,

45
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
maybe she'll find someone else in the meantime,

46
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
and when I'm ready to go back,

47
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
there won't be a job for me.

48
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
That's something to consider.

49
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
You've got yourself to think about, too.

50
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
But I am thinking about myself.

51
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Don't you see?

52
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
What do you mean?

53
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
It's not just the job.

54
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:34,600
It's also my career as Max's mother.

55
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
That's the way I look at it.

56
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I have two career opportunities at the same time.

57
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
My career as a fashion designer

58
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
and my career as a mother.

59
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,600
I never really thought about being a mother as a career.

60
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,600
I guess you do have two career opportunities

61
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,600
and a decision to make.

62
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,600
I hear Max.

63
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
I'll do it.
