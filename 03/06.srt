1
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,600
What happened?

2
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,600
The baby-sitter called.

3
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
His daughter is sick.

4
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,600
What's wrong?

5
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,600
I think she has a stomachache.

6
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,600
He's a good father.

7
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,600
So... what do you think of him?

8
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,600
He's very nice.

9
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,600
But I think he was nervous tonight.

10
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,600
It was his first date in two years.

11
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Will you see him again?

12
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,600
I hope so.

13
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,600
This food is delicious.

14
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,600
He didn't get a thing to eat.

15
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
You ordered enough for three or four people,

16
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,600
but I'm not complaining.

17
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
The food is delicious.

18
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Who is that?

19
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Do you think it's...

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:13,600
No. You won't believe it, Marilyn!

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
I believe it. Even without looking.

22
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Hi!

23
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
How...?

24
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Your downstairs neighbor let me in.

25
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Did you go home?

26
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
I did , but everything is OK,

27
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
so I decided to come back.

28
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
To apologize for leaving so early,

29
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I brought you a little gift.

30
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,600
It's a bonsai tree

31
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Hi, Marilyn. I hope it's not too late.

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Oh, not at all. We're still eating.

33
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Please, come in. Join us.

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
It's our meal from the restaurant.

35
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,600
And how is your daughter?

36
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Oh, she's fine.

37
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,600
It's good that you went back.

38
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Yes, I think it's important for me to be there

39
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
since her mother died.

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,600
I agree. Aren't you hungry?

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,600
As a matter of fact... I am hungry.

42
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
There's lots of food left.

43
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Mmm, this is delicious!

44
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Enjoy!

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
I'm going to excuse myself.

46
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
I have a lot of work to do to get ready for tomorrow.

47
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Good night, Harry. It was nice meeting you.

48
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Bye, Marilyn.

49
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Good night, Susan.

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Good night, Marilyn.

51
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,600
She's going to a fashion show here in the city tomorrow.

52
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
She is sleeping here

53
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,600
so she won't have to travel from Riverdale in the morning.

54
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
You two must be close.

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,600
we are.

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
The whole Stewart family is close.

57
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I like that.

58
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:57,600
And then, two years ago, my wife died.

59
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
You miss her.

60
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,600
I do... yes, but I have Michelle...

61
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
and with time...

62
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Is there anyone else in your life?

63
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,600
No, not yet. What about you?

64
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Oh, I date occasionally,

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
but my work keeps me busy.

66
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Ooh, speaking of keeping busy,

67
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
I have an early start tomorrow,

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
and the baby-sitter has to get home.

69
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Where did the time go?

70
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
It's midnight.

71
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Thank you, Susan.

72
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
I had a nice evening.

73
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Me, too, Harry. Harry?

74
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Yes?

75
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
I'd like to meet your daughter someday.

76
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Does that mean that I can see you again?

77
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Of course.

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Wonderful. I'll call you,

79
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
and we'll go out to dinner.

80
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Please do.

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
I promise I won't leave early.

82
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,600
It was for a good reason.

83
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
You know something?

84
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
What?

85
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
I think we're going to be good friends.

86
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Good night, Susan.

87
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Good night, Harry.

88
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Have a safe trip home.

89
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Are you all right?

90
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Sorry.

91
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,600
I never liked that umbrella stand.

92
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Good night, Harry.
