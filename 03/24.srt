1
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,600
It hurts, doesn't it?

2
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,600
You'll feel better tomorrow, Betty, believe me.

3
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Only one day, and it won't hurt as much.

4
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Do you feel like eating?

5
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Having some dinner?

6
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,600
Oh, don't look so sad.

7
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Let me tell you about your dinner.

8
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,600
It's ice cream.

9
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Ice cream.

10
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
All kinds of flavors.

11
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Chocolate.

12
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Strawberry?

13
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Vanilla?

14
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Vanilla, too?

15
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,600
I see you're feeling better already, Betty.

16
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
So you will have dinner?

17
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,600
OK, honey, we'll see to it

18
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,600
that you have strawberry and vanilla ice cream.

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Just rest now.

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
You need some rest to help you get better quickly.

21
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Hi, Frank.

22
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,600
How you doing?

23
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Oh, come on now.

24
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
You're a big boy.

25
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
It doesn't hurt that much, does it?

26
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Oh, I'm sorry it hurts so much,

27
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
and you won't be able to have dinner.

28
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
You're just going to have to have ice cream.

29
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Yes, ice cream.

30
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Lots of flavors.

31
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Want to hear them?

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Chocolate?

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Then chocolate it is.

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
One scoop or two?

35
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Three scoops?

36
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Then three it will be.

37
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:57,600
You want three scoops also?

38
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Chocolate, too?

39
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Well, I see you're feeling better.

40
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Well, at least you're acting like you feel better.

41
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Three scoops of chocolate ice cream for Tim coming up.

42
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Hi, Carl.

43
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
How you doing?

44
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,600
I know it hurts.

45
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,600
But it'll be better tomorrow.

46
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
In the meantime, what would you like?

47
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Surprise.

48
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
A surprise?

49
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,600
I promised you a surprise, didn't I?

50
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
And it wasn't just ice cream, was it?

51
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Your birthday is tomorrow, isn't it?

52
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Well, maybe, just maybe,

53
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
there will be a surprise.

54
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
But first you have to smile.

55
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,600
I just want to see one smile from you.

56
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,600
No smile, no surprise.

57
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,600
That's the deal.

58
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
No smile, no surprise.

59
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
If you want a surprise,

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
then you've got to smile first.

61
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:30,600
How are you all doing?

62
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Well, I'm glad you're feeling better

63
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
because we have a little surprise for you today.

64
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
It's Carl's birthday,

65
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
and we have Popo the Clown to entertain you.

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
And here he is--Popo the Clown.

67
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Happy birthday, Carl.
Happy birthday.

68
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
All right, everybody.

69
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
OK, Carl.

70
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
It's your birthday.

71
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
What 's your wish?

72
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
What would you like?

73
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Hmm?

74
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,600
You want to play charades?
