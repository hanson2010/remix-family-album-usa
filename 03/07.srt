1
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Marilyn, you want coffee or tea? Marilyn

2
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Coffee, please.

3
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:34,600
I am so excited!

4
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
At this time tomorrow morning,

5
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Grandpa will be sitting in the kitchen with us.

6
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,600
When does he arrive?

7
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
At six o'clock this evening.

8
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
By plane?

9
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
No, by train.

10
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Are we picking him up at the station?

11
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Not Grandpa.

12
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,600
He doesn't want anybody picking him up.

13
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
He likes to be independent.

14
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Oh, let's go upstairs and prepare Grandpa's room.

15
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Great! Let's do it!

16
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Good morning, Mom.

17
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Morning.

18
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Well, hi, fellas.

19
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,000
Hello.

20
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,600
Hi, honey.

21
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Morning, Marilyn.

22
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
We are going upstairs to set up Grandpa's room.

23
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
There's coffee ready.

24
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,600
I'm really excited about seeing Grandpa.

25
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Me, too. Milk, please.

26
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
He's so funny.

27
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
He always makes me laugh.

28
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,600
I hope Grandpa's going to like living with us.

29
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
I think he will.

30
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,600
It just takes time to feel comfortable in a new place.

31
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Won't he miss being in Florida?

32
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Well, he will.

33
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
But I think he'll like being here with the family.

34
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Are you sure about that?

35
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
It's crazy here most of the time.

36
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
But it's fun.

37
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
That's for sure.

38
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
You know,

39
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
maybe I'll put together some photos of Grandpa

40
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
as a "welcome" present.

41
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
That's a neat idea.

42
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
What can I do?

43
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
I've got it!

44
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,600
I have a picture of Grandpa and Dad and me in my wallet.

45
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,600
It's from the Fathers and Sons' Breakfast

46
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
at my junior high school graduation.

47
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Oh, I remember this picture.

48
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,600
I'd really like to pick up Grandpa at the railroad station.

49
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Railroad stations or airports--

50
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Grandpa always tells us he'll get here by himself.

51
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
He's something!

52
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Is this all Grandpa's stuff?

53
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
That's it.

54
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,600
But I'm sure he has a few bags with him on the train.

55
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
What's inside?

56
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,600
I don't know. It's locked.

57
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Hi.

58
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Oh, hi, darling.

59
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Morning, Philip.

60
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,600
I want to put some of my good hangers in Grandpa's closet.

61
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,600
You know I'm very excited about his arrival.

62
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
We are, too.

63
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Susan called early this morning. Susan

64
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
She's unhappy

65
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,600
because she's had to go to Chicago on a business trip

66
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
and can't leave till tonight.

67
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
She wants to be here for Grandpa.

68
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Well, Grandpa will be disappointed, too.

69
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
He loves Susan.

70
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
She always reminds him of Grandma. Susan

71
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Well, how's everything here?

72
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Fine. We were just wondering about this trunk.

73
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
It's locked.

74
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Oh. I have the key. Grandpa sent it to me.
