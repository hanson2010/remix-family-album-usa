1
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
What's this?

2
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Read it.

3
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,600
I can't.

4
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Would you read it, Marilyn?

5
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,600
"Richard Stewart's show at the Carlson Gallery"

6
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,600
is a collection of photographs

7
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
from his new book entitled "Family Album, U.S.A."

8
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,600
There is power and beauty in Mr. Stewart's work,

9
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
and his book

10
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
introduces us to a remarkable new talent.

11
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Oh, Richard, it's wonderful!

12
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Congratulations!

13
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,600
Wow! I'm overwhelmed.

14
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
if I may have your attention for a moment, please?

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,600
I hope you're all enjoying the exhibition.

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
I know that I am.

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,600
And I would like to introduce the young man

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
who spent the last five years

20
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,600
taking these remarkable pictures

21
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,600
and writing the background for Family Album, U.S.A.

22
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Mr. Richard Stewart.

23
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Hello.

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,600
I want to thank all of you for coming here tonight.

25
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,600
I'd like to thank Harvey Carlson

26
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
for his faith in my project.

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,600
But most of all,

28
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
I would like to thank my family

29
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,600
for their love and support all through this adventure.

30
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Thank you.

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Oh, I'm glad that's over.

32
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Would you mind?

33
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Oh, not at all.

34
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Thanks.

35
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Our pleasure.

36
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Hope it wins a Pulitzer Prize.

37
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
I'll settle for an "A" in my photography course.

38
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Ah, Richard, Marilyn, I want you to meet John O'Neill.

39
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Oh, how do you do?

40
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Nice to meet you.

41
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
I've been looking forward to meeting your husband, Mrs. Stewart.

42
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
I'm really impressed by your show.

43
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Thank you.

44
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
In fact, I'd like your autograph.

45
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Oh, well, really...

46
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
On a contract.

47
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,600
What's this about, Harvey?

48
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Mr. O'Neill is the publisher of several magazines.

49
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Of course. I've seen you on television.

50
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Mr. O'Neill was so impressed with your work

51
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
that he wants to develop it into a magazine concept.

52
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Well, that sounds very exciting,

53
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
but where would I fit into the plan?

54
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
I'd like you to be the photo editor of the magazine.

55
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Oh, Richard, how exciting!

56
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
It's a wonderful opportunity, Richard.

57
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Hold on. Wait a minute, please.

58
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
What's the problem, Richard?

59
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,600
The problem is that I'm a photographer, not an editor.

60
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
I like what I do.

61
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
In fact, I love what I do...

62
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
which is going out with a camera and a roll of film

63
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
and seeing the wonder of humanity.

64
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Now, I appreciate your offer,

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
but I've worked so hard on Family Album, U.S.A.,

66
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
and I'm giving some thought to a new book on a different subject.

67
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
I'm flattered,

68
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,600
but I enjoy taking pictures, and I want to continue doing that.

69
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Thank you,

70
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
but I'm happy being a photographer.

71
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
I understand, Richard.

72
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Richard, I know your next book will be a success.

73
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Congratulations!

74
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Thanks.

75
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:02,600
You're a real Stewart!

76
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Thanks.
