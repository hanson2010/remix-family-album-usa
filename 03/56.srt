1
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,600
And now for... something old,

2
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,600
something new, something borrowed,

3
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,600
and something blue.

4
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,600
OK. Let's see.

5
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
Something borrowed.

6
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,600
That's this dress. Borrowed from Marilyn.

7
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Something blue.

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,600
My wristband.

9
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,600
I wore it when I married your father.

10
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:22,600
Oh, Mother. I forgot you still had it.

11
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,600
It's just so lovely.

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
I bought it in an antique shop

13
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
when I was about eighteen years old.

14
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,600
I saved it for my wedding day.

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,600
And you saved it for me, didn't you, Mother?

16
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Yes, honey. I did.

17
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Are we ever going to finish?

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:53,600
All right. OK.

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Something borrowed.

20
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
The wedding dress. And something blue.

21
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
The wristband. Something old?

22
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Something old.

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Right. What's old?

24
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Of course!

25
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Something old.

26
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
I had planned to wear them.

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Grandma's pearls!

28
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Oh, Grandpa will be so pleased that you're wearing them.

29
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,600
I'm sure he misses Grandma on a day like this.

30
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Help me with them, Marilyn.

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,600
I've never worn them before.

32
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
I've been saving them for today.

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Saving them for today?

34
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Oh, you're a real Stewart!

35
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Oh, there you go.

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Lovely!

37
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Lovely!

38
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Lovely!

39
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Something borrowed, something blue.

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Something old...

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,600
and now for something new.

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
The veil.

43
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Oh, it's so beautiful, Marilyn!

44
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,600
You really are a fabulous designer, Marilyn.

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Doesn't it look just right on Susan? Susan

46
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Perfect!

47
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
And when you both say "I do",

48
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Harry will lift this veil over your head

49
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,600
and kiss the bride.

50
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Oh, I'm so excited!

51
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
When you said "I do", Marilyn,

52
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,600
it suddenly became real.

53
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
That's all right, Susan.

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
You've got the wedding-day jitters!

55
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,600
In less than two hours,

56
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
you will be Mrs. Harry Bennett.

57
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Oh, that reminds me.

58
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
If we don't get dressed,

59
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
we won't be there

60
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,600
to see Susan become Mrs. Harry Bennett.

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Before you leave, do I look all right?

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
You never looked better.

63
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Mom.

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
She's right.

65
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,600
And that's dear little Max.

66
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Got to go and feed him.

67
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
What am I supposed to do?

68
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Take off the veil,

69
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
kick off your shoes, and sit down.

70
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,600
We'll come upstairs and get you in a little while.

71
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Richard's going to take some wedding pictures

72
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
before the ceremony.

73
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
So just relax.

74
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Are you kidding? Relax?

75
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Susan Stewart...

76
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,600
you are about to become Susan Bennett

77
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Mrs. Harry Bennett.
