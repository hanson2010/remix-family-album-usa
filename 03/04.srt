1
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Excuse me. Can you help me?

2
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Sure, what do you want?

3
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Where is 83 Wooster Street?

4
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That's easy. Walk to the corner.

5
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Then make a left turn.

6
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Then walk two blocks to the traffic light.

7
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Make another left to Wooster.

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Thank you.

9
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
To the corner and then a left?

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah. A left.

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Hot dog? Only seventy-five cents.

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
No. Thank you. I have a dinner date.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:55,000
555-9470... and it's busy.

14
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Try again.

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:11,000
555-9470... and it's still busy.

16
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Excuse me, ma'am.

17
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm looking for 83 Wooster Street.

18
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes. Wooster Street is two blocks,

19
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and 83 is to the right, about two houses.

20
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Thank you, thank you!

21
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're welcome.

22
00:03:37,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Who is it?

23
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Harry Bennett. Is this Susan?

24
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes, it is. Come up.

25
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm on the top floor.

26
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hello, Harry. It's nice to meet you.

27
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Nice to meet you, Susan.

28
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Sorry I'm late.

29
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The traffic. The parking. I was lost.

30
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What pretty flowers! Thank you.

31
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, please come in.

32
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Don't worry about being late. It's fine.

33
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Excuse the mess. I just moved here.

34
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh, I'd like you to meet my sister-in-law Marilyn.

35
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Marilyn Stewart, this is Harry Bennett.

36
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Pleased to meet you.

37
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Nice to meet you, Harry.

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Are we too late for our dinner reservation?

39
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No, the restaurant will hold our table.

40
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I know the owner very well.

41
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I eat there a lot.

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Do you know the phone number of the restaurant?

43
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'd like to call home

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and leave the number with the baby-sitter.

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Sure. The number is... five five five... seventeen twenty.

46
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
May I use the phone?

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Five five five...one seven two oh. Hello?

48
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Hi, Michelle. It's Daddy.

49
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Can I speak to Betty?

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I want to leave the phone number of the restaurant...

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hi, Betty. I'll be at five five five... seventeen twenty.

52
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
OK. Thanks. See you later.

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Well, that's done. Shall we go?

54
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm ready. See you later, Marilyn.

55
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Have a nice evening.

56
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Bye, Marilyn. Hope to see you again.

57
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Me, too. Have fun!

58
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Thanks.

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
After you.
