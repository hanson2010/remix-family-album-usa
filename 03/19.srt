1
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Robbie, this new Walkman is absolutely wonderful. Robbie

2
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Richard and Marilyn bought it for me for my birthday.

3
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,600
They're so thoughtful.

4
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,600
You are very lucky, Robbie, to have such a nice family. Robbie

5
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Is something wrong, Alexandra? Alexandra

6
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
No, nothing.

7
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Yes, there is.

8
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
I can tell.

9
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
What's the matter?

10
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Come on, you can tell me.

11
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
What's up?

12
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
I don't know.

13
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Something's wrong.

14
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,600
OK, let's talk.

15
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I received a letter from my parents this morning.

16
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Did they write some bad news?

17
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
No.

18
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Well, then why are you so sad?

19
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
I miss them.

20
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
I miss them very much.

21
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I'm sorry, Alexandra.

22
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
But I understand.

23
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,600
The Molinas treat me so nicely, Molina

24
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,600
and I love being with your family so much ...

25
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,600
but when I received the letter

26
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
with photographs of my family, I cried.

27
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,600
I cried because I miss them all.

28
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
You really miss your family, don't you?

29
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Yes. I know I must seem silly.

30
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,600
It's not like I have nobody.

31
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
I like the Molinas very much,

32
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
and they're so kind to me.

33
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Hey, why don't we go out

34
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
for a cheeseburger and french fries?

35
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
That'll cheer you up.

36
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,600
And you can use my Walkman.

37
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
That's a good idea.

38
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
But if we go out,

39
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,600
please don't complain

40
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
about your math teacher or your math homework.

41
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
I want to have fun.

42
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
So do I.

43
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I have to turn off the lights,

44
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
or else my father will get really angry.

45
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,600
He says I never turn them out when I leave.

46
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
If they come home and they're on ...

47
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Do you hear something?

48
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Yes.

49
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
What was that?

50
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
It sounded like a dog barking.

51
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
It sounded like a dog barking right here.

52
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Yeah.

53
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
A dog!

54
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
A springer spaniel!

55
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Come on in!

56
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Make yourself at home.

57
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Oh, you poor little thing.

58
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Come here.

59
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Come on.

60
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Poor baby.

61
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Where did you come from?

62
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Her name's Gemma,

63
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,600
and she belongs to Mr. and Mrs. Levinson.

64
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
There's a phone number --

65
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
five five five ... eight four four eight. 555

66
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Robbie, maybe you should call them Robbie

67
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
and tell the Levinsons we have their cute little spaniel.

68
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
I've always wanted a springer spaniel.

69
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
She's so cute.

70
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:39,600
The number you are calling -- 555-8448 --

71
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
is no longer in service.

72
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,600
The number's no longer in service.

73
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Oh, you poor, poor baby.

74
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
You've lost your family.

75
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
We'll find them.

76
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Don't worry, Alexandra.
