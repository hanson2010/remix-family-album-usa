1
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,600
It's almost ten o'clock.

2
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,600
I've got to go. Tomorrow is Monday,

3
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
and work begins at eight in the morning for me.

4
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Oh, I'm so happy that Max is home.

5
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
He's the sweetest little thing.

6
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,600
I'll drive you to the station, dear.

7
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,600
You can catch the ten-twenty train to Grand Central Station.

8
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,600
I'll drive Susan, dear.

9
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,600
Thank you, Philip.

10
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
Then Grandpa, Robbie,

11
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,600
and I can finish wrapping all these gifts.

12
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,600
It's so good to have you home again...

13
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,600
and to see Max asleep in his bassinet at home with us.

14
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,600
To be with our family and all that Stewart TLC.

15
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,600
TLC - tender loving care.

16
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,600
That's our motto.

17
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Did you see the washcloth

18
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
and the towels with the teddy bears on them?

19
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Alexandra and the Molinas sent them for Max.

20
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
It was so kind of them.

21
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Now Max has come into everyone's life.

22
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
The house is so alive with him here.

23
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,600
The welcome sign over the door.

24
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,600
The boxes of presents.

25
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
The M-A-X over his bassinet.

26
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Robbie put that there.

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Susan's teddy bear.

28
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,600
So cuddly. The beautiful crib from Mom and Dad.

29
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Oh, and Grandpa's baseball glove.

30
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,600
You know, it hung over my crib, too.

31
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,600
And it hung over Robbie's crib.

32
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Part of Grandpa's magic?

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Oh, that's not all.

34
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
It hung over Susan's crib.

35
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
The same baseball glove?

36
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,600
That's right. Grandpa hangs it there for good luck.

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
He says it always brought him good luck on the baseball team.

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,600
He believes it'll bring good luck to all the Stewart babies.

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
And then he takes it back

40
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
when Max is ready to use it?

41
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Yes,

42
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
and replaces it with a new glove

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
so the old one will be ready

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
for a new member of the Stewart family.

45
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Grandpa really loves his family, doesn't he?

46
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,600
So do I.

47
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
And so do I.

48
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:02,600
And so does Max.

49
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
After he eats!
