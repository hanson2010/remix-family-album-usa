00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Hello there, Robbie.

2
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
What are you doing up this late?

3
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
Reading.

4
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Reading?

5
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
At this hour?

6
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Ah, come on, Robbie.

7
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
What are you doing up this late?

8
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Things on my mind.

9
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Do you care to talk about them?

10
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Sure,

11
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
if you don't mind listening.

12
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Robbie, Robbie, remember me?

13
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
I'm your mother.

14
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,600
If you have something you want to talk about,

15
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
I'm always prepared to listen.

16
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,600
You haven't been around much lately.

17
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
So that's it.

18
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
OK, let's talk.

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,600
You and Dad are like ships that pass in the night.

20
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Dad works hard, and he works late.

21
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
You work hard on all your committees,

22
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
and you work late.

23
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
I thought you were proud of the work I do.

24
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
I am, Mom.

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Real proud.

26
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,600
You are one fantastic mom,

27
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,600
but ... but I've been noticing

28
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
how little quality time

29
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,600
you spend with Dad and me... and the family.

30
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,600
It's a real problem, Robbie.

31
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
I know it.

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I'm concerned.

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
There must be a way

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,600
that Dad and you can spend more time together.

35
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Well, we always talk about

36
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
taking a vacation together with the family.

37
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
I think you ought to

38
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
take a vacation away from the family, alone.

39
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Kind of a second honeymoon.

40
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,600
It would be wonderful,

41
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
but our schedules won't allow it.

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
I think I have an idea.

43
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
You do?

44
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Yup.

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
I think I have an idea

46
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
that will bring Dad and you

47
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
together in a more scheduled way.

48
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
What is it?

49
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Well,

50
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
you know how Dad is always talking about

51
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
the kids in the ward

52
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
and how important it is for them to be paid attention to?

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Yes.

54
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Well...

55
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
and how hard it is

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
because the doctors and nurses are so busy?

57
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Yes.

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Well, how would it be if you took some time

59
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
to work with Dad towards solving that problem?

60
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
I don't get it.

61
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Like setting up a regular weekly reading program.

62
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
You and Dad.

63
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
You and Dr. Philip Stewart--

64
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
going to the children's ward once or twice a week

65
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
and reading to them.

66
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Not bad.

67
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Not a bad idea, Robbie.

68
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
As a matter of fact,

69
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
it fits right in with something I'm working on right now

70
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
with the school-board committee.

71
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
What's that?

72
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
I've been trying

73
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
to work out a program

74
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
in the public school

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,600
that will bring parents and teachers together once a week

76
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,600
to read to the students - their own children, really.

77
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
By doing that, it will encourage reading.

78
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
So it might fit in with a program

79
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
for reading to the kids in the hospital.

80
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
You're right.

81
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
We'll do it!

82
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
I'm going to talk to Daddy about it right now.

83
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,600
But Dad was so exhausted when he came home from work.

84
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Why don't you talk to him about it tomorrow?

85
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,600
You are a very smart young man, Robbie.

86
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I think I'll wait until tomorrow.

87
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
You won't forget, will you?

88
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Believe me, I won't.

89
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
It is a great idea,

90
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
and I promise you I won't forget.

91
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Thanks, Mom.

92
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Thank you, Robbie.
