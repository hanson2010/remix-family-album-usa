1
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,600
You like living in New York, don't you?

2
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Oh, I love it.

3
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
It's so convenient.

4
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
I can take the bus to work...

5
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
or the subway...

6
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
or a taxi.

7
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
And there's so much to do.

8
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Lots of movie houses, and the theater.

9
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
I know what you mean.

10
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
I'd like to live in the city,

11
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
but living in New Jersey and the suburbs

12
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
is better for Michelle.

13
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Trees, grass.

14
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,600
There's a lot of good things about suburban living.

15
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I grew up in Riverdale, remember?

16
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
So I know.

17
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
But, as a working woman,

18
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
I think New York has all the conveniences,

19
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
including the best tomatoes.

20
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,600
The truth is, I'd like to live in the city.

21
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Michelle's the right age. Michelle

22
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
There are lots of things for her here.

23
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
You're right, Harry.

24
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Today is the perfect example.

25
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Michelle and her friends are at the aquarium in Brooklyn.

26
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
They come back here for lunch,

27
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
then go uptown to the Museum of Natural History.

28
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
There's so much for young people to see and do.

29
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
It's just incredible!

30
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Not just for young people.

31
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
What about me?

32
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
I've never been to the aquarium

33
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
or the Museum of Natural History. Have you?

34
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Oh yes, Harry.

35
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
My mother and father

36
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
often took us somewhere in the city on the weekends.

37
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Dad was a busy doctor,

38
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
but he usually managed to squeeze a Sunday in

39
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
with Richard, Robbie, and me.

40
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,600
I used to love to go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

41
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
I've been there several times.

42
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Twice with Michelle.

43
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,600
You ought to think about spending more time with Michelle

44
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
at all the great places in the city.

45
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Well, perhaps,

46
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,600
you'll help me select some of the great places.

47
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
And perhaps, you'll join us?

48
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Perhaps I will.

49
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Well, there we are.

50
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
All set for lunch, Harry.

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
It looks inviting.

52
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
I wish Michelle and her friends would get here.

53
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
I'm starving, aren't you?

54
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,600
I can't wait to take a bite of the pumpernickel.

55
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
It smells so delicious.

56
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Coming! Coming!

57
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Who is it?

58
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Michelle.

59
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
It's us, Susan.

60
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Come in, Michelle,

61
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
and bring your friends along.

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
We're on the fifth floor.

63
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Oh, you've been here before.

64
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Susan,

65
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,600
I really appreciate

66
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
your doing this for Michelle and her friends.

67
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Oh, please, Harry.

68
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
It's nothing.

69
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm not just doing it for Michelle.

70
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
I'm doing it for you.

71
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Thank you.

72
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm doing it for us, Harry.

73
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Well,

74
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,600
it's... it's important for Michelle to see us together more often.

75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
That's true.

76
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
It's important

77
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
for Michelle and me to get to know each other better.

78
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,600
That's important for us.

79
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,600
That makes me feel good.

80
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
What, Harry?

81
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
What makes you feel good?

82
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Well, that you care about Michelle,

83
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
that you care about me, and

84
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,600
that you care about us.

85
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Well, Harry, that's because I do.

86
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
I do care.

87
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,600
They'll be here any minute.

88
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Susan, I'd like to continue this conversation later.

89
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Of course, Harry.

90
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
We'll finish the conversation when they go to the museum.

91
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
I'd like that.

92
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
So would I.
