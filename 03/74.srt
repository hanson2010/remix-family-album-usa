1
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Oh, I love it!

2
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,600
I love it!

3
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,600
To be away from the city on such a beautiful day

4
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,600
is my idea of heaven!

5
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,600
The grass. The trees. The fresh air.

6
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,600
I told you you'd like it. I've been doing this for years.

7
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,600
You have the spirit of a teenager, Susan.

8
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Wait till you see yourself jumping around.

9
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,600
That's what I love about Susan.

10
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
She works hard.

11
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
She plays hard.

12
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
She's a real Stewart.

13
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
Come on, Richard.

14
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Help me get this stuff out of the car.

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Where does it go?

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Well, we'll put everything over there.

17
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,600
We'll set up our tents over there by the edge of the woods.

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Then we'll be able to make our fire there where it's safe.

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Oh, there's our table and benches.

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
All set for eating.

21
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
That's what makes this spot so good.

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Is anybody hungry?

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
I am.

24
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
We just got here.

25
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,600
When you're out in the fresh air like this, it makes you hungry.

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Aren't you hungry, Marilyn?

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
I sure am.

28
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
How about you, Richard?

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Starving.

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
You guys are like three kids.

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Aren't you hungry, Harry?

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Well, yeah.

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Now that you mention it, I guess I am.

34
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
I mean,

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
how could a guy not be hungry with all this talk about eating?

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Where's the bag with the chicken salad sandwiches?

37
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Right here, next to the ice packs. Here.

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Put the tablecloth on the picnic table,

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,600
and I will bring the cola and the plastic cups.

40
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Well, how do you like it so far?

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
I've never been more relaxed.

42
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Me, neither.

43
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,600
I wish we had brought Michelle, Harry.

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
She would have loved it.

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Oh, you're right.

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
I wish we had brought Max.

47
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Marilyn, Susan, let's not begin to worry about Michelle and Max.

48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
We're having a good time, and they're in good hands.

49
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Richard is right.

50
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Are you having a good time, Susan?

51
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
You haven't answered my question.

52
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,600
I am having a good time, Harry.

53
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,600
I promise not to think about the city.

54
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
We're in the country.

55
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Let's all just enjoy this wonderful place

56
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
and this wonderful weather.

57
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Good.

58
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,600
This is heaven, Harry!

59
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,600
It was such a great idea to spend the weekend this way.

60
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Thanks, Susan.

61
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
I thought you'd all like it.

62
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Like it?

63
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Listen to the sounds of the summer that surround us.

64
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
It's so calming.

65
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,600
I've always liked camping out.

66
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Away from the telephones and account books.

67
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,600
It's refreshing for me.

68
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
I always go back to the city in a wonderful state of mind.

69
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,600
We've only been here for a day,

70
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
and I've completely forgotten about all my business problems.

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
The office seems so far away.

72
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
I'm glad you like it, Susan.

73
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
We'll spend many more weekends like this.

74
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
And next time we'll bring Michelle.

75
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,600
I wish she were here with us to enjoy the country.

76
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
And next time we'll bring Michelle.

77
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Just listen to the sound.

78
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,600
It's so soothing.

79
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,600
I can hardly keep my eyes open.

80
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,600
If only we could bottle the fresh air.

81
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Wouldn't it be wonderful?

82
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,600
We could call it "Deep Sleep Country Air."

83
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,600
It puts you to sleep.

84
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,600
So does the sound.

85
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:19,600
I've been having a hard time keeping my eyes open

86
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
just listening to it.

87
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,600
It's like a special music.

88
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Too bad we can't bottle the sound.

89
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
But we can!

90
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Can what?

91
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Bottle the sound.

92
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
What are you talking about?

93
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Oh, yeah?

94
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Great idea!

95
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Let's do it!
