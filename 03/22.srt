1
00:01:50,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Molly, I need your special talent for handling special matters.

2
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Like what special matters?

3
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Well, I have a scheduling problem.

4
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Yes?

5
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,600
I have three tonsillectomies set for Friday with Dr. Earl.

6
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Yes?

7
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,600
I need to fit a fourth operation into his schedule.

8
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,600
And... I know you can do it.

9
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Who's the patient?

10
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Carl Herrera.

11
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
The boy has infected tonsils,

12
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
and we should remove them as soon as possible.

13
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Well, I'll try to arrange the schedule, Dr. Stewart.

14
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
But it's not going to be easy.

15
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,600
I know you'll be able to take care of it.

16
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Well, Mrs. Herrera,

17
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Carl will be perfectly fine after we remove his tonsils.

18
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Thank you for your reassurance, Dr. Stewart.

19
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,600
He's had so many colds and sore throats recently.

20
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Well, it's a very easy operation, Carl.

21
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
You won't feel a thing.

22
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
But when do they do it?

23
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
This Friday.

24
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,600
But Saturday's my birthday.

25
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Well, we could reschedule the operation, Mrs. Herrera,

26
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
but I don't want to put it off too long.

27
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
No, I think it's important to do it now.

28
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,600
We can have a birthday party for you, Carl,

29
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
When you come out of the hospital.

30
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
But it won't be on my birthday.

31
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,600
But your health is more important, Carl. Believe me.

32
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
I don't want my tonsils out.

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Nurse Baker, would you come in, please?

34
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Hello, Mrs. Herrera. Hi, Carl, how you doing?

35
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,600
I don't want my tonsils out.

36
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Come with me, Carl.

37
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
You and I will talk this over.

38
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:53,600
She has a special way with kids.

39
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
She sure does.

40
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Carl, does your throat hurt?

41
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Yes.

42
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
OK. Do you want to get better?

43
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Yes.

44
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
OK. We want you to get better, too.

45
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
You'll have your tonsils out tomorrow,

46
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
and you won't get so many colds anymore.

47
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
But if I have my tonsils out tomorrow,

48
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
I'll miss my birthday party on Saturday.

49
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
I know.

50
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
It's a problem, isn't it?

51
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Let me try to work something out.

52
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
What?

53
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
I have to think about it.

54
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
You're fooling me.

55
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Oh, I'm not, Carl.

56
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Give me a chance to think about it,

57
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
and I'll come up with something.

58
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
A surprise?

59
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Maybe.

60
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
But you just put on your pajamas and robe,

61
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
and I'll think of a surprise.

62
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Will it hurt?

63
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
No.

64
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
There are other boys and girls here,

65
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
and they're having their tonsils out.

66
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
You'll meet them.

67
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
I don't want to.

68
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Change your clothes, Carl.

69
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Everything will be just fine.
