1
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
The mailman just dropped some mail in our box, Grandpa.

2
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Probably a lot of advertising and bills.

3
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Why don't you write to me, Robbie,

4
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
so I can get some interesting mail?

5
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:34,600
You were right, Grandpa.

6
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Advertising, bills, bills, advertising.

7
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Yes. It's just like I said, Robbie.

8
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Nothing interesting.

9
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,600
You won't believe it, Grandpa,

10
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
but there's a letter here addressed to you,

11
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Mr. Malcolm Stewart, and it looks like a personal letter.

12
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Oh, it must be a bill.

13
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I don't think so.

14
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
The return name and address is

15
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Pete Waters, RFD Number 1, Chesterton.

16
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
You're joking. Pete Waters?

17
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Pete Waters, RFD Number 1, Chesterton.

18
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
You know him?

19
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Do I know Pete Waters?

20
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,600
You bet I do!

21
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
He was my roommate in college.

22
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:23,600
He visited with Grandma and me in Florida

23
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
about five years ago.

24
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:33,600
What does he say?

25
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Is he OK?

26
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Yeah, he's fine.

27
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Just fine.

28
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,600
He's writing to invite me

29
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
to spend a weekend with him at his farm.

30
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
He's planning a get-together

31
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
with two or three other college friends.

32
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,600
A kind of a fifty-year anniversary reunion.

33
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Sounds like fun.

34
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Fifty years? Wow!

35
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
It sounds like fun to me, too, Robbie.

36
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
What kind of farm does he have?

37
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
I've never been there, Robbie,

38
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,600
but he has chickens and cows and all.

39
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,600
That means fresh eggs and fresh milk.

40
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Does he have a family?

41
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
No, he doesn't, Robbie.

42
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
He never married.

43
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
He's not as lucky as I am

44
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
to have a family and grandchildren.

45
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
I'm a lucky man.

46
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
How come he never got married?

47
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
That's a good question, Robbie.

48
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
A very good question.

49
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
He never married because

50
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,600
the girl he was in love with in college married someone else.

51
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
As simple as that.

52
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
He never got over it.

53
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
He must have loved her very much.

54
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Yes. Very much.

55
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Lillian Winters.

56
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
She was in our class.

57
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
And what happened?

58
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,600
She was in love with Donald McGrath,

59
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
the quarterback on our football team.

60
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Football players are always popular with the ladies.

61
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
She liked Pete, and they went to dances together.

62
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,600
But her heart was with Donald.

63
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Did he ever get over it?

64
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
No, he never did.

65
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Where is she today?

66
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
I don't know.

67
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Maybe Lillian will be at the reunion.

68
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
You think so?

69
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Pete's full of surprises.

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
I wish I could go there with you, Grandpa.

71
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
What do you think the surprise will be?

72
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,600
With Pete, you never know, Robbie.

73
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Won't it be exciting to see all your college friends there again?

74
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
It is already.

75
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,600
I'm kind of excited about going now.

76
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Next weekend...

77
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,600
sleep over Friday and Saturday night

78
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
and come back Sunday.

79
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,600
I can't wait!

80
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Don't you think you ought to call Pete

81
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
and tell him you're coming?

82
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
You're reading my mind, Robbie.
