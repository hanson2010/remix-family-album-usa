1
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
Hi, everyone. Sorry I'm late.

2
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,000
But Alexandra and I

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
have been busy at work this morning

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,400
on the community-center project.

5
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,000
And we brought someone along who can help.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You remember Charles Maxwell, Grandpa?

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
He's the editor of the Riverdale paper.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He wrote some nice articles on Mom

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
when she was running for the school board.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes, I remember. You were a great help.

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Hi, Mr. Stewart.

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Hope to be a bigger help on the new community-center project.

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,600
From what Robbie and Alexandra have told me,

14
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,600
you people are making one big story.

15
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Let me introduce you, Mr. Maxwell.

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
This is Nat Baker,

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,600
who's responsible for this meeting,

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,600
and this is Joanne Thompson, and Abe Lucas,

19
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,600
who used to run the drugstore in town.

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Robbie and Alexandra told me

21
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
what you need to fix up the old library.

22
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,600
I am planning to write an editorial that I think will help you.

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Let's go. What are your questions?

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
OK. Now, I have ... first ... a couple of questions here.

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Have you talked to the community council?

26
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,600
And have you had an engineer come in to do an inspection?

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,600
OK, what do you need most of all?

28
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
People power.

29
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Men and women, young and old, to give us their time.

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
To do what?

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,600
To help scrub the building interior clean.

32
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
So that we can repaint it.

33
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,600
And you also need bodies to do repainting?

34
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
That's right.

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,600
And we'll also need some ladders

36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
and some brushes and some paint.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
When do you need the volunteers,

38
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
and where do they report?

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
I've got the council to agree

40
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,600
to open the building for us on the next four weekends.

41
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
How about furnishings?

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Are there any special requirements that I should list in the paper?

43
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Yes.

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Here is a copy of all the things we need to start with.

45
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Let's see. Four desks.

46
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Eight straight-back chairs. Thirty folding chairs.

47
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Six table lamps. Three end tables. One piano.

48
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
This is a good start.

49
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,600
These items shouldn't be difficult to come by

50
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
once I print the article in the paper.

51
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
This community has always been very generous.

52
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I agree, Mr. Maxwell.

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
What you're saying is, in order for this center to succeed,

54
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
we need to put together volunteers

55
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
from the various generations of future users.

56
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
That's right.

57
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,600
And without their energy and stamina,

58
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
there's no way we can complete this project.

59
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I've got it. Now give me some information about

60
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
how you see the building being used.

61
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Oh, here. On the ground floor we have the reception area ...

62
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,600
It's here, Robbie.

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Charles Maxwell lived up to his word.

64
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,600
"At the Stewart family home on Linden Street yesterday,

65
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,600
a group of caring Riverdale citizens gathered

66
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,600
to plan the refurbishing of the old library

67
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
to transform it into a new community center.

68
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
The original plan by the council

69
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,600
was tabled because of lack of funds.

70
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
The new plan needs you.

71
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,600
You could call it a community unity plan.

72
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,600
It needs your time, and it needs your energy.

73
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,600
And it needs your contributions of furniture,

74
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,600
paint, brushes, ladders, lamps, et cetera.

75
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,600
A list of these items and a volunteer form

76
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,600
can be picked up at the Riverdale Press offices.

77
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,600
By working together,

78
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,600
this community can do anything to benefit its citizens,

79
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
and we know you will all work together

80
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
towards refurbishing the old library

81
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
and making it a new community center.

82
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Charles Maxwell, Editor."
