1
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,600
I really like this one Susan. Do you?

2
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Turn around, Michelle. Let me see the back of it.

3
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,600
I like it a lot. It fits well.

4
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,600
It doesn't need any alterations. We must've bought the right size.

5
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
I like the color. She looks good in blue.

6
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
I like blue, too, Daddy.

7
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,000
Try on the skirt and blouse outfit, Michelle.

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,600
The one that Daddy wanted you to wear.

9
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
OK.

10
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Michelle has been a different kid since we've been married.

11
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
She's never been happier.

12
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
And I've never been happier, Harry.

13
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,600
I love her very much. She's been a joy.

14
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,600
We're very lucky, the three of us...

15
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,600
and becoming part of the Stewart family, too.

16
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,600
We couldn't ask for anything more, could we?

17
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Well...

18
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Well...? Could we ask for anything more?

19
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Well... we...

20
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
How do you like it, Daddy?

21
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
It's my favorite outfit.

22
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,600
It's good for every day. It will be good for school, Michelle.

23
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,600
I like it, too. I always like skirts that go like this.

24
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Do you want to see the winter jacket on me, Susan?

25
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Yes, I do. Change back into your jeans,

26
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
and put on the new winter jacket we bought today.

27
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
OK.

28
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:07,600
What did you mean by "well"?

29
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
You had something on your mind

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,600
when I said we couldn't ask for anything more.

31
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Is everything all right?

32
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Everything is fine, Michelle.

33
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Let's take a look at the winter jacket. Come on over here, honey.

34
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,600
It's kind of warm.

35
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
It is. That's why we bought it for you.

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,600
This will be a perfect jacket for the wintertime

37
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
when it's very cold out.

38
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,600
But it's kind of small also. We must've bought the wrong size.

39
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Looks like we should've bought a bigger one.

40
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
I guess we'll have to exchange it, too.

41
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
I'm sure the store has others.

42
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
I look silly! It is too small!

43
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
You're growing so fast, Michelle.

44
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Can I take it off? I'm hot!

45
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Sure. Put it back in your room, and we'll hang everything up later.

46
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Well, are you going to tell me what's on your mind, Harry?

47
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,600
I have been offered a job with a major accounting company

48
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
in Los Angeles.

49
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,600
I have been offered a job with a major accounting company

50
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
in Los Angeles.

51
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Los Angeles? That's a big decision.

52
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,600
I know. It will also affect you and your job, if we decide to go.

53
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Wow! It sure will. But first tell me about the job, Harry.

54
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
If it's a good one, then we'll make it work for us.

55
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,600
I have a client in the garment business, on Seventh Avenue.

56
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
I do his taxes every year.

57
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,600
He has a big sales office in Los Angeles,

58
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
and the company in Los Angeles

59
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
that does his major accounting work

60
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
is looking for an executive. And he recommended me.

61
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
That's wonderful, Harry.

62
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Yes, but it would mean that we'd have to move to L.A.

63
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,600
What about the salary?

64
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,600
The real discussion comes tomorrow.

65
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Susan, I don't plan to make any decisions

66
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,600
until I have a chance to talk with you about it.

67
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
I understand, Harry.

68
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
And I don't have to make a quick decision.

69
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,600
They know that I'm married and that I have a family.

70
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Well, there's a lot to think about.

71
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,600
If it's a good job,

72
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
then I've got to do some thinking about

73
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
my career opportunities in Los Angeles.

74
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Is everything OK?

75
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Yes, honey.
