00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,600
Hello. Hello there.

2
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Are you ready for lunch with your grandpa?

3
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Oh! Hi, Grandpa. Yes, of course, I am, but my mind isn't.

4
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
What's the matter, Susan?

5
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,600
A real dilemma.

6
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Does it have anything to do with you and Harry?

7
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,600
Yes, but I don't know where to start.

8
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Maybe I can help. Tell me what it is, Susan.

9
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Thanks, Grandpa. Please sit down.

10
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,600
Oh! Harry has been offered a job in Los Angeles.

11
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Well, this is something to think about.

12
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,600
There are so many things to consider. There's Michelle.

13
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,600
I wonder if a move would be a bad thing for her. And my job.

14
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
I don't know if I can get a good job in Los Angeles.

15
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
And what about our family?

16
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Can I tell you what I think?

17
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Tell me.

18
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
I think that you're very successful

19
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,600
and that you have a fantastic reputation in the toy industry.

20
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
I think you could talk to Mr. Marchetta,

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
and I think

22
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,600
he could help you find a real good job in Los Angeles.

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,600
He was very helpful to me, remember?

24
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,600
I suppose I could call him.

25
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,600
But I'm not so sure that I want to leave New York,

26
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
you, and the rest of our family.

27
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Well, I'm not going to kid you, Susan.

28
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
You know we'd all miss you.

29
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,600
But this should be your decision.

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,600
It's something that only you and Harry can work out.

31
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,600
If moving to L.A. is in Harry's best interest,

32
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,600
I have to do what I can do to support him.

33
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,600
In every marriage,

34
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
sacrifices have to be made by one partner from time to time.

35
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
And what about Michelle?

36
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Well, what do you think?

37
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,600
I think Michelle is better off staying where she is.

38
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
What does she think?

39
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I don't know for sure.

40
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Well, you'll have to ask her.

41
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
I think I'm going to have a talk with Mr. Marchetta

42
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
and get his feelings about my leaving.

43
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
And about helping me find a job in Los Angeles.

44
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Good idea.

45
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
I'll call him right now. No point in delaying.

46
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Thanks, Grandpa.

47
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Harry, it's the perfect job for you. You'll love it.

48
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
It's a big decision for me, Bill.

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
And I have to discuss it with my wife.

50
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
I don't know if it's right for her.

51
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,600
She'll love it. It's a once-in-a-lifetime offer, Harry.

52
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
OK. Tell it to me again.

53
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
The company is Craft and Craft,

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
the biggest accounting company in the country.

55
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
I know the company well. It's big.

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
The biggest.

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Yeah, yeah. The biggest. When do I have to let you know?

58
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Talk it over. Think it over. Let me know by the end of the week.

59
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,600
When would we have to move?

60
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
As soon as possible.

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
I also have my daughter to consider.

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
I don't want to interrupt her school year.

63
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Let me know by the end of the week.

64
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
It's a great opportunity for you, Harry.

65
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Believe me.

66
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
I know.

67
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Craft and Craft is the biggest in the country.

68
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Yeah, I know. The biggest.

69
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,600
I think Michelle is asleep now. Let's talk.

70
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:55,600
I met with Bill York today.

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,600
And I talked with Mr. Marchetta. Did York make the offer?

72
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Yup. He asked me if I want the job.

73
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
That's exciting, Harry. What was it?

74
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
A vice-presidency

75
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
with the biggest accounting company in the country -

76
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Craft and Craft.

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Aren't you excited about that?

78
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Sure I am. But there's so much more to consider.

79
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,600
I talked to Mr. Marchetta.

80
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
What did he say? Did you tell him about me?

81
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Of course, Harry. I want what's best for you,

82
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
and I think I can get a good job

83
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
through Mr. Marchetta

84
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
in Los Angeles also.

85
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
You're kidding.

86
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
No, I'm not kidding.

87
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
I talked with him, and he understands completely.

88
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,600
He has a major toy buyer in Los Angeles,

89
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,600
and he's pretty sure that I can get a good job there.

90
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Unbelievable!

91
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
But I think we should talk to Michelle about all of this.

92
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,600
You're right. We'll talk to her about it.

93
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,600
And how do you feel about taking the job in Los Angeles?

94
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
How should I feel?

95
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
It's the biggest company in the country.

96
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Well, then you feel good about taking it?

97
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Well... I feel fine about it. Why shouldn't I?
