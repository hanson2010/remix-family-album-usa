1
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,600
You ready for the next problem?

2
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,600
You know what?

3
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,600
I can't look at another number.

4
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
How about a lemonade break?

5
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Sure.

6
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,600
Oh, by the way,

7
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,600
when is your plane reservation for your flight to Athens?

8
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,600
Sunday. Why?

9
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Would you be able to come over Saturday night?

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Yes.

11
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
I should be finished packing by then.

12
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,600
My folks are giving me a little graduation party.

13
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Terrific!

14
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,600
I'll pick you up.

15
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
That isn't necessary.

16
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
My dad's letting me borrow the car.

17
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Oh, well, that would be very nice.

18
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,600
About eight o'clock?

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Eight o'clock is fine.

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Great! It's a date.

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Who's going to be there?

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Just my friend Mike and a few kids from school.

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
I'm going to miss all of you.

24
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
You've been like a second family to me.

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
We're going to miss you.

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Maybe you could come to visit me in Greece?

27
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
I'm counting on it.

28
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Wonderful!

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Are you excited about graduating from high school?

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Sure... and a little scared.

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Scared? Why?

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Aren't you a little scared?

33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,600
I was when I first came to the United States.

34
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
I'd never been away from home,

35
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,600
and I didn't know what it would be like.

36
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,600
But then I found out that people are the same everywhere

37
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
once you get to know them.

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
I'm glad I got to know you.

39
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Thank you.

40
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm glad I got to know you, and your family.

41
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Wouldn't it be nice if we could skip the examinations

42
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
and get right to the graduation party?

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
It would be very nice.

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
But that isn't the way it works.

45
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
So... back to work.

46
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Good night, Robbie.

47
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Good night, Mrs. Stewart.

48
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Thank you for dinner.

49
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Good night, Alexandra.

50
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Will you be all right?

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Yes. The Molinas are waiting for me.

52
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Good night, Alexandra.

53
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,600
I'll pick you up on Saturday night, OK?

54
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Yes.

55
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,600
I have to run.

56
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Good night, Robbie.

57
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:32,600
She's really a good friend, isn't she?

58
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Yeah.

59
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,600
You are going to miss her.

60
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Am I going to miss her?

61
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
That's what I said!

62
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
You are going to miss her!

63
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
I'm going to miss her,

64
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,600
and my math teacher's going to miss her.

65
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Well, you can write to her.

66
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
It's not the same.

67
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
How does that look, Rob?

68
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Great! Pass me the hammer.

69
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
You got it!

70
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
You're sure Alexandra's going to be surprised?

71
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Absolutely.

72
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
She has no idea that the party is in her honor.

73
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Millie, did you bring the tapes for dancing?

74
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
They're in my bag.

75
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
What did you bring?

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Some rock 'n' roll.

77
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Perfect! Alexandra will love it!

78
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,600
I can't wait to see her face when she walks in here tonight.

79
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
What about the cake?

80
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
My mom's decorating it right now.

81
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Robbie, there's a phone call for you.

82
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
It's Alexandra.

83
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
She sounds upset.

84
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
OK.

85
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
I'll take it in there.

86
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Hi, Alexandra.

87
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,600
What? You what?

88
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Oh no!
