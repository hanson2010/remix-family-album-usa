1
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,600
Philip... Ellen.

2
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Ah, Judge.

3
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
How are you?

4
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
I think it's time for the wedding to begin.

5
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,600
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

6
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
Please take your places.

7
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,600
The wedding ceremony is about to begin.

8
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,600
OK, Jane. Start the music.

9
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Dearly beloved,

10
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,600
we are gathered here today

11
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,600
to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.

12
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Do either of you have any reason

13
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,600
why you should not be legally joined in marriage?

14
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Is there anyone present who can show

15
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
any just cause why these two people

16
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,600
should not be legally joined in marriage?

17
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Then, Harry Bennett, do you take Susan Stewart

18
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,600
to be your lawful, wedded wife?

19
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I do.

20
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
And you, Susan Stewart,

21
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
do you take Harry Bennett

22
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,600
to be your lawful, wedded husband?

23
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I do.

24
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
The rings, please.

25
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I have them, Harry.

26
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,600
By the power vested in me by the laws of the State of New York,

27
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

28
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,600
You may kiss the bride now, Harry.
