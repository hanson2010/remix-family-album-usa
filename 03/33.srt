1
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,600
How do you do?

2
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
Hello.

3
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
I'm Ralph Riley.

4
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,600
I'm Richard Stewart, and this is my wife, Marilyn.

5
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Pleased to meet you.

6
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Likewise, Mr. Riley.

7
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Please, sit down. What can I do for you?

8
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,600
We'd like to discuss a mortgage.

9
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,600
For a house.

10
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Fine. Are you buying a house

11
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,600
or are you refinancing your present home?

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
We're planning to buy a house.

13
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,600
And we'd like to find out about a mortgage.

14
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,600
We are customers of the bank.

15
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,600
As a matter of fact, my whole family banks here.

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
I have some questions to ask.

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,600
Do you own your house or do you rent?

18
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
Neither.

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,600
We live with my parents, Dr. and Mrs. Philip Stewart.

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,600
And how old are you?

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
I'm twenty-nine.

22
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
I'm thirty.

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
And, Mr. Stewart, what is your occupation?

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
I'm a freelance photographer.

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
And, Mrs. Stewart, are you working?

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Yes. I'm a designer, and I work in a boutique.

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Did you bring any savings or salary information?

28
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Last year's tax forms?

29
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Yes. Here they are.

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:05,600
OK. What... what kind of house did you have in mind?

31
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
We're talking about buying

32
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
a two-bedroom house in Mount Kisco.

33
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Here are the financial details on the house.

34
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Thank you.

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Are you prepared to make a ten-percent down payment?

36
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Yes, we are.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Payments over thirty years?

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Yes.

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Do you think we can get a loan?

40
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Well, it depends. Do you own any other property?

41
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Any stocks or bonds?

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
No.

43
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,600
I see. Then you don't have any collateral.

44
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Perhaps you could get a guarantor -

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,600
someone to sign for the loan for you.

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Why is that necessary?

47
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Since you don't have enough income,

48
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
and you don't already own any property,

49
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
the bank needs to be sure

50
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
you can pay the mortgage every month.

51
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
A guarantor is responsible for the loan

52
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
if you can't make the payments.

53
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:06,600
I see. Well, the idea of buying a house is exciting.

54
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Thank you, Mr. Riley. We'll read this over carefully.

55
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Thank you.

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Good-bye. Thanks.

57
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Good-bye. And hope to see you soon.

58
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
I hope so, too.

59
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Take care.

60
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Good-bye.

61
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:39,200
It all sounded so easy

62
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,600
until they mentioned needing collateral or a guarantor.

63
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
We have no collateral.

64
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
And I don't think it's a good idea

65
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
to ask Dad to sign as a guarantor.

66
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
I don't feel right about it.

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
I understand your feelings about it, Richard.

68
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Now, tell me, what's the problem?

69
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,600
We can get a loan from the bank

70
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
if we can put up some collateral.

71
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
And we don't own anything to use as collateral.

72
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Or someone can sign with us as a guarantor.

73
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Why don't you speak to Dad?

74
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
No. If we buy a house, I want to be able to handle it alone.

75
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Everybody needs help sometimes, Richard.

76
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,600
I understand Richard's feelings about it, Ellen.

77
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
In two or three months, I'll have an advance on my book

78
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
and be able to put more money down.

79
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
What about the house in Mount Kisco?

80
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Somebody else'll buy it by then.

81
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Then there'll be other houses, Marilyn.

82
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Richard has a point. You're just beginning to look.

83
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
We're in no great rush. It's true.

84
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,600
This has been a great learning experience for us, Marilyn.

85
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Talking to the real-estate agent.

86
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Looking at the houses.

87
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Talking to the loan officer at the bank.

88
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,600
It has been a learning experience. That's true.

89
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
I think you're doing the right thing. Taking your time.

90
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Looking around. Especially with a purchase of this kind.

91
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
You're talking about a lot of money.

92
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,600
We'll call Mrs. Martinelli and tell her to keep looking for us.

93
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
And I'll call Mr. Riley at the bank

94
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,600
and tell him we'll see him in a couple of months.

95
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,600
And if you ever need Dad or me to help you ...

96
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
We know.

97
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,600
You know we'll be there for you.

98
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
It's a Stewart tradition. We're a family.
