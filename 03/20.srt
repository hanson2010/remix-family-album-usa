1
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,600
Don't worry, Alexandra.

2
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,600
We'll find the owner.

3
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
How, Robbie?

4
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Let me think.

5
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Gemma, sit.

6
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Good Gemma.

7
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
Give me your paw.

8
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Good Gemma.

9
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
This dog is well trained.

10
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,600
She likes you, too.

11
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,600
So how are we going to find the owners?

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,600
With a little help from the ASPCA,

13
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,600
the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
They're the ones.

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
We once found a cat.

16
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
She was caught in the branches of our tree.

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
And Dad called the ASPCA.

18
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
They came and solved the problem.

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Robbie, let's call them.

20
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Let me see. ASPCA...

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Here it is.

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
ASPCA Animal Shelter.

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,600
555-7700.

24
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:08,600
(beep...)

25
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Hello, ASPCA.

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Hello, my name is Robbie Stewart.

27
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
I have a lost dog I'd like to bring to you.

28
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
How late are you open?

29
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
We're open till nine P.M.

30
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Thank you.

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
I'll bring the dog over by nine.

32
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Thanks.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,600
Bye.

34
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Thanks.

35
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Good-bye.

36
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
They're still open?

37
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
They're open until nine o'clock.

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
We have two and a half hours.

39
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Let's take Gemma by there now.

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
They'll find the owner.

41
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I hope so.

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,600
I'm so sad to see this little dog without her family.

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
I'm sure they'll find the owner.

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
But if they don't, I'll adopt her.

45
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
She's so cute.

46
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Look at those eyes.

47
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
She's hard to resist.

48
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Don't you just love her?

49
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I'd like to keep her, too.

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
But I'll be going home to Greece

51
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
at the end of the semester.

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,600
She just wants love and affection.

53
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Come on, Robbie.

54
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Let's get her to the animal shelter,

55
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
so they can find her owners quickly.

56
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Don't worry, Gemma.

57
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
We'll get you home.

58
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
It's not easy being away from home.

59
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Come on, poochie.

60
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Atta girl!

61
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Let's go.

62
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,600
We're off to the animal shelter.

63
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:57,600
let's thank taotao

64
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Your name?

65
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Robbie Stewart.

66
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
And this is Alexandra Pappas.

67
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Your name will do, Mr. Stewart.

68
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Your address?

69
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,600
46 Linden street, Riverdale.

70
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Where did you find the dog?

71
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
She found us.

72
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
You tried calling the number on the collar?

73
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Yes, but the number's no longer in service.

74
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
And there's no address on the dog tag?

75
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
There's no other information.

76
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
No ID number.

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Without that, it's hard.

78
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
You will try to find the dog's owner.

79
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Oh, we'll try, believe me.

80
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
And if you don't?

81
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Yes?

82
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,600
If you don't... can I... can I adopt the dog?

83
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Why, yes.

84
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,600
If the owners don't claim the dog in 48 hours,

85
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
then you can apply for adoption.

86
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
How do I do that?

87
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
You really want to?

88
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Yes, I'm serious.

89
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,600
If no one comes to claim Gemma,

90
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
I'd like to adopt her.

91
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
It's not difficult.
