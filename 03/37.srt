1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
There's nothing more joyous than the arrival of a new baby.

2
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
I am so excited. Mother!

3
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Just imagine--Marilyn and Richard must be thrilled!

4
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Oh, a new baby!

5
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Max... Max... Max.

6
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Oh, it's a sweet-sounding name for a sweet little boy.

7
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,600
My first grandchild.

8
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
And my first nephew.

9
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Isn't he just adorable?

10
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,600
He looks a lot like you, Mom. He does.

11
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Do you think so?

12
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Well, I guess. He does look a lot like Richard,

13
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
and I guess he looks a lot like me.

14
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Oh, he's got Richard's eyes, though.

15
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,600
I really want Harry and Michelle to see Max.

16
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,600
When are they coming?

17
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Tomorrow. Harry has an account to work on today.

18
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Yes, he does have Richard's eyes. Big blue eyes.

19
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,600
The baby even looks at you like Richard does.

20
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Well, children usually resemble their parents.

21
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
It's true.

22
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Michelle is a lot like Harry in so many ways.

23
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,600
And she's shy with new people, just like he is.

24
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
You really like Michelle, don't you?

25
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Yes. I'm very fond of her.

26
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
And Harry, too?

27
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Well...

28
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Uh, it's four-thirty. Oh my!

29
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Marilyn and Richard will be home from the hospital any minute,

30
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
and we must prepare this room.

31
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Where will we put all the presents?

32
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Well, let's take everything to the living room.

33
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Marilyn and Richard and the baby need the space.

34
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
It's crowded in here.

35
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
The welcome sign is up:

36
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
"Welcome home, Max."

37
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Isn't it exciting, Grandpa?

38
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Your first great-grandchild.

39
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Yes. Yes, sir.

40
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
A great-grandchild. A great-grandson.

41
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Another generation to carry on the Stewart name.

42
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
I love you, Grandpa.

43
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,600
You make me feel so proud to be part of our family.

44
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
One day, you'll have your own family,

45
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
and I'll be proud to be part of it.

46
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Now you understand my feelings, Susan.

47
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,600
I'm Grandpa's daughter-in-law, but I feel like a Stewart.

48
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
He's always made me feel like his own daughter.

49
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,600
that's because you're so much like us. Wonderful!

50
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Mom, got it.

51
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,600
This will make a nice gift for Marilyn and Richard.

52
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,600
They can keep a record of all of the important dates

53
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
and information about Max's life here.

54
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Let's see.

55
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Name: Max Stewart.

56
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Does he have a middle name?

57
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,600
No, just Max. I like that.

58
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
No, just Max. I like that.

59
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
No middle name. No middle initial.

60
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Like me. I'm Malcolm Stewart.

61
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Just Malcolm Stewart.

62
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
And Max has your initials, Grandpa: M.S. Max

63
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Uh, it must mean something.

64
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Weight: eight pounds six ounces.

65
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Eight-six. Big boy!

66
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
All the Stewart men were big.

67
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Well, Robbie was eight pounds two ounces,

68
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
and Richard was eight pounds three.

69
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,600
And me?

70
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Eight pounds six.

71
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,600
You were big, just like Max.

72
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Eight pounds six, just like me.

73
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,600
That's nice. Length. Length?

74
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Richard says Max is twenty-one inches long.

75
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Twenty-one inches.

76
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Is that tall or average or what?

77
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Tall. All the Stewart men are tall.

78
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Well, Grandpa, you're about five-nine or five-ten.

79
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
I wouldn't call that tall.

80
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,600
I take after my mother's family.

81
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
I take after my mother's family.

82
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,600
They were... they were... they were average.

83
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Mother: Marilyn. Father: Richard.

84
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,600
And lots of pages for Richard's photos of Max.

85
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Speaking of mother and of father

86
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,600
and speaking of Max, I hear the car.

87
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
They're here!

88
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Oh! Oh, quickly! Go, go, go!

89
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Let's see. Oh, welcome home.

90
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Oh, let her in.

91
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Wait with your pictures for a second.

92
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Come on, darlings.

93
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Sweetheart, sit down right here.

94
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Oh, he's so cute! Oh, Marilyn!

95
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Max looks just like Grandpa.

96
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
A real Stewart.

97
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,600
I'm so happy to be home with my family and with Max.
