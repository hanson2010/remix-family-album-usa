1
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,600
It looks wrong.

2
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Hmmm. It is wrong.

3
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Are they always that difficult to make?

4
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,600
The truth is... yes.

5
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
I'll try again.

6
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
At this rate,

7
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
the wedding will take place tomorrow.

8
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Not to worry.

9
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
OK. Here we go.

10
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:46,600
I'm worried, Philip.

11
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
What if we can't tie the tie?

12
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
If we can't tie the tie,

13
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
then there can't be a wedding.

14
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
You'd better not make Harry

15
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
any more nervous than he is.

16
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Don't worry.

17
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
We'll figure a way.

18
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
How're you doing, fellas?

19
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Not so good, Grandpa.

20
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
We can't get this bow tie tied.

21
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Nobody knows how to do it.

22
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Do you?

23
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
No. I never could, either.

24
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Well, you have your own tuxedo.

25
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
How do you tie your bow tie?

26
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Yeah, Grandpa,

27
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
I've seen you in it.

28
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
You look great.

29
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
How do you tie it?

30
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I don't.

31
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
What do you mean?

32
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,600
I never could tie one of those...

33
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
things... bow ties.

34
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,600
I have always worn a clip-on bow tie.

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
A clip-on?

36
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Of course.

37
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Now I remember.

38
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Yes, it's so easy.

39
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
All you do is

40
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
clip it around under your collar.

41
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
We all need one of those.

42
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
The tuxedo rental store.

43
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Do you think they're open?

44
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Should be.

45
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Sunday's their big day.

46
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
I'll call and find out.

47
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Well, if they're not,

48
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
I'll lend you mine, Harry.

49
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
You're the only one

50
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
who really needs to be wearing a tuxedo,

51
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Thanks, Grandpa.

52
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
I'm the father of the bride.

53
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
I'm supposed to be worried about my daughter,

54
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
and here I am with

55
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
the man that's marrying my daughter

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
worrying about him.

57
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Poor Harry.

58
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
I know the feeling.

59
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Wedding-day Jitters.

60
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Are they open?

61
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
We're in luck.

62
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
They're open.

63
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
And they have lots of clip-on bow ties.

64
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
I'll bicycle down to the village and get them.

65
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
You'd better hurry, Robbie.

66
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
There's lots of time.

67
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
A little over two hours.

68
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,600
In two hours and fifteen minutes

69
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
I'll be married to Susan.

70
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,600
And be a true member of the Stewart family.

71
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Oh, you're a lucky guy, Harry.

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Susan is one of the best women you'll ever find.

73
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
She's just like her grandma.

74
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Now, once you put the ring on Susan's finger,

75
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
you are one of us, Harry.

76
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
And don't ever forget it.

77
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Ring? Ring?

78
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Oh my!

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
What did I do with the rings?

80
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,600
I put them in the pocket of my sports jacket.

81
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
No,

82
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
I think you put them

83
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
in your tuxedo jacket pocket.

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Remember?

85
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Right.

86
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,600
What did I do with the rings?

87
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Didn't you give them to Richard?

88
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
He's your best man.

89
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
I remember.

90
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
You gave them to Richard.

91
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Oh, yeah.

92
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
I remember now.

93
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
You handed them to me.

94
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
What did I do with them?

95
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
I hope they aren't lost.

96
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Oh, don't worry, Harry.

97
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
They have to be here.

98
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
I remember.

99
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
I gave them to Robbie to hold

100
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
so I wouldn't lose them.

101
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Where's Robbie?

102
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Relax, Harry.

103
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Robbie went to pick up

104
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
the clip-on bow ties.

105
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Oh, I forgot.

106
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
What time is it?

107
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
It's still a little over two hours, Harry.

108
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Just relax.

109
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
What about the rings?

110
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
I'm sure Robbie has them.

111
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:41,600
No, no, Robbie doesn't have them.

112
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
He gave them to me to hold on to them

113
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
because he didn't want the responsibility of holding them.

114
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
I put them in my tuxedo,

115
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,600
but in the lapel pocket.

116
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,600
That's a relief.

117
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,600
I was really worried.

118
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I'll hold on to them for you.

119
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
The best man always keeps the rings.

120
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
You're right.

121
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
You hold on to them so there won't be a problem later.

122
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Well,

123
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
now, I think we'd better get dressed, fellas.

124
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
All right!

125
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Robbie will bring the ties back.

126
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Hey, leaving me?

127
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
You'll be fine.

128
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Try to take it easy.

129
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
It'll all be over in two hours.

130
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Over?

131
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
The wedding ceremony will be over.

132
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
You'll be husband and wife.

133
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
I guess you're right.

134
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Two hours from now.
