1
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,600
OK.

2
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,600
If you want to adopt an animal,

3
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
first we need to know some references.

4
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,600
References?

5
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
People we know?

6
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Friends, teachers...

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
We need to talk to some people about you.

8
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,600
We want to be sure that you're responsible

9
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
and that you can take good care of an animal.

10
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,600
Then you have to fill out this form

11
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
about your family background.

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,600
Is that it?

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,600
No, there's more.

14
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,600
We need to know about your history with animals.

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Have you ever owned an animal?

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Yes.

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,600
We had a cat when I was eight years old.

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
I love cats.

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Do you have any animals now?

20
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Unfortunately, no.

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,600
Anything else?

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
We also like to know

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
your reasons for wanting an animal.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Just to hold it and cuddle with it.

25
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Just to have as a pet.

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
I love animals.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,600
To have a friend - a pal.

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,600
You know, man's best friend is his dog.

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
And one thing more.

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
If you're under 21 years of age...

31
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
That's me.

32
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Then an adult must sign for you.

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Uh-oh.

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
No problem.

35
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
My parents will think it's a good idea.

36
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
I'll be back with them.

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
If the real owners don't come to claim Gemma...

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
After forty-eight hours.

39
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
But please call first.

40
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Thanks for your information and for being so helpful.

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
It's my pleasure.

42
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Nice talking to both of you.

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Thanks again.

44
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Bye.

45
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Maybe the real owners will come to claim her.

46
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Her eyes look so sad.

47
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
She must really miss them.

48
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I see you're both animal lovers.

49
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
We are.

50
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Good-bye, Miss Aborn.

51
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
We'll call in a couple of days.

52
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Good-bye, and thanks for bringing Gemma in.

53
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Bye.

54
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:53,600
I keep thinking about the dog, about Gemma,

55
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
alone in the animal shelter.

56
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
I know.

57
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
But I promise you, Alexandra,

58
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
the dog is just fine.

59
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,600
They're very kind to the animals.

60
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
I know they are.

61
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I mean about her being alone.

62
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Even if they are kind to Gemma,

63
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
she's still alone, without her family.

64
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Ready, folks?

65
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Are you ready, Alexandra?

66
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Yes, I'm ready.

67
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
I'll have the chef's salad, please.

68
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,600
I will have a cheeseburger, medium rare,

69
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
with raw onion, and french fries, please.

70
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Anything to drink?

71
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
A diet cola, please.

72
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Ginger ale with lots of ice for me, thank you.

73
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
I've got it.

74
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Thanks.

75
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Aren't you surprised

76
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
that the animal shelter is so careful

77
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
about finding homes for the animals?

78
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
No, I'm not.

79
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
And a cheeseburger, medium rare,

80
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
with onion and french fries.

81
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
And a ginger ale with lots of ice.

82
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Salad dressing?

83
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Hey, I wanted you to hear my new sound system

84
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
when the dog scratched on the front door.

85
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Let's finish eating,

86
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
and then we'll go back to my house.

87
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
I want you to hear my new tapes.

88
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I've got some great new dance music.

89
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:21,600
(music... beep...)

90
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Hello.

91
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Stewart residence.

92
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Hello.

93
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Is Robbie Stewart there?

94
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
This is he.

95
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Who's this?

96
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
This is Linda Aborn from the animal shelter.

97
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
It's Linda from the animal shelter.

98
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Yes, Linda.

99
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Hi.

100
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
We have good news and bad news, Robbie.

101
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Oh?

102
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
The good news is that the Levinsons have come by

103
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
to pick up the dog.

104
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,600
The bad news is, you won't be able to adopt the dog.

105
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
That's OK.

106
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Come by one day and look at some of the other dogs.

107
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
I'm sure there's one for you.

108
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Thanks, Robbie.

109
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
And the Levinsons thank you for bringing their dog to us.

110
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Thanks, Linda.

111
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Bye.

112
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:09,600
The owners claimed Gemma?

113
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
That's right.

114
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
I'm glad for the dog.

115
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
I guess I am, too.

116
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,600
She said if I come by,

117
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
she'll help me find another dog.

118
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Come on.

119
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Let's dance.
