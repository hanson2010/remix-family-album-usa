1
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
Hi, big guy.

2
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
That must be Rita Mae.

3
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
She sure got here quickly.

4
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
That's a good sign.

5
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
She must like you and your work, Marilyn.

6
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,600
I think she's just anxious to see Max.

7
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
She loves children.

8
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,600
Hi, Marilyn.

9
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,600
Welcome.

10
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
It's so nice of you to come.

11
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Oh, I just wanted to see your baby, Max.

12
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
Hello, Rita Mae.

13
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
I haven't seen you since the hospital.

14
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,600
I'm Ellen Stewart, Marilyn's mother-in-law.

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
We met at the hospital.

16
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
How are you?

17
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
How are you?

18
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Oh, and there is Max!

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Oh! My, how he's grown!

20
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,600
A little present for Max.

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Oh, it's beautiful, Rita Mae!

22
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
You shouldn't have.

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
It's nothing.

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
It's just a little present for Max.

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Can I get you some coffee or tea or a cold drink, Rita Mae?

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Oh, nothing, thank you.

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Well, I will leave you two to talk.

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Come on, you big guy.

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Yes, come on.

30
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
That's it.

31
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
It's nice seeing you.

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Let me know if you need anything.

33
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Thanks, Ellen.

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Thanks, Ellen.

35
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,600
OK, Marilyn.

36
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
You sounded like you've made a decision

37
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
when you called me.

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,600
I have made a decision, Rita Mae.

39
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
I've decided to stay at home and be a full-time mother.

40
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,600
I'm disappointed, but I respect your decision.

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,600
If I had a child as cute as Max,

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
I might do the same thing.

43
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
But I haven't finished telling you

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
the other half of my decision.

45
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
The other half?

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Yes.

47
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
I think I can stay at home

48
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
and take care of Max and continue my career.

49
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Sounds interesting.

50
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Let me hear it.

51
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Do you remember

52
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
our talks about custom-designed dresses for the boutique?

53
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
I sure do.

54
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Why can't I design dresses for you here at home?

55
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,000
And make them here.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,900
Have the fittings here, too.

57
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,000
And I could do the selling and the pricing at the boutique.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,600
Exactly.

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Oh!

60
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
What kind of dresses would you design?

61
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,600
I've thought about that for some time.

62
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Yes?

63
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Wedding dresses.

64
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Wedding dresses?

65
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Brilliant idea!

66
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,600
There's a big market today in wedding dresses.

67
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
That's what I thought.

68
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
I like the idea very much.

69
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
And if it's successful,

70
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
we can expand to all kinds of dresses.

71
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
That's what I thought.

72
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
As a matter of fact,

73
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,600
I have a customer for your first wedding dress.

74
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
My niece is getting married,

75
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,600
and I've been trying to find just the right thing for her.

76
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Marilyn, you're going to design my niece's dress. Marilyn

77
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
That'll be our first one,

78
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
and then we'll use it to sell others.

79
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Do you really mean it?

80
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
I really mean it.

81
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
It's a simple idea, and it will work.

82
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,600
You can certainly design dresses.

83
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
I know that.

84
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
And there's no reason why you can't do it from your home.

85
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
I'm so excited!

86
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
I can't wait to tell Richard!

87
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,600
If I had a baby like Max,

88
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
I'd want to stay home and be near him all the time, too.

89
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
You're making the right decision

90
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
for Max and for yourself too, Marilyn.

91
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
It all sounds so easy.

92
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Now the hard work begins.

93
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Would you like

94
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
to see some of my designs that I've been working on?

95
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
I'd love to.

96
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Ooh! Oh, that's wonderful!

97
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Ooh...
