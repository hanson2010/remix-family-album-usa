1
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Sorry, Robbie.

2
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
Sorry to be late this morning,but,

3
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,600
well, we've still got some time for a cup of coffee

4
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,600
I can't wait to see my old pal Charley Rafer.

5
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
Neither can I.

6
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:08,600
So you thought about it, huh?

7
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Yes, I have, Dad.

8
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
Well, I'm glad.

9
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
I knew you'd realize

10
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,600
that this interview could be an important experience for you.

11
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,600
I came to that conclusion.

12
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,600
That's very wise, Robbie.

13
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,600
Very wise.

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Now let's head off for the city and the university club.

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
Thanks, Dad.

16
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
Thanks ... for what?

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Thanks for hearing me out. And ...

18
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,600
And ...?

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,600
And thanks for being such an understanding father.

20
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Well, thank you, Robbie. Thank you.

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Philip Stewart! Philip Stewart

22
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
It's great to see you!

23
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Charley Rafer--you look as young as ever. Charley Rafer

24
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,600
You must be Robbie.

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Hi.

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Yes, this is my youngest son Robbie.

27
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Robbie, I want you to meet Robbie

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
one of the best tennis players on the Michigan team--

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Charley Rafer. Charley Rafer

30
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Nice to meet you, Dean Rafer.

31
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Well, are you as good a tennis player as your dad?

32
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
No, I'm not very good at it.

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Frankly, neither was I.

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Charley was the star of the team. Charley

35
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Yeah. Thanks.

36
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Well, how're you been, Philip?

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Oh, working too hard.

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Doesn't show.

39
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
How's Ellen? Ellen

40
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Fine, thank you.

41
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
And how's Marge? Marge

42
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,600
She's still giving the toughest English history exams

43
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
in the school and loving every minute of it.

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
And speaking of minutes,

45
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
I have interviews until noon,

46
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
so why don't we get right to work?

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Can you have lunch with us later?

48
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
I'd love to, Philip, but I'm afraid I can't.

49
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
I'm only here two days,

50
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
and I have interviews with twenty-six applicants.

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I understand.

52
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Well, thanks.

53
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
I'll wait outside.

54
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Good luck, Son.

55
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Did you bring your transcript from high school?

56
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Yes, sir.

57
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Right here.

58
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Thank you.

59
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Please sit down.

60
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,600
I see under "activities" that

61
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
you've been writing for the school paper.

62
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Yes, sir.

63
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
What kinds of articles have you written?

64
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,600
All kinds--sports, editorials, theater reviews.

65
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
You name it, I've written it.

66
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Hmmm.

67
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Well, have you ever thought of becoming a journalist?

68
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
A professional writer?

69
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Not until recently.

70
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Michigan has a fine School of Journalism. Michigan

71
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Yes, I know that.

72
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,600
You seem to have some reservations.

73
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
I'm a little uncertain.

74
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,600
It's been very nice talking to you.

75
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Nice talking to you, sir.

76
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
One piece of advice.

77
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,600
The most important thing is for you to decide your own future.

78
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Yes, sir.

79
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Good-bye, Dean Rafer.

80
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Good-bye, Robbie.

81
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Good luck.
