1
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Here's the bag.

2
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,600
Will he be OK, Dad?

3
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
I hope so.

4
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,600
That's it.

5
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,600
That's the way.

6
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
That's it. There.

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Oh, it's going to be all right.

8
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,600
That's it.

9
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Wrap him in the blanket, Dad!

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
That's it. That's it.

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,600
It's all right, Albert.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
You're going to be OK.

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,600
I want my daddy!

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
We'll take you to him.

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Easy now. Easy does it. That's it.

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,600
Your dad is quite a guy.

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,600
I know, Grandpa.

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,600
How is he, Philip?

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
He's asleep.

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
He's going to be fine.

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
How can I thank all of you?

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
Thank my son Robbie.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
He pulled him out of the water.

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
I'm very grateful, Robbie.

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Dad saved him, not me.

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,600
I'm so thankful to all of you.

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,600
So long.

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,600
He's a lucky boy.

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Well, what do you say we get back to our fishing?

30
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
That's a great idea.

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Uh-oh. It's probably the hospital.

32
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
I have to get to a phone.

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,600
It probably means we can't stay.

34
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
That's OK.

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:07,600
One of my patients has a high fever,

36
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
and I have to go to the hospital.

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
I'm sorry, Robbie.

38
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
I guess I ruined your day.

39
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
You didn't ruin my day, Dad.

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,600
I understand. I really do.

41
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Why are you back so early?

42
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Philip had to go back to the hospital. Philip

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
He had an emergency.

44
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Oh, that's too bad, Robbie.

45
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Did it spoil your fun?

46
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
No, Mom. We had a great time.

47
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Well, did you do any fishing?

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Yeah, we caught lots of them. Look!

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,600
They had a special on frozen fish down at the supermarket.

50
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Oh, you really had a bad day.

51
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
We had a good day.

52
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Robbie pulled a boy out of the water. Robbie

53
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
And Dad saved his life.

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
He's a terrific doctor, Mom.

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
I know.

56
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Hi, Pop. Hi, Son.

57
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Hello, Dad.

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
What a day!

59
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
How about a cup of coffee, Son?

60
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
I'd love a cup of coffee.

61
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:57,600
How was the patient?

62
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
She'll be fine.

63
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Was it serious?

64
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
No.

65
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Until today, I was never really interested in medicine.

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Well, it's hard work.

67
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Now I know.

68
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,600
I had a good time today, Robbie.

69
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Me, too.

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Why don't we do it again?

71
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Can we? When?

72
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
How about next Saturday?

73
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Won't you be busy?

74
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
I'm changing my schedule.

75
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Well, do we have a date?

76
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
We sure do, Dad.

77
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Grandpa, can you come?

78
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
I have other plans, Robbie.

79
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,600
But I think you two can have a good time together without me.

80
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,600
No, Dad, and certainly not without the right magic.
